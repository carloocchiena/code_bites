2 The digital-native organization
is an important one since just about every area of every business (including
customer interactions and expectations, operational efficiency and productivity,
marketing and communications, sales, logistics and distribution) has
been significantly changed by the impact of digital technologies.
Digital-native organizations may have originated more naturally from
the technology sector, but they now stretch across the widest range of industries
from retail to logistics to marketing to automotive. Yet what they hold
in common is a natural, inherent ability to take a different view on the
world and the competitive markets in which they operate, to take an often
contrasting approach to traditional ways of solving problems, and even
to have a different ‘feel’ to the values and organizational culture that they
embrace. These are capabilities, approaches, processes and cultures that are
informed by the networked, technology-centric world in which we live, but
it is also a shift in mindset. It is as much about the behaviours of individuals
and members of the team as it is the technology or digital solutions they are
providing.
In the same way as people’s early experience helps shape them for the
rest of their lives, so companies that are digital immigrants are required to
unravel a lot of outmoded assumptions, ways of doing things, and organizational
habits in order to rebuild to become not only native speakers in the
digital world, but native do-ers. We call it digital transformation, not digital
adaptation because the change it requires impacts how things get done, how
people work, the way in which the company is structured, and how people
feel when they walk through the door in the morning. In other words the
very fabric of how a company operates, behaves and does business.
This book is about transforming business to be fit for purpose in a digitally
empowered world. Alongside our own insights, we have incorporated into the
text some ‘stories from the frontline’ – contributions from other experienced
practitioners of digital transformation bringing to life their observations
about how to do it well. Our book seeks to capture, distill and define the key
lessons that might be learned in order to help companies on their journey of
transformation towards becoming true digital-native businesses.

The key forces
for change
There can surely be very few businesses that do not feel the vivid and urgent
need to acquire a heightened level of agility in order to deliver against
evolving customer expectation and in response to the challenges and opportunities
brought by digital technologies. Technologies that are impacting
right across the business from marketing and sales, to HR, finance and operations.
Technologies that show little respect for existing business models,
competitive advantage or established best practice. Technologies that are
actively rewiring the way in which entire markets operate with unprecedented
speed and comprehensiveness.
Processing capability has increased exponentially (an Apple iPhone 5
has almost three times the processing power of the 1985 Cray-2 supercomputer)
1 meaning that everyone has a supercomputer in their pocket with
access to virtually universal information. And yet, while these changes may
be driven by technology, they are very far from just being about technology.
If we want to understand the real impact we need to consider the behaviours
that surround the technology. Similarly, if we want to understand how best
to respond to these challenges, we need to consider not only strategies but
our approaches, thinking, mindset and behaviours.
In fact, in this book we are deliberately not focusing on technology. Our
observation before writing it was that there were many discourses on the
need for organizations to change in response the impact of digital, but very
few that gave practical advice, models or methodologies for understanding
what we need to actually do in response to this rapidly shifting environment.
Consequently, we will focus on the ‘how’ of digital transformation
rather than the ‘why’. On the far reaching and comprehensive change that
is needed in the very fabric of how we run our organizations. But it is also
focused on the practical steps that organizations can take to embark on their
own journey towards digital maturity.
But let us begin by summarizing some early context around the key driving
forces that are shaping this urgent requirement. Organizations are currently
sat at the centre of a perfect storm characterized by accelerating change, and
rapidly shifting competitive, consumer and company contexts (Figure 1.1).

4 The digital-native organization
Relentless, accelerating change
In 2006 the world’s most valuable companies by market capitalization
were Exxon Mobile (oil), General Electric (conglomerate), Microsoft (tech),
Citigroup (financial services), BP (oil), Royal Dutch Shell (oil). A decade
later in 2016, that list is dominated by technology businesses, comprising
Apple, Alphabet (the holding company that owns Google), Microsoft,
Amazon, Exxon Mobile (the only non-tech company in the top six) and
Facebook.
Change is not new. Progress has always been with us. Advancement is
a given. But what digital has brought to just about every sector, industry
and business is a transformed scale, scope and pace of change. Meaning
that the required organizational response is not only wide, but deep and
fundamental.
‘Adapt or die’ goes the mantra. The need to transform businesses to
become more native for a digitally empowered world is not only urgent, but
Figure 1.1 Characteristics of change

CHANGE
The key forces for change 5
essential and inevitable. Those that are slow to transform will be left behind,
disrupted and disintermediated.
As far back as 1938, Buckminster Fuller was talking about
‘Ephemeralization’, describing the trend for how technological advancement
means doing ‘more and more with less and less until eventually you
can do everything with nothing’ (Fuller, 1973).2 Joseph Schumpeter, the
economist who taught at Harvard in the 1930s, described capitalism as an
evolutionary process involving a ‘gale of creative destruction’ that sees new
companies and industries continually emerge to remove or replace the old.
But technology has brought a new urgency to this process.
Ray Kurzweil’s renowned 2001 essay ‘The Law of Accelerating Returns’3
famously argues that technological change and therefore progress, evidenced
by historical trajectory, is exponential rather than linear, and that breakthroughs
spawned by technology will be increasingly common.
Research by Professor Richard Foster of Yale University found that the
average lifespan of a company in the S&P 500 index has decreased from
61 years in 1958 to around 15 years today.4 His estimation is that by 2027,
more than three-quarters of the S&P 500 will be companies that we have
not yet heard of.
Yet the picture is perhaps more nuanced than this headline finding
suggests. Analysis done by Boston Consulting Group (Reeves and Pueschel,
2015)5 that looked at the patterns of entry, growth and exit for 35,000
publicly listed companies in the United States since 1950 showed that over
the long term company lifespans have indeed decreased (and mortality risk
increased) yet in the more recent past they have plateaued. Research from
the Santa Fe Institute (‘The mortality of companies’)6 using a database of
25,000 American companies from 1950 to 2009 for example, pegged the
typical half-life of a publicly traded company at around 10 years but found
that the most common reason for a company to disappear is merger or
acquisition.
So while mortality risk for businesses has increased over the long term, the
true picture about the impact of accelerating change on businesses is more
nuanced. High-profile examples of businesses that have failed to innovate
successfully in the face of digital disruption (Kodak, Blockbuster, Nokia)
encourage us to think of the impact of digital and accelerating technological
change in terms of corporate fatality.
6 The digital-native organization
Yet while these examples represent perhaps the most acute result of this
phenomenon, for most organizations the impact of accelerating change is
likely to be reflected in multiple scenarios and challenges that the company
will need to deal with, and all with multiple potential consequences. For
example, by creating a significantly more volatile environment in which the
company operates, unexpected new entrants to the sector, growing competition
from all sides, rapid shifts in customer expectation, fundamental
changes in operating relationships with customers, suppliers and partners,
and accelerated changes in product or service propositions and lifecycles.
In response to relentless, accelerating change, a new heightened level of
agility is not only desirable, but critical to survival. It has never been more
important to determine a defined organizational response to the shifts in our
three crucial contexts: competitive, consumer and company.
Transformed competitive contexts
With barriers to entry in just about every sector dramatically reducing
through ever-cheaper, easier, more flexible and scalable access to cloudbased
support and infrastructure services and markets, the threat from new,
potentially disruptive entrants is concurrently increasing. And it is happening
at an ever-faster pace.
Digital technologies have served to disrupt the power balance in markets
between consumers and organizations. Digital and social platforms have
brought with them the connected and empowered consumer, reducing the
control that businesses have over their brand perception, and creating new
ways to empower discovery, trial and adoption. Greater transparency in
pricing has brought new downwards pressure on pricing towards commoditization
of products and services. The integration of digital into operations
and supply chain brings significant potential advantage in timescales, efficiencies
or costs. The challenges for senior corporate leaders are not only
numerous but varied, emergent and rapidly evolving.
Horizontal innovation (competition
from anywhere)
IBM’s 2015 global C-suite study7 interviewed over 5,000 business leaders
from more than 70 countries and from 21 industries. One of the most
interesting findings focuses on so-called ‘horizontal innovation’ – the idea
that where once it was comparatively easier for senior leaders to be able to
The key forces for change 7
anticipate where competition will come from, there is now a much greater
risk from competition that is invisible until it is too late.
As new digitally empowered businesses scale rapidly in one sector, rewiring
the value chain in a particular market through software, they are then
able to more easily move horizontally into other sectors by reapplying
their capability and expertise in new ways. The net effect is increasingly
blurred boundaries between industries as sectors are brought together and
potentially redefined. When the IBM survey asked senior leaders about the
developments that they expect the next ‘wave’ to consist of, this industry
convergence eclipsed other trends including rising cyber risk, the ‘anywhere’
workplace and the sharing economy.
As we will go on to discuss, digital is, of course, exceptionally adept
at rewriting the rules of competitive advantage but when the potential is
high for rapid disruption to come from anywhere, and disintermediation
(the switching of, or reduction in, intermediaries between producers and
consumers) is happening at pace, we need to reimagine our response and
reorientate our organizations towards a new and consistently higher level of
organizational agility.
The ‘full stack startup’
Competitive threats from horizontal innovation may originate from
anywhere of course, but one of the unique dynamics that digital has enabled
is the increasing potential for disruption from a new breed of ambitious
startups that have in their sights not just incumbent businesses but entire
industries.
These are startups empowered through digital technology to operate at
global scale, access the best talent, reduce communication costs and reach
far broader audiences than was once possible.
Hal Varian, Google Chief Economist, talks of micro-multinational
companies:
If the late 20th Century was the age of the multinational company, the early
21st will be the age of the micro-multinational: small companies that operate
globally.
(Varian, 2011)8
Varian believes that just as in the 19th century (where the elements were
standardized mechanical parts like wheels and gears) and the 20th century
(internal combustion engines, electronics and, eventually, microchips) we
live now in another era of combinatorial innovation.
8 The digital-native organization
Today, a large proportion of software development and innovation on
the web involves connecting standardized components (including open
source operating systems, servers, database management systems and
languages such as Linux, Apache, MySQL, Python) in new ways. Not only
are the building blocks of innovation readily accessible, but the barriers to
entry have reduced dramatically through improved accessibility to support
infrastructure and systems such as cloud computing, data, business, communication
and content services.
As a consequence the pace of innovation has increased. The smallest
company can access the kind of infrastructure, much of it accessible from a
device in your hand, that was barely available to even the largest companies
15 years ago, compete for best people, work with global talent around the
clock, capitalize on global variation in knowledge, skills and wages:
Innovation has always been stimulated by international trade, and now trade in
knowledge and skills can take place far more easily than ever before.
(Varian, 2011)9
Renowned writer, technologist and the founding executive editor of Wired,
Kevin Kelly talks about how it may feel as though many of the most significant
digital innovations have already been developed over the past 30 years,
yet we have barely begun:
… from our perspective now, the greatest online things of the first half of
this century are all before us. All these miraculous inventions are waiting for
that crazy, no-one-told-me-it-was-impossible visionary to start grabbing the
low-hanging fruit.
(Kelly, 2014)10
With the kind of standardized component and infrastructure access that Hal
Varian talked about, the potential for entrepreneurs, says Kelly, has never
been greater. He describes how there has never been a better time ‘in the
whole history of the world’ to invent something, to start something new.
How there has never been a time:
… with more opportunities, more openings, lower barriers, higher benefit/risk
ratios, better returns, greater upside, than now. Right now, this minute. This is
the time that folks in the future will look back at and say, ‘Oh to have been alive
and well back then!’
(Kelly, 2014)
The phrase ‘unicorns’ has become a label (derived from the investment
and VC community) used to denote startup businesses that are in rapid
The key forces for change 9
growth and that have acquired a valuation in excess of US$1 billion. A
better descriptor perhaps is the ‘full stack startup’,11 originated by internet
entrepreneur and venture capitalist Chris Dixon to describe the new
breed of company that is setting out to disrupt and rewire entire markets.
Except the real disruptors might better be termed ‘full stack stay-ups’ rather
than ‘startups’ owing to their innate ability to generate sustainable growth
through continuous but rapid innovation.
Dixon believes that we are in what he calls the ‘deployment phase’ of the
internet. Technological revolutions, he says, happen in two main phases:
the installation phase and the deployment phase. The early stages of each
revolution are typically characterized by a financial bubble that drives the
installation of the new technology at an irrationally fast rate. The crash that
inevitably follows is, in turn, followed by a recovery and then a protracted
period of productive growth that ‘deploys’ the technology much more
broadly throughout other industries and society as a whole.
If a company develops a new technology that is valuable to an industry,
says Dixon, where once the expectation would be to license or sell the
technology to existing companies in that industry, the new approach is to
build a complete, end-to-end product or service (a ‘full stack’ approach) that
bypasses existing companies:
The most interesting tech companies aren’t trying to sell software to other
companies. They are trying to reshape industries from top to bottom.
(Dixon, 2015)
So Buzzfeed is a media company in the same way that Netflix is a streaming
movie company, or Uber a taxi company, or Tesla a car company. These are
companies that have technology at their core. They can deliver improved
product experience, circumvent cultural resistance to new technologies and
capture a greater portion of the economic benefits.
It is a potent combination. With big ideas, grand ambitions, exceptional
talent, unprecedented access to global markets and lower barriers to entry
than ever before, the potential for disruption and horizontal innovation is
writ large. A rolling survey conducted by CB Insights12 was tracking 169
unicorn companies at time of writing, across sectors as diverse as hardware,
retail, data, fintech, social, transportation, healthcare and media.
But while more renowned unicorns like AirBnB and Uber are visibly
rewiring entire markets, a perhaps less immediately conspicuous but no less
present danger comes from large corporates with broad product and service
portfolios coming under attack from multiple startups. New competitive
threats from young, early stage businesses that utilize disruptive business

models and are empowered by digital to attack individual product areas or
service offerings, threatening to ‘unbundle’13 incumbent businesses.
The shifting nature of advantage
Just about every organization is finding that navigating the ever-changing
environment in which they find themselves is like riding a surfboard on a
choppy sea of uncertainty. Yet for many, their approach to strategy has not
changed.
We need a new kind of strategy for a new world. A strategy that is far
more adaptive than the fixed, inflexible forms of strategy that are still prevalent
in many businesses. A ‘digitally native’ strategy that is more suited to the
fast-changing, technologically empowered markets that we now operate in.
Columbia Business School professor Rita Gunther McGrath (in The End
of Competitive Advantage)14 frames this as a change in the purpose of strategy
from trying to secure sustainable competitive advantage to exploiting
a series of transient competitive advantages that in themselves combine to
form long-term advantage. McGrath based this assertion on research that
looked at companies which had a market cap of over US$1 billion and that
had, over the period 2000–09, sustained a net income growth of 5 per cent
above global GDP. There were only 10 of these companies, but she looked
in detail at the lessons from their strategies.
Drawn from that, McGrath developed a useful framework for a more
agile organizational strategy that echoes many of the themes discussed in
this book:
●● Continuous reconfiguration: moving on from extreme restructuring
programmes to a process of ‘continuous morphing’ that combines core
stability in essentials like corporate vision, while enabling dynamism in
operations, structures and execution. This is empowered through fluidity
in the allocation of talent rather than narrowly defined roles.
●● Healthy disengagement: rather than defending an advantage to the end,
taking a more systematic, frequent, formal approach to disengagement,
and feeding the learnings back into the business.
●● Resource allocation that supports agility: key resources are managed
under central control and not held hostage by local business units,
resources are organized around opportunity rather than opportunities
being squeezed into existing structures, access to assets and leveraging
external capability being key, not necessarily needing to own or build
everything yourself.
The key forces for change 11
●● Innovation proficiency: moving from episodic to continuous and systematic
innovation, protected through governance and budgeting being
separate from business as usual, dedicated resourcing, and a balanced
approach of resource investment across core, growth and entirely new
initiatives. Higher levels of experimentation and learning from failure
encouraged.
●● Leadership: promoting continual shifts with broader constituencies
involved in the strategy process, talent directed towards seizing opportunity,
and rather than seeking perfection, accepting of fast and roughly right.
We are at a watershed moment for organizational strategy. One where
attachment to traditional, deeply ingrained approaches that seek to extract
maximum value from sustainable competitive advantage for as long as
possible, even when that competitive advantage is in decline, is becoming
a significant barrier to progress. One where outmoded, inflexible, slowmoving
systems, strategies and processes that are optimized over time
around sustainable advantages are becoming a liability.
Much of this is not only about enabling companies to be more agile and
flexible, but about moving away from a number of the things that create
a great deal of demoralizing frustration among employees – the inflexible
pursuit of legacy models, an episodic approach to innovation, narrow job
roles, rigid planning processes, post strategic-review downsizing and so on.
Instead, the continuous pursuit of new markets, new technologies, innovation
and improved capability around a focused vision has the potential to be
hugely energizing, motivating and inspiring for employees.
If navigating the current business and consumer environment is like
riding a surfboard on a choppy sea of uncertainty, we need to learn how to
surf the waves of opportunity. McGrath talks about how strategy and innovation
have historically been thought of as two separate disciplines:
Strategy was all about finding a favorable position in a well-defined industry
and then exploiting a long-term competitive advantage. Innovation was about
creating new businesses and was seen as something separate from the business’s
core set of activities.
The disparate fields of organizational change, strategy and innovation are
all coming together, driven by the need for far greater adaptability in order
to win in a world of transient competitive advantage. Every company now
needs to think more like a startup. Today’s digitally native organizations,
for example, are making huge efforts to retain the culture and agility of a
startup as they scale.
12 The digital-native organization
So what does this really mean in terms of organizational strategy? In
June 2014, Boston Consulting Group revisited their classic growth share
matrix. The matrix, originated by BCG founder Bruce Henderson 40 years
ago, famously plots a product portfolio on a 2 × 2 against growth rate and
market share, giving us categorizations like ‘stars’, ‘problem child’ (or ‘question
marks’), ‘dogs’ and ‘cash cows’, and is a key part of business school
teaching on strategy.
Many large organizations have used its principles of mapping company
competitiveness (share) against market attractiveness (growth) as the basis
for investment and resourcing decisions. High share could result in sustainably
superior returns and eventually cost-efficiencies driven by scale and
experience, high growth indicated markets with the greatest leadership
potential.
In the face of rapid change and uncertainty driven by (among other
factors) technological impact, BCG now say that companies need to
‘constantly renew their advantage, increasing the speed at which they shift
resources among products and business units’. In addition, market share
is no longer a direct predictor of sustained performance, with competitive
advantage increasingly coming from other factors such as adaptability.
Their research, which mapped every US listed company to a quadrant
on the matrix, found that companies circulated through the matrix quadrants
faster than in previous years (comparing a five-year period 2008–12
to one from 1988–92). In fact, looking at some of the largest conglomerates,
the average time any business unit spent in a quadrant was less than two
years in 2012 (with only a few exceptionally stable industries seeing fewer
disruptions).
There were also changes in the distribution of companies across the
matrix, and a breakdown in the relationship between relative market share
and sustained competitiveness. Cash cows generated a smaller share of total
profits (25 per cent lower than in 1982), and were proportionately fewer,
with the lifespan of this stage declining (by some 55 per cent in industries
that saw faster matrix circulation).
Unsurprisingly, BCG go on to say that the matrix is still relevant, but needs
to be applied with greater agility and a focus on ‘strategic experimentation’
to allow greater adaptability. This is likely to mean more experimentation in
the question marks quadrant, run more quickly, economically and systematically
in order to identify promising ones that can grow into stars. It is
also likely to mean faster response to cashing out stars, retiring cows and
maximizing what value they can from dogs.
The key forces for change 13
Transformed consumer contexts
The power shift from organizations to consumers, and the greater transparency
and democratization in product and service creation, development, marketing,
sales and operation that has been fuelled by technological empowerment
has brought new and challenging consumer contexts to many businesses.
As digital empowers ever-richer and more seamless interaction, customer
expectations are dramatically increasing. As soon as we are spoiled by a
seamlessly intuitive, smartly designed, on-demand customer experience like
Amazon one-click or Prime, we want and expect everything to be like that.
In their book A Beautiful Constraint,15 Adam Morgan and Mark Barden
neatly describe this phenomenon and the rise in ‘unreasonable’ levels of
consumer expectation as ‘Uber’s Children’.
As more products become services, impatience with even the tiniest
annoyances becomes a brand differentiator and the most exceptional (even
if not directly related) customer experience the benchmark by which everything
else is judged. If I can renew my car tax online so easily, why is it so
cumbersome to change a standing order online with my bank? If I can see
real-time how far my taxi driver is away from me, why am I waiting in at
home not knowing when my package will arrive? If I can navigate seamlessly
to immediately stream on-demand almost any piece of music that I
want, why can’t I do that with all forms of content?
So while service design has become a real differentiator and driver of
advantage, the competitive context for brands has also become far broader,
consumer expectations far more challenging to address, and the advantage
of continually innovating around customer need never greater.
As Adam Morgan has pointed out, the unreasonable consumer is, in
effect, asking businesses questions that challenge and propel brands and
companies to greater heights and changing the face of entire categories in
the process:
… if we don’t ask propelling questions of ourselves, someone is going to ask
them of us, someone with authority and legitimacy. It may be our largest or
most influential customer, or our noisiest challenger, but if we don’t anticipate
this, by the time we hear them we will already be behind the curve. This is the
corollary of the new.
(Morgan, 2015)16
As advantage increasingly resides in customer experience and usability,
those businesses that have long been schooled in great service design and
14 The digital-native organization
that can adapt rapidly to shifting consumer contexts will increasingly show
the way. And as wave after wave of innovation hits customer interfaces
(once desktop, and then mobile, now increasingly those mediated by artificial
intelligence), this, and the market-beating competitive advantage that
will be derived from investment in the smart application of new technologies,
will increasingly separate the great from the simply good.
The ‘gateway principle’ and the customer
interface battle
As technology exponentially advances, so the interfaces that we have with
that technology advances and evolves with it. Ever-more sophisticated
user interfaces enable the potential for more progressive user interaction
and seamless user experience. Put simply, the way in which humans are
interacting with technology, and the expectations that we have in terms of
convenience, capability and ease of use, is shifting at pace alongside the
development of that technology.
So text and keyboards are augmented with touch screens, voice activation,
artificial intelligence, and eventually virtual and augmented reality. As this
advances, it becomes essential for businesses to understand where the value
lies, and how to best optimize for not only rapidly shifting customer interactions
and expectations, but also behaviours. Underlying customer needs may
change less than we think, but the behaviours that surround them and how
we choose to fulfil those needs do change, and is ultimately a very real source
of advantage or disadvantage. So while technology is important, understanding
the underlying behaviours that surround it and how they change is even
more so. As Henry Jenkins (Professor of Communication, Journalism and
Cinematic Arts, University of Southern California) once said: ‘Our focus
should be not on emerging technologies but on emerging cultural practices’.17
Yet alongside the shifts in customer interfaces (and the rapidity of those
shifts) there is another key dynamic which has become more important over
time: who owns that customer interface or at least the data that comes from
customer interaction. While it remains important to optimize for shifting
customer touchpoints the dangers of digital disintermediation are never far
away. Aggregators (like MoneySupermarket or ComparetheMarket) enable
consumers to compare prices more easily but also then become the primary
gateway for that market. Rather than go to multiple insurance providers for
example, it is far easier and more convenient to use a comparison service,
but as a consequence that service becomes the funnel through which customers
are channelled to providers.
The key forces for change 15
Similarly, ubiquitous digital services such as Google, Apple, Facebook
and Amazon (so-called ‘GAFA’) are building ecosystems of digital touchpoints
around users through which we are able to perform all manner of
tasks. Leave a comment on a website? Easily login with Facebook. Find a
restaurant nearby? Voice search on Google. Need a recipe? Ask Siri. Need
that recipe to be read out to you as you cook? Ask Amazon’s Alexa assistant
via their Echo speaker.
The power in being the primary gateway, of course, is more customer
data, which can in turn be leveraged to create more personalized digital
experiences and generate revenue. The customer relationship with the service
provider is now mediated through multiple service ‘layers’, all battling to be
the customer interface.
As our use of smartphones matures, an increasing amount of interaction
happens not direct with apps (where brands can own more of the interaction),
but via search and the notifications layer, at the operating system
level (where Apple or Google own more of the interaction). As GAFA invest
more in AI-driven automation and services like Facebook M (in Messenger),
Google Now, Apple Siri and Amazon Alexa, and these services are embedded
and integrated into an increasing number of third-party applications,
service providers become ever-more mediated.
It is, as Tom Goodwin, memorably describes it, like the ‘thin internet’: a
‘more seamless, more pervasive, personal and even predictive’ (Goodwin,
2014)18 blanket spread thinner in more context specific layers across more
devices. The battle is increasingly for the customer interface,19 with the
balance of power increasingly tilting towards a new breed of company that
derives enormous value from software-driven services that are the gateway,
and mediate between large (more often not owned) supply systems and
consumers. Digital disintermediation is a continuous, ever-shifting danger.
Transformed company contexts
The Data Explosion
The exponential increase in the amount of data generated by the evergrowing
volume of connected devices and services is not new news. Most
organizations are awash with data. In 2010, Eric Schmidt famously described
(at Google’s Atmosphere Convention) how:
There were 5 Exabytes of information created between the dawn of civilization
through 2003, but that much information is now created every 2 days.20
16 The digital-native organization
EMC’s Digital Universe Study in 201421 (using research conducted by
IDC) predicted that with the ever-increasing number of connected people
(believed to be almost 3.5 billion, or 46 per cent of the world population,
at time of writing),22 connected and increasingly smart devices and ‘things’,
the ‘digital universe’ will grow by 40 per cent a year into the next decade,
increasing from 4.4 zetabytes in 2013 to 44 zetabytes in 2020. In 2005, the
digital universe was estimated to comprise ‘only’ 132 exabytes of data.
But the challenge of deriving value from it all remains very real. For all
the talk of ‘Big Data’, most companies are struggling to handle, analyse and
extract potentially valuable insights from the (comparatively small) amount
of data they already have access to. An oft quoted finding from the 2012
EMC/IDC Digital Universe study revealed that less than 1 per cent of the
world’s data is actually analysed.23
Data may well be the new oil, but as one of the interviewees for this book
said: ‘Data is the new oil because it’s toxic unless you refine it’, a reference to
the widely acknowledged originator of the metaphor Clive Humby (Founder
and Chairman of well-known customer science business Dunnhumby) who
described (to the Association of National Advertisers in 2006, written up by
Michael Palmer)24 how:
Data is the new oil. It’s valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. It has
to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc to create a valuable entity that
drives profitable activity; so must data be broken down, analyzed for it to have
value.
Gartner’s model for maturity in data analytics25 sees a progression of value
(and also difficulty) that begins with the basic descriptive analytics (what
happened), moves to diagnostic analytics (in which we understand why it
happened), to predictive analytics (where we can predict what will happen),
and eventually to prescriptive analytics (understanding how we can actually
make it happen).
As simple information moves towards optimization, the opportunity for
greater operational efficiency and benefit increases dramatically.
Everything becoming a service, and software
‘eating the world’
As the internet becomes ever-more pervasive and is integrated into an
increasing number of not just devices but also objects, an increasing number
of products are morphing into services. As more things become connected,
so the potential to augment product experience through service becomes
The key forces for change 17
much greater. So we have the connected car that enables voice-controlled
access to a whole range of new services, the smart thermostat that I can
access and control remotely via my smartphone, the album that is updated
multiple times by the artist even after release.26
Where once products were released into the world and subsequent
improvements would only come from new versions of that same product,
now continuous augmentation, fixes and enhancements can happen in the
same way that our smartphone operating system is continually updated.
As more products become services, the operational requirements on a
business change significantly. Ubiquitous, always-on connection creates
opportunities (and demands) for ongoing improvements and updates.
Ongoing customer interaction generates the potential for enhanced service
delivery through data collection, visualization, personalization and recommendation.
Real-time data acquisition and aggregation allows for near
real-time response, adjustment and adaptation. The product sits at the centre
of a connected ecosystem of touchpoints and interactions, glued together
by data and the single customer view, and blurring real-world with virtual
world experiences.
Writing about the launch of a new Nike+ app, for example, Toby Barnes
(Product Strategy Director at AKQA in Portland) has described27 how transformative
the app is not just to Nike’s customer and product proposition,
but to the business itself:
The app is a sharp point to a service. A service that involves physical stores,
runs clubs, events, knitted products that are created as consumers design
them, content strategies based on physical activities, non linear story telling
and breaking org charts into atoms and networks.
(Barnes, 2016)
The proliferation of services in turn means that service design, adept collection,
analysis and application of data, and seamless, exceptional customer
experience become real product differentiators and sources of advantage.
As that advantage increases, so does the importance, potential and power of
software across just about every product category.
In a prophetic Wall Street Journal article authored in 2011, Marc
Andreesen wrote about how more and more business problems start to
look like software problems and why ‘software is eating the world’.28 As an
increasing number of product areas become surrounded by service propositions,
and an ever-growing number of industries, from travel to logistics,
banking to healthcare, education to consumer packaged goods are remodelled
by software, Marc Andreesen’s prognosis is fast becoming reality.
18 The digital-native organization
As seamless integration of software with hardware and other physical
and real-world product experience becomes ever-more critical to customer
perception and advantage, many businesses across a broad range of sectors
are needing to not only redesign product experiences, technology and
support infrastructure, and operations, but learn a raft of new skills to equip
themselves for a very different world.
From linear to networked dynamics
The digital age has brought with it an unprecedented level of connectedness
at both an individual and an organizational level creating far greater opportunity
for value to be derived less from linear, one-way relationships and
increasingly from networked systems of customers, suppliers and partners,
involving two-way value exchanges.
An increasing number of digital-native businesses are creating platforms
that connect, facilitate and enable value creation and exchange that involve
all parties. Think business models built on peer-to-peer. Or the so-called
‘sharing economy’ in which customers ‘rent’ usage of products rather than
own them, facilitated through digitally enabled communities. Think open
source models and ecosystems of external developers that create value for
themselves but also the business, accessing data through APIs.
Think of networked approaches to supply chain management that now
enable a move away from linear flows of information along the supply
chain to a far more connected system and communication flow between
key suppliers, secondary suppliers, manufacturing, distribution centres and
retail, enabling better decisioning, a heightened level of responsiveness to
change, and real-time visibility to demand, thereby reducing wastage and
latency.
And also think of networks of external or remotely based talent or
services that can be tapped into at short notice. When Nobel economist
Ronald Coase wrote about why companies exist in ‘The Nature of the Firm’
in his classic 1937 economics article,29 he described it as being to make it
easier to coordinate, and lower the cost of, producing goods and services.
Yet digital technologies are unbundling traditional aggregations of value,
enabling a far more distributed approach to sourcing and accessing value,
and reducing the transaction costs of utilizing flexible and scalable talent
and services.
In the same way that technology has rebalanced the power relationship
between companies and their customers, so the advent of ever-more
The key forces for change 19
accessible and more loosely coupled architectures of micro-services (cloudbased
services accessed often through APIs or Application Programming
Interfaces that enable remote access to data and services) is driving a move
away from monolithic software to services that are far more flexible, agile
and scalable. Hugely powerful software and services that were once expensive,
complex and the domain of only those businesses that could invest
heavily, are now accessible to the smallest startup. Powerful data sources
that were once locked behind firewalls can now be accessed to drive new
insights and power new services.
The transition from linear value chains to dynamic, networked ecosystems
where data, information and value more readily flows between
all parties in the system is one of the key business shifts of our time. Yet
networked dynamics require new approaches, new partnerships and new
levels of openness.
If we are to truly capitalize on this trend we need to change our understanding
of how businesses can create and retain value in a digitally
empowered world.
The heightened impact of talent
While having the best staff has always been central to business success, the
whirlwind impact of technology has brought with it a stark amplification in
the importance of talent. The potential for performance divergence between
those companies that can attract and retain the best digital talent and those
that can’t has never been greater. Put simply, it has never been more critical
to have the best people.
Digital technologies have shifted power towards individuals and small
teams within companies who can create dramatic change through the origination
and execution of exceptional ideas. The difference between the great
and the merely good in digital talent increasingly makes the difference
between the outstanding and the also-rans in business.
And yet, as the demand for great digital talent expands, shortages in
talent pools from which businesses can draw have left companies fighting
to fulfill shifting skills requirements. Worse still, acute shortages in specific
areas (notably developers, data and analytics, and content) have generated
intense competition in which the winners win big, and the losers get
very little.
At the same time, the competitive context for digital talent has shifted
rapidly. If you are a large multinational with a stuffy, traditional corporate
20 The digital-native organization
headquarters in the suburbs, you are not only up against other large multinationals
but the cool, funky startup in the trendy part of town. The best
people can be choosy about where they work, the environment in which
they work and learn, and whom they work with and learn from. Increasing
transparency in employer practice and brand means there is nowhere to
hide. The culture and environment into which those people arrive become
critical determining factors for whether you will be able to keep them for
any length of time or attract them to work for you in the first place.
Changing employee expectations means that talented individuals at all
levels, the kind that can really make a difference to wider business performance
and advantage, will only work in the kind of culture and environment
that truly gives them greater freedom and flexibility, a sense of purpose
and empowerment, one that enables them to thrive alongside like-minded
people, and one where they can learn from the best in the industry.
The agile context model
We have created a practical tool for understanding the key questions that
sit at the intersection of the key contexts (competitive, customer, company)
and the attributes of agility (velocity, focus, flexibility). Workshop these
questions, using the canvas in Table 1.1 as a way to identify key areas of
challenge and opportunity:

The key challenge: rates of change
When we begin to consider our response to these not insignificant shifts,
we first need to appreciate the fundamental challenge that sits at the heart
of digital transformation – the variance between the rate of change within
organizations and that which is characteristic of the external environments
in which they operate. Put simply, change within businesses typically
happens at a slower pace than the rate of change in technology and the
consumer behaviour that surrounds it. Too often, companies are playing
catch up with consumers.
Marketing technologist, author and blogger Scott Brinker frames this
dilemma rather neatly (in his thinking around ‘Martec’s Law’),30 describing
this as the ‘quintessential management challenge of the 21st Century’.
Technological change happens exponentially, but organizational change is
dependent on factors that transition far more slowly (attitudes, thinking,
structures, behaviours, culture) and so is logarithmic (Figure 1.2).
The widening gap between these two curves is perhaps the key leadership,
management and organizational challenge of our times. A company’s ability
to absorb, respond and adapt to and master accelerating technological
change is critical to its success in the modern world yet most companies are
simply too slow. Too slow in adapting processes. Too slow in making decisions.
Too slow in reorganizing around opportunity. Too slow in identifying

Stories from the frontline
Gerd Leonhard, Futurist and Author: The Future of Digital Transformation
The term ‘Digital Transformation’ is well on its way to becoming overused,
long before it even has a chance of becoming a reality. It has become
an expression that implies a readiness for the future but which rarely
indicates any profound change in thinking. The kind of changed thinking
necessary to equip today’s corporations for surviving the imminent
transition awaiting humanity as technology becomes truly embodied. The
shifts that this will bring, not only to the world of work but to education,
retirement, our concepts of birth, life and death mean that we must not
only digitally transform, we must transform digitization.
Transforming digitization means that we must reassume the lead
narrative and change technology before it changes us utterly. Digitization
must not become the vehicle to mass layoffs and unemployment, social
contract erosion or cultural collapse and resource wars. Today, we
already exist in a world where a shared economic narrative has almost
disappeared and as humans on a planet with finite resources we must
master technology in ways that we have not yet demonstrated, including
socially, culturally, ethically and environmentally.
The time for treating ethics as a public relations exercise, a nice-tohave
after the economic model has extracted maximum profit, is long
where value lies and innovating to capture that value. There is a paradigm
shift required in the level of organizational agility that most companies are
currently capable of and in the very fabric of how they work. If strategy is
about linking execution and action with purposeful choices and direction,
we need a new kind of corporate strategy. One that is altogether more suited
to a digitally empowered world.
Yet before we even begin on our journey towards becoming a more agile
business, we need to recognize some fundamental truths: to appreciate the
way in which digital disrupts so that we might identify potential dangers
and opportunity and respond before it is too late; to develop a common way
of understanding what digital really means within the business so that we
can execute against a clear vision and provide direction; and to be prepared
to deal with the barriers and blockers that are contributing towards inertia
and preventing change from happening.
The key forces for change 23
gone. We are entering the age of digital ethics. Technology now enables
economic sanctioning of any brand that oversteps the moral mark and as
the world becomes ever-more networked, economic demonstrations of
discontent will become increasingly common.
The talk about digital transformation needs to move beyond the focus
on efficiency and towards wider human progress. We love to talk of
exponential technologies rather than of exponential humanism. Technology
is not just removing the intermediaries in every market, it’s tearing down
the walls between public and private life, between economic survival
and moral thriving. The future is not nirvana, neither is it some kind of
Hollywood dystopia. The future, I’m afraid, is all too human. It will look and
feel like today, only much faster and hyper-connected. It will relentlessly
punish any kind of outdated thinking.
Transformation means difference, not merely improvement. We need
androrithms as much as algorithms – human values of creativity and
empathy that transcend the merely mechanistic. We may be the last
generation in history to live biologically organic lives. Before this bodily
marriage with technology, we should use every remaining minute to evolve
morally as much as we do economically. The next 20 years will change
humanity more than the previous 300 years.

How digital
disrupts
Perhaps it is the transformational role that data is starting to play in the
healthcare industry. Or it is the revolutionizing of mapping and navigation
through user generated input and augmented reality. Or it is the increasing
sophistication of algorithms and different forms of curation in news and
content discovery. Or it is the growing use of automation and artificial intelligence
in customer service. Or it is the role that digitally enabled 3D printing
will increasingly take in the manufacturing and construction industries. It
seems that everywhere we look there is a different nuance to how digital is
driving fundamental shifts in the propositions, revenue sources, costs and
operations across many different industries.
Digital disruption is as broad as it is deep, impacting right across sectors
and organizational functions. So just why and how have digital technologies
disrupted so many businesses and markets so fundamentally?
It was strategy guru Michael Porter who, in his 1985 bestseller
Competitive Advantage: Creating and sustaining superior performance1
originated the concept of value chains to describe what businesses do – a
value chain being a set of activities that a company performs in order to
deliver value to market in the form of a product or service.
An organization is essentially a string of components forming a value
chain welded together by transaction costs. Primary activities (inbound
logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, service) are
set out alongside supporting activities (infrastructure, people, technology,
procurement). A business’s competitive advantage is the sum or the average
of its transaction costs. Companies usually wield large advantages in some
components and are lagging in others, but they are founded on the idea of
a sustainable competitive advantage, focused on continued improvement in
efficiency and standardization as a main ingredient in order to lower transaction
costs in particular components.
If competitive advantage is derived from cost leadership and/or
differentiation, then digital can enable new sources for either or both.
02
26
How digital disrupts 27
As businesses grow, pressure to add in resource and cost and to deliver
ongoing shareholder return may well result in the need to increase
prices. This need may be justified through the optimization of goods and
services. Yet a new digitally empowered competitor entering the market
may only (to use Pareto’s principle) deliver 80 per cent of the value but can
do so at 20 per cent of the cost. When this is combined with a potentially
sector-defining change in customer experience, this creates a significant
disruptive threat.
In his TED talk on ‘How Data Will Transform Business’, Philip Evans,
author and MD of the Boston Consulting Group, argues that with digitization
it may become possible to achieve zero marginal cost in some
components, meaning that the transactional costs plummet to a level where
there is less or nothing to economize on.
Evans argues that when certain components in the value chain plummet
it can change the rules of the game for an entire industry – because it breaks
up both the welding and usually (but not always) the entire value chain
and allows for new competitive advantages and new value chains to take
root – especially if the component that did plummet has been protecting the
industry from outside competition.
… what used to be vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition among
essentially similar kinds of competitors is evolving… from a vertical structure to
a horizontal one… The plummeting of transaction costs weakens the glue that
holds value chains together, and allows them to separate.
(Evans, 2013)2
This is comparable to the theory of disruption where Clayton Christensen
argues that an industry is ripe for disruption when its core technology (or
the component in the value chain that is essential to the nature, protection
or capitalization of the industry) is ‘stretchable’.3
Christensen uses the example of education. A teacher is a technology,
and was not stretchable in 2000, and therefore not ripe for disruption, but
with MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses), a plethora of digital learning
resources available and even Stanford University making course material
available for digital consumption, the shape of education is morphing into
a very different future.
As a succession of markets succumb to digital disintermediation where
incumbent mediators in sectors (media or content businesses, retailers,
brokers to name a few) are challenged, usurped and even replaced or
removed altogether, the scope of digital disruption simply gets wider.
28 The digital-native organization
The lifecycle of a technology
Invention is a lot like surfing; you have to catch the wave at the right time.
Ray Kurzweil
Renowned futurologist (and Google’s Head of Engineering) Ray Kurzweil
has described the lifecycle of a technology (or an invention based on a new
technology) as being shaped as an ‘S-curve’. Kurzweil noted back in 2004
that the pace of innovation is doubling every decade and so he said that
inventions should be aimed at the world of the future, not the world that
exists when your R&D project is launched, since so many contexts change
so rapidly.4 So if technologies follow an S-curve over time (slow, then rapid
adoption and development, before plateauing into maturity) in order to time
an invention properly you need to be aware of the entire lifecycle (Figure 2.1).
Kurzweil describes seven key stages in the evolution of a technology:
1 Precursor: the enabling factors for the new technology are in place (and
visionaries may even be able to describe its goals or its operation), but it
has yet to become a reality.
2 Invention: for which determination and timing are often key.
3 Development: the refining of the invention, which has likely entered the
world as ‘an ungainly and impractical device’.
Adoption/Growth/Performance
Time
Figure 2.1 Lifecycle of an invention
How digital disrupts 29
4 Maturity: this stage often comprises the bulk of a technology’s lifespan.
It has become an integral part of everyday life and probably seems as
though it will never be replaced.
5 False pretenders: assaults on the now established technology from potentially
disruptive newcomers that claim to be in a position to replace it,
and indeed might be better in some ways, but are invariably lacking in
salient, critical features. The failure of the newcomer(s) only leads to a
stronger conviction that the existing technology will survive indefinitely.
6 Obsolescence: further newcomers master the absent qualities, pushing
the older technology into obsolescence.
7 Antiquity: the final resting place.
Kurzweil says that in order to be successful, an invention needs to move
through each phase (precursor, invention, development and maturity),
which reminds us of the Schumpeter definition of the process of technological
change which is divided into three key stages: 1) Invention (ideas); 2)
Innovation (the development of new ideas into marketable products and
processes, or commercialization); 3) Diffusion (scaling or adoption).5 There
are, of course, challenges at each of these stages which are often forgotten
about but worth considering at an organizational level, since we need to be
good at all three of them.
Why businesses get disrupted:
the ambiguity zone
While Ray Kurzweil applied the S-curve to describe the lifecycle of a technology,
it was Charles Handy who (in The Empty Raincoat)6 originally
described how the S-curve is a way of understanding the trajectory of many
successful systems, demonstrating the need for significant and regular reinvention
and change, and how disruption can often happen just when an
existing technology looks like it is performing the best that it ever has. The
duration of specific curves may vary but each one typically begins with an
initial period of learning through trial and error, followed by rapid growth,
and then a plateauing and ultimately decline in performance.
The overlapping of S-curves, caused by the introduction of new technologies
or models into a market is what creates both challenge and opportunity
(Figure 2.2). Many organizations will avoid significant change until crisis is
30 The digital-native organization
reached or disruption is obvious (Point B), which is often too late. By then,
resources may well already be depleted, competitive position already weakened,
leadership credibility already damaged, and energy for new or creative
thinking drained. Starting the change earlier, at Point A, brings challenges
in terms of initiating a period of transition, continuing to optimize the old
while building the new, and managing different and potentially competing
business models, ways of working and/or cultures concurrently. But change
needs to start here. As Charles Handy put it, when you are standing at Point
A you might look back along the curve and see success and growth, but you
can also look forwards over the horizon and see the fall to Point B, so the
trick is look openly at where the trends will lead you, what Point B is telling
you, and use that to help navigate the right path on from Point A and on
to the next curve. So continual reinvention, even when things are seemingly
going well, is the name of the game.
There are two metaphors that are valuable in relation to this. The first
comes from Dave Snowden, who describes the delicate balancing act of
understanding when it is right to focus on the new and stop clinging to the
old as akin to knowing when the moment is right to get in the water:
… it is easier to get in just as the tide turns, you don’t want to be stranded on
the beach, but you want to minimise the energy required to get into the blue
ocean.

How digital disrupts 31
The second comes from Clay Christensen who frames the all-too-frequent
slow organizational response to the need for innovation in this way:
If a company has ignored investing in new businesses until it needs those new
sources of revenue and profits, it’s already too late. It’s like planting saplings
when you decide you need more shade. It’s just not possible for those trees to
grow large enough to create shade overnight. It takes years of patient nurturing
to have any chance of the trees growing tall enough to provide it.
(Christensen, 2012)8
There are not only companies but possibly entire industries that have been
guilty of this. It is one of the key innovation challenges for just about every
business. But as they say in endurance sports, we need to eat before we are
hungry and drink before we are thirsty.
Defining digital
In this context of rapid disruption empowered by digital technologies, it
has never been more important to develop a common language within an
organization for what digital really means.
In fact, this is as good a starting point as any for digital transformation.
Ask a hundred people to define what digital is and you will get a hundred
different responses. Developing a commonly understood definition enables
the business to align around just that – a common understanding. Yet so
few businesses actually do this. Since digital is so broad, touching so many
areas of what we do, and since it blurs traditional boundaries between roles,
functions, departments, categorizations, having a common understanding
forms the basis for not only a shared vision and an inherently more aligned
approach, but also the foundation from which to create change.
Many definitions often focus on aspects such as content, video, mobile,
interaction, scale, ubiquity – in other words on what digital does rather than
what digital is. Yet the simplest possible definition is to characterize digital
in terms of binary code (ones and zeros). A method of getting information
from one place to another that is not analog.
In one sense this is helps us to get past the idea that digital is a mysterious,
amorphous, ever-changing thing that is impossible to grasp, and
instead frames it in the context of taking common needs, wants, actions and
delivering to them or applying them in a new way. Digital technologies are
radically shifting behaviours and reinventing entire markets, but that does
32 The digital-native organization
not mean that we should forget everything we know about great companies,
great products and great brands.
Yet if we are to form a useful, instructive definition we should take
account of more than the technical aspects of digital. It is often the case that
within organizations there is a disproportionate focus on the technology
itself (new technology for the sake of new technology), over all the enablers
that surround the technology, really bring it to life, and fully realize its capability
(people, behaviours, processes, skills, culture).
When the team that drove the initial digital transformation of service
delivery for the UK Government moved to do the same thing at the Co-Op,
they originated a definition that recognized that when done well, digital
means more than fundamentally redesigning services; it also means changing
the way in which we work:
Applying the culture, practices, processes and technologies of the Internet era to
respond to people’s raised expectations.
(Bracken, 2016)9
Creating a single sentence definition for what digital means to your business
creates the platform from which change can be actioned.

What’s stopping
you?
Slow by design
If we are to embark on the journey towards becoming a more agile business,
it is worth pausing to consider some of the key forces for inertia within
organizations and potential blockers to change.
The interviews conducted for this book surfaced a wide range of barriers
to progress, the most commonly cited reflecting technology, strategy and
people related reasons, including:
●● Technology and data: outdated, inflexible systems, creaking IT infrastructure,
difficulty in systems integration and joining up data.
●● Short-termism: a focus on short-term targets and priorities, hampering
the ability to progress with larger, longer-term projects or change.
●● Talent: the challenge of attracting and retaining the best digital talent.
●● Legacy approaches: entrenched behaviours, processes and decisionmaking
that are inherently slow and problematic to unlearn.
●● Organizational silos: the drag brake of internal politics, competing divisional
agendas, siloed decision-making.
●● Prioritization: challenges around understanding how best to allocate
limited resources, often due to lack of knowledge or certainty of impact,
and the ability to show identifiable, short-term gain or benefit.
●● Culture and structure: the inhibiting effect of an organizational culture
that rewards and entrenches behaviours that counteract change, or inflexible
structures that slow progress. Comments included the need to change
culture in order to work smarter and/or faster, or around how structures
are inhibiting, or too much micro management.
Many of these barriers reflect fundamental aspects of organizational
culture and practice. As Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg describe it
in How Google Works, most companies are run today to minimize risk, not
03
34
What’s stopping you? 35
maximize freedom and speed. Information is hoarded, not shared; decisionmaking
power lies in the hands of the few:
Their design is a vestige of an era when failure was expensive, and deliberation
was a virtue.
(Schmidt and Rosenberg, 2014)1
In other words, they are slow by design. If an organization has scaled and
grown utilizing specific, established processes or ways of doing things,
it creates inbuilt inertia that is very hard to counteract. As the company
becomes larger and focus moves more towards efficiency and optimization
rather than breakthrough innovation, the approaches become not only
established but honed and embedded. As hierarchies flourish within the
larger company, and grow up around embedded practices, the inward focus
of the company increases as the outward focus declines. Inertia strengthens
over time.
Why organizations become ‘sticky’
Why do organizations and people become resistant to change? And why
does change seem to become harder the larger the organization gets? One
key reason is that organizational culture becomes entrenched and intransigent
over time, resulting in what Professor Victor Newman describes (in
his book Power House: Strategic knowledge management)2 as the ‘sticky
organization’. If a culture grows up around the problem-solving experiences
and processes associated with a particular kind of technology, then relationships
between people and patterns of behaviour also grow up around that
and can adapt to block change in an effort to maintain social stability.
The relationship capital, or the social capital that has been built up over
time between teams and individuals through the accumulation of reputation,
influence and positive impressions becomes a powerful blocker to change.
As innovation specialist Matt Edgar has said, a startup spends much of its
formative life making and breaking new relationships and links. These are
unpredictable social conditions but ones in which innovation can flourish.
A large organization on the other hand:
… is almost nothing but a massive knot of pre-existing relationships. Getting
something done, even something new, often means following a well-trodden
path to actors already known to each other.
(Edgar, 2013)3
36 The digital-native organization
In this case, the ‘innovation pipeline‘ involves moving concepts from one
predictable stage to another and the only way in which real innovation can
happen in that environment is ‘with the intervention of new actors and the
reconfiguration of old ones’. In order to innovate, therefore, large companies
are required to consciously remain open to new actors or to counter-intuitively
disrupt existing relationships and force the formation of new ones.
In this common scenario, the idea of infallible uniqueness perpetuates
(‘we’re different, so that wouldn’t work here’), and there is a disinclination
to admit failure. Specific ‘craft’ language, or terms and acronyms that
have been developed inside the business as a shorthand way of describing
specific technologies, properties or practices can reinforce the entrenchment
of behaviours that may have become outdated. As Victor Newman says:
Strong cultures continually evolve new behaviours to block change, to maintain
social stability and preserve power structures based upon existing patterns and
accumulated reserves of mutual relationship capital. The greater the relationship
capital in the network, the ‘stickier’ the organization and the stronger its defence
of current structures and knowledge products embedded in the technology
of the organization. The stickier an organization, the more pronounced its
tendency to focus on the problems it can solve, rather than the problem it needs
to solve.
(Newman, 2013)4
Relationship capital is a powerful potential barrier to change since if the
underlying business or technology changes, it also changes the value of the
relationships within the company, which is something that is resisted. The
way in which teams are incentivized or remunerated can amplify this resistance.
Take, for example, the executives who are unwilling to adopt new
practices since they believe it will impact their quarterly bonus. Or the sales
team who are wary of a new piece of technology since it will enable other
teams to immediately see the status of a piece of business. Or the team that
continue with outdated practices even when new technology is implemented
because they feel comfortable with the old way of working.
Entrenched behaviours generate resistance to change, and therefore
inertia, but can also create organizational habits that are often hidden and
unacknowledged yet might be powerful drivers of response and action.
Such habitual thinking and behaviours can not only go unrecognized, but
can prove very difficult to change. The Roman poet Ovid said ‘Nothing
is stronger than a habit’, and he could well be right. A study from Duke
University estimated that habits, rather than conscious decision-making,
shape up to 45 per cent of the choices we make every day.
What’s stopping you? 37
Why good ideas become battles
Many of us have experienced the very real frustration of coming up with
an exceptional idea that we believe self-evidently has great potential value
for our business only to find that those around us do not share our vision,
leaving us with an arduous struggle to build support, create momentum and
garner enthusiasm. A compelling business case, however cogent and persuasive,
may still not be enough to gain acceptance of an idea that seems to you
to be utterly convincing in its attractiveness, simplicity or common sense.
In these situations maintaining confidence in your idea (particularly if it
is a potentially disruptive one) and having the determination to pursue it in
apparent adversity, can be a very real and personal challenge. To paraphrase
Hugh MacLeod,5 good ideas can disrupt the power balance of relationships
within businesses and so are often resisted.
Conformity has its own hidden power. Loss aversion, or the strong preference
most people have towards avoiding losses over acquiring gains (some
studies have suggested that in some contexts losses can psychologically be
up to twice as powerful as gains)6 can be a powerful barrier to progress
when people feel that change threatens existing constructs, relationships or
systems into which they might have invested considerable effort over time.
This results in a risk-averse culture and a biased assessment on potential
gains against visible losses.
Some internal innovation schemes (often little more than idea generating
competitions) can prove far more demotivating than they are galvanizing
when good ideas are dismissed because of internal politics, or because the
person who submitted the idea is perceived not to have the skills to lead the
project, or due to poor feedback mechanisms. There are few more efficient
ways to turn passion and enthusiasm into disappointment and disengagement
than a mishandled idea generation process.
Trying to get a good idea off the starting block in an environment that
feels like it is trying to put as many obstacles as possible in the way of that
happening turns it into a campaign to gain consensus among key decision
makers who were often not party to the origins of the idea and so feel no
ownership of it. Working on new ideas may be additive to workloads, result
in a higher demand on already tight resources, or require constant justification.
As designer Adam Katz once said:7 ‘All of my good ideas are battles’.
But they are always worth it. Famously it took James Dyson five years
and 5,127 prototypes to invent the world’s first bagless vacuum cleaner.8
Resilience propels real innovation. Without it ideas wither and die.
38 The digital-native organization
The arrogance of scale
As companies grow larger it becomes ever-more difficult for them to retain
the right balance between ambition and humility, external curiosity and
inward focus, restlessness and complacency.
Market dominance and scale can easily turn into corporate arrogance
and lack of urgency. The pressures brought by demands for ever-greater
scale and efficiency are a catalyst for internal politics, bureaucracy, managing
upwards and internal focus. Hubris can cause poor listening and analysis,
missed opportunities and kill the ability to reinvent.
The opposite, in other words, of the qualities of organizational longevity
listed by Arie de Geus in his renowned book on The Living Company:9
the ability to learn and adapt from being sensitive to their environment;
to show tolerance for experimentation and different thinking; to retain a
strong, cohesive sense of identity; to be adept at managing resources to
enable flexibility.
A comprehensive study by the Telfer School of Management at the
University of Ottawa10 into the implosion of Canadian telecoms giant
Nortel gives us some stark lessons. The researchers interviewed 48 per cent
of all the Nortel executives who were in charge of the company from 1997
through to 2009 when it filed for bankruptcy, and spoke to executives at 53
different companies that were customers of Nortel in that time. In spite of
the rapidity of Nortel’s decline, they found that corporate failure is a long
and complicated process dependent on multiple accumulating factors. When
asked about Nortel’s biggest management failure however, the study’s lead
author, Jonathan Calof, said:
There were three major factors that caused the failure. When Nortel was
a market leader in the ’70s, it developed an arrogant culture, which led to
poor financial discipline. Then in the ’90s, it focused so intensely on growth
that it broke its ability to innovate and read the market. And after the tech
bubble popped, it turned inward and cut costs to the point where it alienated
customers.
(Calof, 2014)11
Arrogance, pursuing growth at all costs, efficiency at the expense of
innovation. Many of these problems were seemingly originating from
a culture that became baked into the company long before it was in
trouble, and served to reinforce the kind of toxic assumptions we talk
about in the next section. Assumptions that damaged the business and
What’s stopping you? 39
brought focus away from where it needed to be and created an internally
facing company. Says Calof:
It escalated into hubris to the extent of making it especially difficult to absorb
acquisitions, to quickly respond to market needs, and to accept and understand
what customers wanted (largely as result of the delusion of ‘we know better’).
As businesses become leaders in their market it is very easy for them to
become blinded by conceit: for the language of leadership to slip into
the language of arrogance. As they become overly focused on growth it
is very easy for them to become parochial and lose sight of what really
matters. As they pursue efficiency gain over forward thinking it is very easy
for them to become internally focused, for informal reward systems (such
senior management attention and recognition) to subtly put a premium on
inward-looking management. The potential for rapid disruption that digital
has brought to so many markets serves only to amplify the impact of such
misaligned corporate culture.
Protecting against obsolete beliefs
and ‘toxic assumptions’
Legacy systems, processes, and approaches often have their own assumptions
on which they were originally based that then become embedded in
ways of working and thinking without us even acknowledging that they
exist. They may be assumptions about competitive or partner context,
resources, customer needs, channels, market size or positioning, but they are
fundamental, hidden, ingrained.
Let’s call them ‘toxic assumptions’. They are the most dangerous kind
of assumptions because despite being unnoticed, they become entrenched
over time and they are powerful drivers of thinking and inertia. They will
go unchallenged yet are typically based on a view of the world that relies
on historical or existing market, model or competitive dynamics. As soon as
those dynamics change, potentially in unforeseen ways, the business is underprepared
and struggles to adapt. When people in the organization say things
like ‘that wouldn’t work here’, or ‘we tried something like that a few years
ago and it didn’t work’ or ‘we’ve always done it like that’, these are signals
that you have some beliefs or assumptions that are potentially obsolete.
So how do we protect ourselves from toxic assumptions? The answer, of
course, is that we need to be continually reassessing our beliefs and our view
40 The digital-native organization
on the world in light of the ever-changing environment in which our companies
operate. Paul Graham, essayist, VC, and founder of startup incubator
Y Combinator, has written about how in order to respond well to a rapidly
changing world, we need not only to have an explicit belief in change (in
other words to be actively looking for change) but also to be ‘aggressively
open-minded’. In a static environment, the confidence we have in our beliefs
increases over time as they survive more and increasingly varied experiences,
and are therefore reinforced and less likely to change. The same is true
of our opinions. But when it comes to things that continually change, we
cannot trust our opinions in the same way. Beliefs become obsolete because
the frame of reference on which they were based has changed:
When experts are wrong, it’s often because they’re experts on an earlier version
of the world.
(Graham, 2014)12
So it is with inflexible, outdated thinking within organizations. Having
an explicit belief in an ever-changing environment means that rather than
regarding the world as static you start to actively look for change. Focusing
on aspects of a market, customer interaction or situation that don’t change
(like human nature, our desire for convenience, and exceptional user experience)
can be an important source for innovation, but it is just as important
to understand when key dynamics are shifting and, as Graham says, meaningful
change often originates from unforeseen places meaning that our
view on the world can easily and quickly become outdated.
Until very recently the organization was moving faster than the consumer,
the world was more predictable and consumers were informed and listened,
but now the consumer is moving faster than the organization, they no longer
wait to be told, but can make so many decisions on the fly about so many
aspects of their life. Organizations consist of consumers but we rarely look
at ourselves in this way. We go to work and the technology we use internally
is often less advanced than the technology we use at home or on the
way to work. Only recently has ‘bring your own device’ (BYOD) become
more acceptable within organizations, reflecting the need for companies to
become employee-centric as much as they are customer-centric, in order to
maintain the connection with the real world outside.
So this means that we must be disciplined about not letting our working
hypotheses or domain-expertise overly constrain our view on the future.
Becoming an expert in a changing world means that it is essential to not just
look for change, but to always be ready to flex your thinking in response to
it, and avoid becoming imprisoned by your own proficiency. If knowledge
What’s stopping you? 41
is power, then change can easily threaten inflexible domain-expertise, leading
to entrenched beliefs and even greater inflexibility. Being what Graham
describes as ‘aggressively open-minded’ means always being ready to challenge
our existing beliefs in response to new information or ideas:
Within Y Combinator, when an idea is described as crazy, it’s a compliment – in
fact, on average probably a higher compliment than when an idea is described
as good.
(Graham, 2014)13
In a shifting environment we need to recognize that strength and growth
in knowledge comes from adaptability. There is a final point that Graham
makes, which is about people. When the future is hard to predict it becomes
just as, if not more, important to focus on the people rather than the ideas as
a way of protecting against obsolete beliefs. Great ideas come from enthusiastic,
earnest, independent-minded people, so:
Surround yourself with the sort of people new ideas come from. If you want to
notice quickly when your beliefs become obsolete, you can’t do better than to be
friends with the people whose discoveries will make them so.
(Graham, 2014)14
The tyranny of rigid planning
Later in the book we will discuss fundamentally more agile approaches to
planning that take far more account of the rapidly changing (or as it is often
called VUCA: Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) environment in
which businesses now operate. But it is worth remembering the restrictive,
inhibiting power of traditional, rigid planning techniques.
A typical, linear, business planning process is not the most motivating of
experiences, as marketer and cartoonist Tom Fishburne has neatly described:
Crafting an annual plan is like getting a bill through Congress. Behind the final
numbers and strategies lie countless hours of spreadsheet crunching, hallway
meetings, and waterfall charts. We debate assumptions, broker compromises,
and eventually settle on a plan that is wrong the moment it’s inked.
(Fishburne, 2013)15
There are some significant potential flaws that sit at its heart:
●● The predicted outcome will be wrong. Let’s face it, in the environment in
which we now operate no one can predict what will happen in the next
42 The digital-native organization
month let alone the next year, or five years. In their book, Rework,16
Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson talk about why we should
start referring to plans as what they really are – guesses. Start referring
to business plans as business guesses, financial plans as financial guesses
and strategic plans as strategic guesses, and stuff becomes a whole lot
simpler. Plans become objectives, so if your predicted outcome is wrong,
your objective is already flawed.
●● The assumptions on which the plan is built are wrong. Most plans use
the previous year’s numbers as the basis for the forecast of the following
year’s numbers (and often those beyond). Last year’s numbers, which
were the result of last year’s competitive context, consumer demand and
behaviour. All of which (you can guarantee) will be very different a year
later. Planning is typically done part way through the year and so the
numbers you finally finish the year on are inevitably different from those
that formed the basis of your plan. So your year-on-year variable starts to
look either gloriously easy or (more likely) increasingly unreachable and
unrealistic as the year goes on. Either way, the basis for the plan is flawed.
●● Plans ‘let the past drive the future’. Business planning, as does much
‘management thinking’, favours inductive thinking (based on directly
observable facts) and deductive thinking (logic and analysis, typically
based on past evidence). It is how we are taught at business school, and
often the basis of reward when we start in gainful employment. And it
is the kind of thinking with which business process is most comfortable.
Abductive thinking (of the kind emphasized in design, imagining what
could be possible) on the other hand, is not. Many businesses are characterized
by processes that are convergent (focused on making choices,
closing down on a solution), rather than divergent (focused on creating
choices, opening up options). Making big decisions based on contexts
that are no longer relevant or information that will soon be out of date
is flawed.
●● It perpetuates incremental thinking. The context for most plans is the
percentile variable from the previous year. Usually it is an increase of
somewhere between 0 and 10 per cent. The criteria for success is set
at doing-what-you-did-before-but-slightly-better. This focuses the mind
on driving incremental gain through incremental benefit or efficiencies.
When entire industries are being reinvented, this kind of approach in
isolation breeds complacency and in complacency sits risk.
●● Detailed, rigid plans are the enemy of adaptability. The more fixed and
detailed your plan is, the harder you have to work to do something outside it.
What’s stopping you? 43
The harder it is to improvise; the higher the cost of change. The more difficult
it is to budget to the pace of innovation, rather than innovate to the
cycle of your budget. As circumstance changes (as it inevitably will), plans
are revised, reworked, re-justified. Revisions and justifications are focused
on the differential from the first plan (which was fundamentally flawed in
the first place) making for an unhelpful comparison. Managers spend time
generating reports and attending meetings to justify why the original plan
(which was fundamentally flawed in the first place) is no longer relevant.
A not insignificant amount of management time is spent on over-complex
and over-burdening planning processes. It kills morale and it kills time that
could be spent on ideas that will genuinely move the business forward.
The legacy technology problem
Legacy technologies and the processes that surround them can be another
powerful blocker to change. A good example of this was demonstrated relatively
recently in the banking sector, an area where you would think that
advanced modern technology infrastructure could not be more essential. In
2013 a systems outage meant that for three hours on one of the busiest online
shopping days of the year, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) customers could
not access their bank accounts. This followed catastrophic system problems
in 2012, which for a number of days affected 16 million customers’ ability
to withdraw cash from ATMs, transactions on their accounts, handling of
wages and direct debit payments. The RBS Chief Executive admitted at the
time:17 ‘For decades, RBS failed to invest properly in its systems.’
Frances Coppola, a former RBS employee and an independent analyst,
wrote an analysis18 talking about the legacy systems problem that besets the
banking sector. Technology investment, she says, has traditionally been focused
on building front-end applications, meaning that the core systems that run the
basic banking processes have not been upgraded. So in spite of the huge increase
in processing power and storage capacity in modern IT systems, banks like RBS
still had massive traditional mainframe computing systems at their heart.
The thing that prevents these old systems being replaced outright, she
says, is their sheer size, complexity and criticality. Over time, the huge cost
and risk involved in replacing them has meant that these organizations have
adopted a system of ‘wrapping’ – effectively treating the core legacy system
as a black box which remains largely untouched while a ‘shell’ of additional
applications that create customer interfaces, point-of-sale functionality,
44 The digital-native organization
settlement processing and even real-time updates are created around it.
These newer applications rely heavily on the information contained within
the core system but over time build complexity upon complexity as the ‘shell’
gets larger, issues of technological compatibility and connectivity have to be
worked through, and customers rely on them more and more.
This means that there may well be divergence in the financial information
presented to customers and that which appears to the bank (before reconciliation
occurs), the potential for system errors and data corruption grows,
and the risk of significant failure just increases over time:
The more fragmented your systems architecture, and the more it relies upon
stable interconnections between different technologies, the riskier it becomes…
the ‘pasta rule’ still applies: the more your systems architecture looks like
spaghetti, the higher risk it will be.
(Coppola, 2013)19
A significant reason for consistent underinvestment, says Coppola, is that
investment in infrastructure is likely to impact short-term profits and yet
it is not the most interesting type of expenditure. So while balance sheet
risk may have been reduced, operational risk hasn’t. Banks that are focused
instead on rapid expansion have the very real potential of building up a
patchwork of incompatible technologies, and failing to invest in suitable
time or resources for systems support or proper integration. As long as it
keeps on running, as long as it is easier to patch it up or build a workaround,
the longer it goes on, the more complex the interdependencies become, and
the risk and the associated costs build.
In the case of huge banking systems the risks can elevate to levels that
have implications for the whole economy, but this kind of legacy systems
issue is not confined to the banking sector. It can often be regarded as one
of the most significant barriers to making companies fit for purpose for the
modern digital world. And it is not just about the technology, of course, but
the policies, practices, skills and behaviours that surround it. The consequences
of an overly short-term focus on profits may be far greater than is
visible to those looking in from the outside.
Marginal thinking
The safest road to Hell is the gradual one – the gentle slope, soft underfoot,
without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.
C S Lewis
What’s stopping you? 45
How do we avoid the trap of incremental approaches and mindsets? Or the
danger of what Clay Christensen (in How Will You Measure Your Life?)20
calls marginal thinking? An executive in an established company, says
Christensen, will have two alternatives when making an investment decision –
either to incur the full cost of setting up something completely new, or to
leverage what already exists so that you only need to incur the marginal
cost and revenue. The marginal-cost argument will almost always outweigh
the full-cost one. But for a new entrant in the market the only choice is the
full-cost alternative (‘Because they are new to the scene, in fact, the full cost
is the marginal cost’).
The problem with marginal thinking however, is that it typically comes
with lots of baggage. The established company is basing the investment decision
on the perspective of its existing operations and may decide not to invest
if the marginal upside is not worth the marginal cost of doing it. The trap with
this, however, is that while it is easy to see immediate costs of investing, it is
much harder to accurately see the costs of not investing. While the company
still has a perfectly acceptable existing product, the upside of investment may
well be considered too small, but this assumes things will remain as they are
and fails to take into account a future in which someone else brings the new
product to market. This can lead to a series of relatively minor investment
decisions, the consequences of which may not become apparent for some
time but which ultimately and in totality may doom the company to failure.
Culture and behaviour
As we mentioned earlier in the book, while technology is important, the
behaviours that surround it are a fundamental component of change and
agility. Successfully transitioning to an organizational state that is far more
characterized by fluidity, adaptability and constant change depends heavily
on the skills, attitudes and behaviours of the people in your business.
Becoming a truly agile, digital-native business will mean adopting not just
new technologies, but new customer-centric thinking and approaches. It will
mean embracing and responding to new processes and expectations. And it
may well mean adapting to new structures, incentives and responsibilities.
Change requires clarity and leadership to create the environment in
which it can happen, to demonstrate why change is necessary and to direct
and guide behaviour in the right direction, but culture and behaviour are
inextricably linked. Just as culture helps determines behaviour, behaviour
helps shape culture.
46 The digital-native organization
So just as entrenched culture and behaviour can be one of the most
powerful barriers to progress, so an enabling culture and new practices and
behaviours can be powerful forces of advancement towards a more agile business.
Digital transformation is less about ‘talking the talk’, and more about
‘walking the walk’. It is not about jargon, it is about action. As digital literacy
grows at all levels of the organization, beyond the more tangible metrics and
results it will be the expectations that are set, the questions that are asked, the
questions that are not asked, and the visible behaviours of the senior leadership
down, that will be critical indicators that progress is being made.
Stories from the frontline
Faris Yakob, co-founder, strategy and innovation consultancy Genius
Steals, author of Paid Attention:21 Everyone likes progress, no one likes
change
The world pulses to an exponential beat, daring companies to keep up, as
Jack Welch so famously feared. And rightly so, since most companies will
fail to and will die.
That means more and more companies are failing to adapt to the
exogenous changes that either power or destroy businesses.
Why? Why is corporate change so hard?
Some answers are obvious, the well worn territory of The Innovator’s
Dilemma, but others are less well explored and just as important. In our
consulting work, we have uncovered the same barriers, again and again,
at very different kinds of companies.
Formal
Legacy infrastructure, built in an industrial age, represents a massive cost
base in labour, equipment which is being amortized, software, systems
and so on. Public companies cannot abandon them and take the mark
down, their Wall Street owners would never allow it. So they must simply
continue, cutting costs, to prop up share prices. Processes, once codified,
become orthodoxies instead of guidelines.
Worse, should the problem these companies solve melt away through
new technologies, they will be forced to attempt the even more difficult
task of halting progress at a political and cultural level.
The ‘Shirky Principle’: ‘Institutions will try to preserve the problem to
which they are the solution.’
What’s stopping you? 47
Informal
Companies often hire ‘change agents’ to usher in new ideas, products
and processes. This is a death sentence, for it sets up said harbingers
of the future in opposition to every other employee. Implicit in naming
change agents is the idea that change is needed and that no current
employee is bringing it. This oppositional stance makes collaboration nigh
impossible.
Perverse incentives are rife in corporations. At the board level there
is a desperate appetite for growth, which often means change, but
the way it’s pushed through the system creates inverted incentives.
Ridiculous sales targets turned Wells Fargo employees into criminals,
destroying the bank’s reputation. Both the targets and the employees
have been removed.
I spent weeks working on a business and communication strategy
for one of the world’s largest telecoms companies. Our approach was
to simplify the purchase process and migrate it online. Within the
recommendation was a call to close many of the call centres taking sales
calls (which the company had in every state in America) which would have
saved millions of dollars by itself. The clients loved the work in the meeting –
and subsequently killed it. Turned out one of the bosses’ bonuses was
based on call volume, as a proxy for leads.
Goodhart’s Law (named after economist Charles Goodhart): ‘When a
measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.’
Conformal
Ideas can come from anywhere, says every CEO. At least in public. But
there is a window of acceptable ideas that conform to expectations, and
ideas that fall outside them are ignored.
Overton Window (also known as the ‘Window of discourse’): the range
of ideas the public will accept also operates inside companies, as a barrier
to innovation.
The key to addressing barriers is correctly identifying them, which
is usually impossible inside the system, since anyone working at the
company is at the mercy of informal and conformal ones. Companies that
can’t work with partners are unlikely to see the end of the broken bridge
until it’s too late.

Defining digital
transformation
So how might we best define exactly what digital transformation is? We
must first acknowledge three foundational truths:
1 Digital transformation is inevitable. Change is happening whether you
like it or not. You can either choose to respond or get left in its wake.
2 Digital transformation is about more than technology. As we will discuss
at length in this book, it is also about strategy, process, culture, behaviours
and people
3 Digital transformation involves fundamental and comprehensive change.
It is the reinvention of the way in which a company operates. Clay
Christensen has a useful way of framing an organization’s capabilities
(what it can and cannot do), defining three broad areas:1 a) Resources
(tangible ones like buildings and headcount, intangible ones like brands
and IP); b) Priorities (the consensus on what’s right to do, the values, and
the strategy; c) Processes (the formal or informal way in which the work
gets done). This is useful since, as Christensen says, these aspects are
mutually exclusive in that a part of a business cannot fit into more than
one of the categories, but are also collectively exhaustive (put together
the three categories account for everything inside of the business). So
digital transformation is fundamental in all three of these areas.
In 2014, digital and business consultancy Altimeter defined digital transformation
as:2
the realignment of, or new investment in, technology and business models to
more effectively engage digital customers at every touchpoint in the customer
experience lifecycle.
This definition acknowledges the shift required in not only technology but
also business models and customer experience. Yet it perhaps does not
emphasize enough the changes to processes, ways of working and culture.
04
50
Defining digital transformation 51
So, bearing in mind Clay Christensen’s way of summarizing the entire
capabilities of an organization, this is our way of capturing a one sentence
definition:
The transformation and reinvention of the resources, priorities and processes
of a company in order to be fit for purpose in a digitally empowered world.
What digital transformation is NOT
Digital transformation is not simply chasing shiny new technology. There is
a salutary lesson contained in research conducted by Cap Gemini and MIT
Sloan. The study (The Digital Advantage: How digital leaders outperform
their peers in every industry)3 looked at more than 400 large companies over
a two-year period to assess the impact of digital technologies and how those
companies were responding to those challenges.
The study found that while most companies were active with digital
initiatives, only a few had positioned themselves to capture real business
benefit. A combination of two separate but related dimensions combined to
contribute toward digital maturity: digital intensity was defined as investment
in technology enabled initiatives to change how the company operates
(including customer engagements, internal operations, business models);
transformation management intensity was about creating the leadership
capabilities to drive digital transformation (including the vision, governance,
engagement in the process of change, IT or business relationships to
empower it). These two dimensions mapped out four different types of digital
maturity on a two-by-two matrix:
1 Beginners: organizations that do very little with advanced digital capabilities,
have a low awareness of opportunities.
2 Conservatives: companies that favour prudence over innovation, have a
unified vision but are sceptical of the value of digital trends.
3 Fashionistas: follow digital trends and implement shiny new digital apps,
but do not have a unified vision for the digital transformation of their
business.
4 Digirati: those that truly understand how to drive value through the digital
transformation of their business. In other words combining transformative
vision and governance with investment, innovation and continuous
improvement in people, process and technology.
52 The digital-native organization
These more digitally mature companies (or ‘digirati’) were able to combine
a focus on change through new technology, with a concurrent focus on
change management, people, process and culture. The study found that this
latter group of companies were, on average, 26 per cent more profitable,
had a 12 per cent higher market capitalization, and derived 9 per cent more
revenue from existing assets.
This was an advantage that persisted across different industries. But what
was also notable in the research was how companies that pursued shiny new
technologies without the underlying strategies, processes, team structures
and cultures to exploit it (the ‘fashionistas’) effectively damaged their business
performance and were 11 per cent less profitable than the average.
The overarching lesson of the research is that digital transformation
drives real advantage but pursuing shiny new technology (‘the digital
magpie syndrome’) without focusing on all the supporting behaviours,
skills, culture, vision and leadership is bad for business.
What good looks like: a maturity model
for change
So that we might better represent and summarize many of the key shifts
that we will be talking about in the coming chapters, we have developed a
maturity model for what good looks like. This model describes three key
stages of development:
1 Legacy: the state before a business has begun their journey toward digital
transformation, wherein traditional thinking and approaches still dominate.
2 Enabled: the business is in the midst of the journey, and has likely adopted
many of the foundational shifts in mindset, strategy, process, resources
and culture, but there is still work to do to fully embed, extend and realize
the full potential value of these new elements.
3 Native: the business is native to the fluid, rapidly changing environment
in which it operates, and this is reflected right across the organization in
the fabric of its culture and how it operates.
It is important to note that we are not describing a transition with a beginning,
middle and an end. Rather, that the transition is one to an organization
that is able to operate within a constant state of flux, continuously adapting
to new challenges and opportunities that arise. In order to provide some
structure to the model, we have delineated levels of maturity across multiple
Defining digital transformation 53
aspects including customers (orientation of the business), planning and
processes, resources, strategy, vision and culture.
Customers
●● Legacy – multichannel, not omnichannel, company orients around efficiency
rather than customer need.
●● Enabled – organization orients around customer need, joined up processes
and data create coherent, consistent, high-quality customer experience.
●● Native – seamless, rapid customer feedback loops inform strategies,
tactics, innovation and continuous improvement.
Planning and processes
●● Legacy – rigid waterfall processes, rigid approaches to planning, waterfall
project management, infrequent release cycle, control centralized.
●● Enabled – agile development, SCRUM, test and learn, deployment of
rapid prototyping and build, operations empowered by digital, strong
governance, measurement frameworks.
●● Native – interdisciplinary agility, cross-functional, small, nimble teams,
embracing of uncertainty, permission to fail, rapid test and learn embedded
throughout, lean methodologies, embedded digital operations,
data-driven and adaptive processes.
Resources
●● Legacy – siloed data sources, basic analysis tools, descriptive analytics,
technology restricts, legacy platforms, isolated knowledge, vertical skillsets,
poor training, organizational structures oriented around functional
siloes, rigid structures that do not adapt to opportunity.
●● Enabled – software-as-a-service, integrated technology stack, flexible
partnerships, joining up data, basic modelling, predictive analytics, digital
centre of excellence, specialists and generalists, tech skills, more fluid
structures, collaborative environment, integrated digital and online/offline.
●● Native – structures and resourcing oriented around the customer,
continuous reconfiguration of resourcing, flexible, adaptive structures,
organizing around opportunity, joined-up data/tech, prescriptive analytics,
empowered frontline staff, customized dashboards, scalability of the
cloud, actionable modelling, real-time decisions, T-shaped, deep knowledge,
human layer over tech, fluid flow of knowledge.
54 The digital-native organization
Strategy
●● Legacy – digital capability development not central to organizational
strategy/KPIs, clinging to legacy advantage, episodic innovation, shortterm
view.
●● Enabled – systematically designed innovation process, more fluidity to
strategy and planning, innovation accounting.
●● Native – fully agile and adaptive strategy, systematic and embedded
experimentation, healthy disengagement from legacy advantage, longterm
view.
Vision
●● Legacy – assumes retention of existing advantage, lack of clarity around
organizational direction or purpose on the ground.
●● Enabled – compelling vision and strategy, strong link between vision and
organizational priorities/KPIs, rigid execution of vision.
●● Native – clear organizational purpose and vision lived through leadership
and operations, evident in explicit tactics and implicit behaviours, adaptive
execution of vision.
Culture
●● Legacy – precise, slow, controlling, restrictive, focused on efficiency, incremental
improvement, highly discursive.
●● Enabled – collaborative, customer-centric, data-driven, focus on talent,
challenging norms, ownership mindset, greater autonomy, learning from
failures as well as successes.
●● Native – highly fluid/collaborative, agile culture, ‘fast and roughly right’,
entrepreneurial, empowered teams, distributed authority, bias to action,
10X thinking, networked, embedded learning culture.
The agile formula
With comprehensive change requiring a comprehensive response, our definition
of organizational agility incorporates three key foundational elements:
1 Velocity: heightened pace and progression through broad and proficient
adoption and application of digital-native processes including design
Defining digital transformation 55
thinking, agile and lean, continuous experimentation and a culture that
supports constant testing and learning, coupled with an exhaustive,
customer-centric innovation process that enables rapid origination, validation
and commercialization of ideas.
2 Focus: building organizational momentum through an enabling, agile
and adaptive strategy with strong links to execution, and aligned to a
curious, outwardly looking perspective and a clear vision and purpose.
3 Flexibility: creating the culture, environment and structures to move fast
through agile structures and small, multi-disciplinary teams, greater agility
in decision-making and governance, productive and collaborative
environments and an empowering and engaging culture characterized by
autonomy, mastery and purpose.
Each of the elements is essential in becoming truly agile. Without velocity
we lack momentum, without focus we lack direction and governance,
without flexibility we lack the enabling environment necessary for success
(Figure 4.1).
We will take each of these elements in turn in this book to help set out
the structure and logic of our arguments. Since these foundational elements
are not mutually exclusive, but are combinatorial in expounding the essential
components of change, we can represent our formula for the agile
business as:
Agility = (Velocity × Focus × Flexibility)
Each Part of this book will incorporate a series of short discourses that build
to form a blueprint for change, and in the final section we will bring these
elements together to form a roadmap to becoming an agile business.

Part two
Velocity
In this Part, we focus on how to apply digital-native thinking and processes
to build organizational velocity and momentum.
Defining velocity
Velocity – Rapidity of motion or operation; swiftness; speed; tempo; the rate
with which something happens; action and reaction; heightened pace and
progression towards a specific direction of change.
How should we think about velocity in the context of organizational agility?
The best framework for understanding this comes not from a business
consultant but from a military strategist. Colonel John Boyd was arguably
not only one of the best fighter pilots that the United States Air Force has
seen, but went on to became perhaps one of the best military strategists of
all time. He was a maverick who fought multiple battles with Pentagon and
military hierarchy in order to promote the application of his theories and
ideas.
In the 1960s he worked with mathematician Thomas Christie to originate
the Energy-Maneuverability (EM) theory of aerial combat which incorporated
elements such as thrust, weight, drag and velocity into a formula
that could be used to model the performance and combat capabilities of
existing aircraft and even potential new fighter designs. The theory revolutionized
how fighter aircraft were designed and evaluated. At the time, an
ingrained design bias among the USAF hierarchy towards ‘Bigger-Higher-
Faster-Farther’ meant that the US Air Force was consistently building larger,
heavier, multifunctional fighter aircraft with significant technical complexity.
Boyd was able to use his EM theory to show that US fighters faced
the very real prospect of being convincingly outmanoeuvred in combat by
Soviet MiGs. Instead, he and his collaborators (the so-called ‘fighter mafia’
57
58 Velocity
who operated inside the Pentagon but challenged conventional thinking
and therefore authority) championed a new lightweight fighter concept that
would eventually become the renowned F16 jet fighter.
The impact of Boyd’s prescient theories has reached far beyond military
strategy, and his ideas now have a sharp resonance and relevance to the
modern world of business. His maxim that technology must serve its larger
purpose (‘People, ideas, hardware – in that order.’) has never been more true.
When Boyd taught the Marines about his new form of warfare he preached
that in battle there are always several ways to solve a problem so never to
commit rigidly to just a single solution.
One of Boyd’s most famous intellectual legacies is the OODA (Observation,
Orientation, Decision, Action) loop, a decision-loop model designed to illustrate
responses to an event.
In his biography of Boyd (Boyd: The fighter pilot who changed the art
of war),1 Robert Coram details how the maverick colonel, who served in
the Korean War, was inspired by the success rate that American F86 Sabre
fighters had achieved over the Russian built MiG15 jet in the skies over
North Korea (some sources peg this as an overall ‘kill ratio’ of around 6
MiG-15s destroyed for every F86 lost). When Boyd looked into the reasons
behind situations where F86s had performed in a superior way to the MiGs,
he realized that rather than this advantage coming from the F86s being
faster or more heavily armed than their opposition, it was derived from their
ability to manoeuvre and respond more rapidly to swiftly changing battle
conditions.
This insight, and his work on EM theory, led to Boyd developing ideas
around how success and victory in rapidly changing environments (such as
the battlefield) comes from the ability to make smart decisions in response
to dynamic situations more quickly than your opponent. The OODA loop
breaks down the decision cycle into four constituent parts:
1 Observation – through collection of data and information.
2 Orientation – forming a mental perspective using analysis and synthesis.
The former breaks down data or information into components that
allow for deductions that lead to understanding. The latter takes (sometimes
unrelated) components and recombines them to form a new whole.
Analysis, Boyd said, can lead to understanding but not to creativity.
3 Decision – based on your current mental perspective, the determination
of a course of action.
4 Action – the resultant activity informed by the decisions.
Defining velocity 59
Boyd believed that all intelligent organizations and organisms undergo a
continuous cycle of interaction with their environment in this way, thereby
enabling adaptation, but also that a key advantage can be derived not only
through making smarter decisions, but by responding faster to changing
situations. In describing the OODA loop, Harry Hillaker (who worked with
Boyd as the Chief Designer of the lightweight F16 fighter) said:
Time is the dominant parameter. The pilot who goes through the OODA cycle
in the shortest time prevails because his opponent is caught responding to
situations that have already changed.2
Boyd’s thinking effectively became the intellectual kernel for a whole new
approach to warfare for the American military that favoured greater agility
over scale and sheer power. It enabled a move away from hundreds of
years of linear, attritional warfare strategy, and it also came to be applied in
multiple contexts to support business and learning objectives.
But the devil (and the true lesson for becoming an agile business) is in
the detail. Rather than being thought of as a simple one-dimensional cycle
where the advantage comes from being able to progress through the cycle at
the fastest rate possible, the real power in the OODA loop comes from the
ability to use the explicit and implicit knowledge and abilities of those on
the frontline to create significant advantage through responsiveness, and to
create confusion and disorientation among your opponent by using speed
and agility to get into their decision cycle so that they are making decisions
based on less up-to-date or relevant information. As Robert Coram
describes it in the Boyd biography:
Thinking about operating at a quicker tempo – not just moving faster – than
the adversary was a new concept in waging war. Generating a rapidly changing
environment – that is, engaging in activity that is so quick it is disorienting and
appears uncertain or ambiguous to the enemy – inhibits the adversary’s ability
to adapt and causes confusion and disorder that, in turn, causes an adversary to
overreact or underreact.
(Coram, 2003)3
Thus, rather than being simply about speed, it is all about tempo and
manoeuvrability. As the tempo increases the officers on the ground can
bypass the explicit application of the ‘Orientation’ and ‘Decision’ parts of
the loop to use more implicit and intuitive understanding of a changing
environment to ‘Observe’ and ‘Act’ almost simultaneously. This adaptability
compresses time, enables unexpected actions to be taken by the protagonist
60 Velocity
that in turn confuse the enemy, which then leads to even slower decisionmaking
on their part, increasing the advantage even further.
One of the key notions that Boyd drew on to explain this came from the
German concept of Blitzkrieg (‘lightning war’) warfare that involved the
use of speed and surprise through concentrations of highly mobile, motorized,
armoured units that could break through lines of defence and encircle
potential larger enemy forces.
Blitzkrieg was all about a high operational tempo that was enabled not
only through mechanized units but a form of command that empowered
frontline commanders to respond faster, and was characterized by the
concepts of Schwerpunkt and Fingerspitzengefuhl. Schwerpunkt (meaning
the underlying goal, intent or focus of effort) gave the officers on the frontline
focus, clarity of direction and objective. Fingerspitzengefuhl (meaning
fingertip feel) enabled a level of flexibility within that for officers to make
rapid, intuitive decisions on the ground in the face of fluid situations. A
frontline officer would know the intent of his superior and understand the
role of his unit in fulfilling that objective, but the executional detail could be
far more fluid and responsive.
The reduced time needed to make decisions, improved communication
and use of initiative by frontline officers, better exploitation of emerging
opportunities, and a dramatically increased tempo through which tactics
could be changed in response to new conditions, all combined with technology
(highly mobile mechanized divisions and units) to powerful effect.
Central to this new way of thinking was the idea that whoever is able to
handle the quickest rate of change would win. Boyd stressed that once the
process begins it should only accelerate. As Coram describes it:
Success is the greatest trap for the novice who properly implements the OODA
Loop. He is so amazed at what he has done that he pauses and looks around
and waits for reinforcements. But this is the time to exploit the confusion and to
press on.
(Coram, 2003)4
Boyd’s OODA loops point the way towards a new way of working for every
business. Many of today’s large organizations still subscribe to the ‘Bigger-
Higher-Faster-Farther’ philosophy that was so ingrained in the US Air Force.
Responses to significant challenges are often characterized by large, expensive,
complex implementations of new technology that ignore the need to be
more agile. All organizations want to move quicker but true agility is about
more than just speed.
Defining velocity 61
As Boyd’s work shows us, in rapidly changing environments advantage
comes from speed of response and manoeuvrability. And that’s about
people, process and culture – enabling technology to serve its wider purpose.
As Boyd so succinctly expressed: ‘People, ideas, hardware – in that order’.
Instead of the context of responding faster to enemy action in war, our
context is the need for every business to speed up response to changing
customer behaviour and need, and competitive and market context. Just
like Blitzkrieg, the key to this is how we balance a clear, overarching vision,
direction and objective with the autonomy to enable more executionally
oriented teams and managers to make and act on rapidly taken, data-driven
but also intuitively led decisions in response to swiftly changing contexts.
Velocity is important, but it is the context in which it is important that
matters. Modern business advantage comes less and less from scale and
more and more from manoeuvrability, or the ability to move quickly and

Operating
in the ‘ambiguity
zone’
In Part One of this book, we discussed Charles Handy’s S-curves as a model
for understanding how digital disrupts markets and businesses.
The overlapping S-curves (Figure 5.1) create points at which a new technology
or model enters the market (Point A), but it is also the point at
which the incumbent technology or model is well optimized and potentially
performing the best that it ever has, giving the incumbent business little
apparent reason to disrupt its own model. Yet this is, of course, also the
point of opportunity. Investment in experimentation, testing and learning,
and innovation position the company well to generate new, distinctive and
potentially disruptive ideas and therefore capitalize on a second curve.
Many organizations will only do this when they have reached point B,
and are faced with a crisis in confidence and business performance. By then
it is too late. Point B is the inflection point at which the new technology, or
model that has previously been looked down on by incumbents, scales to
the point where it becomes the dominant way forward. Like a parachutist
experiencing ground rush, the new technology ramps more quickly than
expected, leaving no time for a lagging, slow moving incumbent to respond
in an effective way.
So the answer to this dilemma, of course, is never to get to that inflection
point B. And that requires not just episodic innovation initiatives that
are instituted in response to rapidly declining performance or an existential
threat, but continual experimentation to create the opportunity to ride the
next wave before it is too late.
Yet operating in the ‘ambiguity zone’ (as we have called it) is not easy.
It requires not only a heightened level of boldness in being willing to
disrupt your already well-optimized model, but the ability to concurrently
manage more than one potentially competing business model in the same

organization, a readiness to allocate precious resources towards continual
experimentation and reinvention, and the culture to support all of those
elements.
Building velocity through continuous
innovation
In the context of the rapidly shifting competitive, company and consumer
contexts that we discussed in Part One, the organizational response now
required means that the kind of periodic, poorly coordinated innovation
efforts seen in many organizations are no longer enough. Digital-native
businesses have not only found ways to embed continuous innovation into
the fabric of what they do, but also regard it as essential to continuing
survival. In this scenario innovation is not compartmentalized into blocks
of time any more than it is confined into team silos or individual job titles.
This is about orienting the entire business towards continual exploration of
potential opportunity and progression, and creating an innovation ‘engine’
to generate a constant flow of new projects and potential value, and move
faster into areas of future opportunity.
Shifting from episodic to continuous, embedded innovation brings challenges
that are practical (like day-to-day resourcing), strategic (like the need

to resource against a longer-term vision), and cultural (not least that staff
need to feel that it is acceptable to spend time on innovative new projects
away from business as usual). So what are some of the ways to create the
kind of culture that celebrates this way of thinking, doing and being? How
do we create the space to originate, nurture and develop a continuous stream
of new ideas?
We have all heard of Google’s famed 20 per cent time, which encourages
employees to spend 20 per cent of their work time experimenting with
their own ideas, and which reportedly birthed Gmail and AdSense. But the
concept of empowering staff to take the time to work on side-projects is not
restricted to Google.
3M, for example, talk about ‘Time to Think’1 and have, since 1948,
encouraged employees to spend 15 per cent of their working time on their
own projects, utilizing 3M resources:
What would you do if you had access to world-class laboratories and scientists,
and almost one day a week to investigate a new idea?
This policy allowed the team that worked on Post-it® notes the space they
needed to devote to a development process that had to overcome multiple
barriers over the course of 12 years before launch and widespread success.
Some of the ideas that come out of Time to Think (six to eight projects,
twice a year) are supported by ‘Genesis Grants’, which can act as research
seed money of anywhere between US$30,000 to US$75,000, enabling staff
to explore ideas outside of the rigidity of business unit budgets.
The team at the UK Government Digital Service (GDS) have initiated a
policy where for a defined period (two weeks or one month) they give the
people in the team the freedom to go off the pre-planned roadmap and work
on anything they want, as long as it is for the good of GOV.UK – with fewer
top-down commitments. The policy, called a ’firebreak’, is seen as vital to
‘release some pressure from the system’, minimize top-down commitments,
take a step back, reduce layers of complexity, but also to work on new ideas.
As Neil WIlliams, one of the Product Leads at GDS wrote:2
A whole team working off-roadmap for a whole month might sound reckless
or indulgent. But in fact, it would have been reckless not to… Great things can
happen when you give creative, passionate people the freedom to explore ideas.
Ideas, problems and opportunities are collated for a month leading up to
the firebreak. Pitch and demo meetings allowed everyone to keep up to date
and decide what they wanted to work on. Learnings from the process are
captured in wrap-up meetings.
66 Velocity
Hackathons and hackdays are focused ways for digital-native organizations
to carve out time for new ideas and prototypes. As well as running
monthly hackdays when employees can work on anything they want,
LinkedIn initiated a quarterly project called (in)cubator3 where any
employee, whether they work in engineering, sales, design or HR, can come
up with an idea relating to any part of the business and pitch it to the executive
staff. If the project is approved the team can spend up to three months
of dedicated time to work on developing the idea. But in addition, the executive
staff commit to mentoring the project leads to do everything they can
to help it to be successful.
Similarly Apple has an initiative, called Blue Sky,4 that gives employees
two weeks away from their usual job to work on special projects, and Spotify
runs regular ‘hack weeks’ with a similar aim.5 Facebook has a long (well,
since 2007, which is long in Facebook years) tradition of running hackdays6
(and nights) where engineers and other staff come together to build anything
they want, the only rule being that it must not be the same thing that you
work on in the day job. Many of Facebook’s best-known features (including
chat, video sharing, the Like button, and the Timeline) have originated
from hackathons. In the run-up to a hackathon, engineers submit potential
ideas and groups form organically to work on them. Pedram Kenyani, the
engineer who kicked off the practice of all-night hackathons at Facebook
has said about them:7
It’s a way to experiment with ideas in a low-cost way. Lots don’t make it into
products, but every hackathon tends to result in four or five things implemented
on the site. A couple have changed the direction of the company.
Such hackathons go far beyond the traditional company ideas scheme, and
are regular and deliberately created opportunities to generate the space to
progress ideas from thought into prototype. The practice of carving out dedicated
time to focus on innovative projects is not new, but what is different is
the scale and breadth of how this culture is systematized in the digital-native
organization. In this context, these kinds of embedded conventions are seen
not as a nice to have, but as essential to the fabric of how the company runs
and to its success in the future.
In a digitally empowered world it is simply not enough for innovation
to be episodic. Joel Gascoigne, the co-founder of social sharing app Buffer,
has written about how the strategy that they have adopted in order to bake
innovation into the business and stay agile as they scale.8 This involves
focusing resources on a balance of three key areas:
Operating in the ‘ambiguity zone’ 67
1 ‘Core’ areas mean those that are related to the fundamentals of what
Buffer already is.
2 ‘Expansion’ is the term for ‘any projects worked on which are logical
expansions of what the product already is’.
3 ‘Labs’ is higher risk stuff that they ‘want to just try and see what happens’.
This strategy is an echo of the approach taken at LinkedIn which similarly
features ‘core’, ‘expand’ and ‘venture’ projects, and which co-founder Reid
Hoffman describes9 as a framework for keeping the company innovative.
Working continuously on all three areas enables both Buffer and LinkedIn
to focus not just on incremental improvement and expansion but also breakthrough
innovation.
Joel Gascoigne believes that the ratio between these three elements at
Buffer is around 50:30:20 but each organization will inevitably need to find
their own levels. One alternative split comes from Intuit (the financial software
business that thinks of itself as a ‘30 year-old start-up’). Speaking at
SXSWi in 2013, Intuit CEO Scott Cook described a 70:20:10 model for
products and budgeting:10
●● 70 per cent is focused on the core or oldest products, with the objective
of incremental growth and maintaining profit. This is the ‘rowing team’.
●● 20 per cent is focused on young to mid-stage products with an objective
of profitable growth. These are the ‘white water rafters’.
●● 10 per cent is on completely new products, about solving user problems
and proving a leap of faith. This is the equivalent of ‘diving for sunken
treasure’.
Intuit deliberately structure resourcing in this way so that they can successfully
bake experimentation into business as usual. Similarly, Google have
adopted a 70/20/10 approach to time and focus whereby 70 per cent
of management time should be focused on the core business or areas of
responsibility, 20 per cent should be on related projects, and 10 per cent
on unrelated new businesses or ideas.11 This is a way of embedding fresh
perspectives and different thinking into the company.
Their approach is resonant of three horizons thinking (first espoused
in Christian Terwiesch and Karl Ulrich’s book Innovation Tournaments:
Creating and selecting exceptional opportunities):12
●● Horizon 1 is about incremental improvements or extensions to existing
brands or products. This type of innovation typically focuses on existing
68 Velocity
markets or utilizes existing technologies that the company is familiar
with, and is likely the easiest and most common form of innovation.
●● Horizon 2 innovations are more about adjacencies, next generation products
and likely focused on existing markets or technologies but perhaps
ones that the company is less familiar with. Because of this, it requires
different thinking and techniques from Horizon 1.
●● Horizon 3 innovations are entirely new, breakthrough products or categories
that are pushing the boundaries, and pushing the company to
explore new markets or technologies.
It is important for companies to focus not just on easier, incremental innovation
but to recognize the need for a more comprehensive approach that
also recognizes the differences inherent in these different types. While it may
not always be necessary to run all three types of innovation concurrently,
digital-native organizations are adept at accommodating all three, switching
the balance of focus between them as required, and maintaining the kind
of thinking, culture and expectations that can enable all three to thrive. An
important part of this will be setting realistic expectations for failure (and
learning). The failure rate expected in Horizon 1, for example, should be
very different from that set for Horizon 3. Unrealistic or poorly planned
expectations can kill fragile initiatives before they have even had the chance
to properly prove their worth or reveal a larger potential opportunity down
the line. Adopting a 70:20:10 approach to resourcing akin to that at Intuit
may be challenging in the face of short-term targets and stretched resourcing
but is perhaps a more palatable way of supporting potentially breakthrough
ideas, and in today’s rapidly shifting environment can companies really
afford not to do that?
More experimentation = more opportunity
While we have plenty of well-documented examples of businesses that have
shown an inability to respond to rapidly changing market and consumer
dynamics (RIM/Blackberry, Kodak, Nokia, Blockbuster), there are also
examples of companies that are not afraid to reinvent themselves. Apple’s
revenues have grown dramatically since the return of Steve Jobs to the
company in 1997, but so has their composition, not least through a product
development programme (iPods, smartphones and tablets) that shows itself
to be unafraid of potential cannibalization.
Operating in the ‘ambiguity zone’ 69
IBM is a business that has reinvented itself multiple times over its 100+
year history from creating punch card systems for payroll data, to originating
bar codes and credit card magnetic strips, to developing computer
disc drives, chips and a huge mainframe computing business to computing
service delivery, a cloud-based offering, technology and digital transformation
consultancy, and the development of a design and UX service offering.
Their history has not been short of existential crises, but each one of these
transformations has involved a reinvention of business models, organizational
structure and skills profile.
Yet the pace of innovation and organizational response has dramatically
sharpened. Facebook have radically changed their revenue base from a position
at IPO in 2012 where they were deriving next to zero monetary benefit
from mobile to where, just four years later, 84 per cent of their advertising
revenue base is mobile.13 Their acquisition strategy sees them actively
buying up rival services (Instagram, WhatsApp) that pose a potential future
threat but instead of then shutting those services down, they enable them to
coexist alongside services like Facebook Messenger that have been generated
in-house through a continuous programme of innovation.
That innovation is combined with a high-tempo continual improvement
of core services – what the Japanese might call ‘Kaizen’, the culture of
continuous improvement.14 The point here is that investment in continual
iteration and innovation creates opportunity at scale, and opportunity that
is not always obvious at initiation. Steven Johnson, the author of ‘How We
Get To Now’,15 tells the story of how Gutenberg’s printing press is an example
of an invention that had a number of unanticipated effects. One of the
impacts of many more people across Europe starting to read was the realization
that many people were far-sighted. This resulted in a surge in demand
for spectacles, which in turn meant an increase in experimentation with
lenses right across Europe, which led to innovations including the telescope
and the microscope:
Almost immediately there is this extraordinary scientific revolution in terms of
understanding and identifying the cell, and identifying the moons of Jupiter and
all these different things that Galileo does. So the Gutenberg press ended up
having this very strange effect on science that wasn’t about the content of the
books being published.16
One of the most undervalued consequences of high-volume, high-paced
innovation and iteration is the creation of opportunity that you didn’t even
knew existed.
70 Velocity
Marginal and breakthrough innovation
It is easy, perhaps informed by past successes or competitive activity, for
companies to think of innovation in relatively one-dimensional ways. We
might over-focus, for example, on marginal innovation that brings incremental
gain and continuous improvement over time. While this can bring
huge benefit, it can often be at the expense of breakthrough innovation
that involves high risk, different thinking, frequent failure but big potential
gain. Yet both are, of course, necessary. Both forms of innovation are vital
because, in the words of author and economist Tim Harford:
marginal improvement is all about climbing the hill you’re on… longshots are
all about finding new mountains to conquer.17
The biggest problem with an overemphasis on marginal, incremental innovation
was neatly summed up by Google founder Larry Page in his 2013
letter to investors:18
It’s… true that over time many companies get comfortable doing what they
have always done, with a few incremental changes. This kind of incrementalism
leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, because change tends to
be revolutionary, not evolutionary.
Later in this section we will focus on ways to break out of incremental
thinking and into the realms of the truly disruptive.
The case for a more iterative, emergent
approach
A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple
system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: a complex
system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You
have to start over, beginning with a simple system.
John Gall, systems theorist
‘Gall’s Law’, as expressed above, comes from John Gall’s 1975 book
Systemantics: How systems work and especially how they fail.19 Gall’s work
has inspired a number of authors in systems thinking but the book actually
focuses more on what we can learn from system engineering failures
and how not to design systems. The law (although it was never expressly
Operating in the ‘ambiguity zone’ 71
stated as a law in the book) is essentially an argument in favour of under-specification
(so it has a natural affinity to agile thinking which we will
discuss later) and argues that owing to the difficulty involved in designing
large complex systems accurately, it is far better instead to design smaller,
simpler systems that can then develop incrementally based on a continual
input and measurement of user interaction and needs.
This was, and is, a simple concept and yet it is quite profound. Think of all
the complex systems that we try to design and launch (from large IT projects to
government policy implementation) that fail from the outset. As Josh Kaufman
has pointed out in his explanation of Gall’s Law, complex systems are full of
interdependencies and variations that are almost impossible to anticipate but
that actually play a significant role in making the system function:
Complex systems designed from scratch will never work in the real world,
since they haven’t been subject to environmental selection forces while being
designed… If you want to build a system that works, the best approach is to
build a simple system that meets the environment’s current selection tests first,
then improve it over time.20
Far better surely, to start with something simpler, easier, smaller and evolve
from there. This is why, in scenarios characterized by complexity (such as
those within which most businesses now operate), prototypical, emergent,
iterative approaches work best.
The problem with waterfall
Waterfall development is the classic linear, non-adaptive design-and-build
process that has long been applied to software development. Progression
in waterfall is linear since once each phase has been completed there
is no returning to it. Rather than originating from software design, the
process actually originated from other industries (such as manufacturing
and construction) where the cost or practicality of making changes to a
completed stage was prohibitive.
Waterfall methodologies involve a progression from an (often extensive
and lengthy) requirements capturing and analysis process, through (often
detailed and protracted) design and build stages, then (frequently arduous)
testing and debugging, before finally being installed and becoming operational.
While this can work for projects where requirements are rigid and
unchanging, there are several key challenges with waterfall processes:
72 Velocity
●● Requirements-gathering processes are frequently poor at capturing real
user need. People do not always know what they want. Many needs are
unexpected.
●● The detailed, linear, sequential nature of the process (you should only
move to the next stage once the previous one has been reviewed) means
that it is frequently a very lengthy process.
●● This can also mean that functional interaction (for example, between
designers and coders) is limited, and concurrent working on the same
problem restricted, which can lead to designers designing elements that
cannot work, or developers coding without design input.
●● Requirements and contexts now change at a faster pace than ever but
waterfall is poor at adapting to changing needs (once a stage is complete
it is very difficult to go back and make amends), meaning that by the time
the end user sees the first version of the product or system updates are
required straightaway or it is even no longer fit for purpose.
●● Unforeseen problems or needs are less easy to identify along the way
since all the requirements capturing has been done upfront.
As we will discuss later, waterfall thinking is emblematic of traditional
approaches to strategy, planning and execution that still exist inside most
organizations. In a world characterized by accelerating change, the kind of
issues that waterfall throws up – inflexibility and linearity, lack of adaptability
to changing requirements and contexts, lack of pace and momentum,
poor cross-functional collaborative working, are akin to many of the issues
that these traditional ways of working now present. Put simply, the problem
is not only with the process, but with the mindset, thinking and behaviours
that surround it.
The three types of problem in the world
We know that every problem is different but we are often susceptible to
misdiagnosing the nature of the obstacle that we are facing, and therefore
the correct approach to deriving a solution. American surgeon and
author Atul Gawande makes a compelling case in his book The Checklist
Manifesto21 for how the quantity and complexity of knowledge required to
execute many tasks in the modern world restricts our ability to do it consistently
and correctly, and how something as simple as a checklist can be a
powerful driver of accuracy, dependability and performance.
Operating in the ‘ambiguity zone’ 73
Gawande makes a point of acknowledging the importance of recognizing
the correct type of challenge that we are facing, referencing the three types
of problem in the world delineated in a paper on reform in the healthcare
industry by Brenda Zimmerman of York University and Sholom Glouberman
of the University of Toronto:22
1 Simple problems are ones like baking a cake from a mix. There is a
recipe.
2 Complicated problems are ones like sending a rocket to the moon. They
can sometimes be broken down into a series of simple problems. But
there is no straightforward recipe. Success frequently requires multiple
people, often multiple teams, and specialized expertise. Unanticipated
difficulties are frequent. Timing and coordination become serious
concerns.
3 Complex problems are ones like raising a child. Once you learn how
to send a rocket to the moon, you can repeat the process with other
rockets and perfect it. One rocket is like another rocket. But not so
with raising a child, the professors point out. Every child is unique.
Although raising one child may provide experience, it does not guarantee
success with the next child. Expertise is valuable but most certainly
not sufficient. Indeed, the next child may require an entirely different
approach from the previous one. And this brings up another feature of
complex problems: their outcomes remain highly uncertain. Yet we all
know that it is possible to raise a child well. It’s complex, that’s all.
Zimmerman and Glouberman go on to contend that we (in the context of
the paper they are talking about healthcare experts) often:
… implicitly describe complex problems as complicated ones and hence employ
solutions that are wedded to rational planning approaches. These often lead to
inappropriate solutions because they neglect many aspects of complexity.
This, say the authors, is like the old joke about the policeman who sees a
drunk man searching for something under a streetlight and asks what the
drunk has lost. He says that he has lost his keys and so they both look under
the streetlight together. After a few minutes the policeman asks if he is sure
he lost them here, and the drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the
park. The policeman asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies,
‘this is where the light is’. Our observational bias, and the sophistication of
our theories, models and language, say the authors, can be as seductive as
the lamplight. They might provide an illusion of clarity but they can also
74 Velocity
lead to approaches that do not properly take account of complex adaptive
systems and situations.
In the context of the modern business environment, which is more than
ever characterized by complexity, it becomes essential that we define challenges
in the right way, avoid conflating the complex with the complicated,
and set about shaping the response to those challenges in the right way.
Complex scenarios require emergent solutions
‘Best practice’ is one of those terms that, while not inherently bad, has
become so overused as to be stretched beyond its rightful application. So it
gets applied generically to any scenario where an understanding of the most
effective methods to solve a problem is desired. Our wish to create certainty
out of ambiguity, and to impose control over the unpredictable leads us to
wish to standardize approaches and apply best practice to many distinct
types of situation. But as we have shown there is a big difference between
simple, complicated and complex challenges.

Operating in the ‘ambiguity zone’ 75
An excellent way of framing the difference in our response to each of
these types of challenge comes from Dave Snowden’s Cynefin model,23 a
useful framework for decision-making (Figure 5.2).
Simple contexts, characterized by stable, clear cause-and-effect relationships
and ‘known knowns’ are the domain of best practice. Managers,
says Dave, might appraise a situation and base a response on established
processes. The hazards here come from complacency and entrained thinking,
which might blind us to new perspectives.
Complicated contexts may still have a clear relationship between cause
and effect but can also contain many applicable answers, some of which
are not immediately obvious (‘known unknowns’), and so this requires
analysis of suitable options and is typically the domain of experts. Good
practice is therefore more appropriate than best practice. The danger in this
context comes from experts who are biased towards preferred solutions,
over-analysis
leading to paralysis, or from ignoring potentially innovative
ideas from non-experts.
Complex contexts, however, are constantly shifting (‘unknown unknowns’).
As Dave Snowden notes, the temptation in the face of such unpredictability is
to demand certainty in the form of foolproof plans with precise outcomes: to
revert to a command-and-control leadership style; to become less patient. But
in complex contexts we can only understand why things happen in retrospect
and answers are emergent so we need to look for instructive patterns through
experimentation. Encouraging the conducting of experiments that are as ‘safe
to fail’ as possible enables informative patterns and a clearer direction to
emerge. Imposing a desire for order or a rigidly defined course of action will
preempt the opportunity for such instructive patterns to emerge.
In chaotic contexts no manageable patterns exist, the relationship between
cause and effect is impossible to define, and so clear, concise and immediate
action to establish as much order and stability as possible is what is required.
Leaders need to work to transform situations from chaos to complexity where
emerging patterns might be identified and suitable responses determined.
If the world of business is increasingly characterized by uncertainty,
continuous flux and complex contexts, then the bad side of best practice
is that we seek to oversimplify and use it as a way of seeking certainty
in situations that require a more emergent pattern of decision-making. As
Dave notes, best practice is, by definition, past practice but hindsight no
longer leads to foresight after a shift in context. While it may be appropriate
in simple contexts, misappropriation of best practice in today’s ever-more
complex world means that we are in danger of becoming the drunk searching
for his keys in the streetlight.

processes
If the modern business environment requires more adaptive, emergent and iterative
ways of working, there are several foundational concepts which provide
us with not only effective, well-proven processes but also ways of thinking
that are highly relevant, applicable and instructive. We are talking about agile,
lean, design thinking, and the many variant processes that they have spawned.
The dynamism, flexibility and non-linearity of these foundational methodologies
make them far more apposite for today’s complex environments. Small
wonder, therefore, that they are expanding beyond startups, innovation labs
and technology teams to become embedded in wider business thinking, inspiring
new approaches and fundamentally different ways of operating.
Design thinking
The growing importance of design in business has become evident from
the heavy investment that companies in a number of sectors are making in
design and user experience talent. Not least of these are consulting businesses
including Deloitte, Accenture and IBM (IBM have structured frameworks
around design thinking to help IBM-ers solve users’ problems at speed and
scale)1 who have refocused recruitment and acquisition programmes to
serve a far greater requirement for design skills and approaches.
Design thinking was really first adapted for business by David Kelley
and Tim Brown, founders of design business IDEO. Tim Brown has defined
design thinking as:
… a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s
toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the
requirements for business success.2
The process involves a broader application of design methods to business
and innovation, using solution-focused thinking, starting with a future goal,
and investigating both present and future conditions to iteratively generate
06
78
Digital-native processes 79
multiple ideas and options and simultaneously explore alternative routes to
achieving the goal. IDEO, for example, look for the intersection that: ‘brings
together what is desirable from a human point of view with what is technologically
feasible and economically viable’.3
Key to design thinking is the successive application of divergent and
convergent thinking, the former being about originating multiple possibilities,
the latter about narrowing these choices down and selecting the
optimal way forwards. One example of a design thinking process incorporates
seven stages: define, research, ideate, prototype, choose, implement
and learn.4 This process has similarities to the lean learning loop that we will
look at later, but with design thinking these steps are not always linear and
may be repeated in order to find better solutions. Like agile and lean, design
thinking maintains a strong focus on the user (through empathy) and also
teamwork, and some of the tools used including customer journey mapping,
empathy mapping, paper prototyping and personas may be applied to add
value across all three approaches.
Agile
Published in 2001, the Agile Manifesto5 arose from a meeting of software
developers at the Snowbird resort in Utah who had come together to discuss
lightweight development philosophies that had evolved as a counterpoint to
more rigid processes such as waterfall. Although iterative, adaptive processes
had been around for a number of years, the manifesto helps capture a new
way of working that recognized some key shifts in value (‘while there is
value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more’):
●● Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
●● Working software over comprehensive documentation
●● Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
●● Responding to change over following a plan.
Since then, agile software development practices have grown into widely
adopted and extremely robust processes. A number of iterative development
methodologies are often categorized under the agile umbrella (including
SCRUM, Kanban, XP, Crystal) but agile has revolutionized the way in
which technology teams work, and software gets built. The key concepts,
characteristics and practices inherent in agile software development methods
include (Figure 6.1):
80 Velocity
●● the use of cross-functional teams drawn from all the key functions
(to allow for requirements to change over time, in place of rigorous, rigid,
upfront specification
●● teams that are are self-organizing, with a high degree of autonomy
●● co-location and face-to-face communication prioritized to enable speed
●● teams working iteratively in blocks of time or sprints (typically 1–4
weeks) against an agreed set of priorities, which may require multiple
sprints to release new features or a product but the objective is usually to
be able to release working outputs at the end of each sprint
●● working outputs that can be demonstrated to stakeholders whose feedback
is incorporated into the next or future work sprints
●● the product backlog organizing and prioritizing work based on business
and user value – priorities are revisited at the start of every sprint into a
sprint backlog
●● daily stand-up gatherings (or ‘scrums’ as they are sometimes called) creating
short feedback loops and enabling team members to report daily
progress and intentions towards the team and sprint goals, or any barriers
to progress that have been encountered
●● the product owner as a key part of the team, and the representative of the
customer or end user (key stakeholders in the business agree in advance
that the product owner can act on their behalf) – they are available to
developers to answers questions during the sprint

●● transparency is key, with physical displays near the team presenting a
summary of progress and current status
●● a focus on quality maintained through specific design processes and testing
methodologies that are designed to also support agility.
A key advantage of agile methodologies comes from the ability to adapt to
changing realities quickly and therefore minimize overall risk. Longer-term
goals may be set but there is much greater flexibility built into the path
to achieving them. Built-in retrospectives at the end of each sprint ensure
that the quality of prioritization and work in the next sprint is as good as
it can be. Methods that are more predictive (like waterfall) attempt to plan
out the future context or requirements in comprehensive detail that limits
the ability to change along the way. In a rapidly shifting environment this
carries significant inherent risk, particularly if that early analysis or planning
is flawed.
In agile, the principle is to ‘release early and often’. Testing is generally
conducted on an ongoing basis and incorporated into the same iteration as
the coding work rather than being separated out into a distinct phase. This
means that end users can have far more visibility of development work and
progress, and can better understand the value. This inclusive approach is
highly transparent and minimizes the risk of misalignment (which in noniterative
processes can become steadily worse over time), generates better
quality feedback through enabling the end users to make better decisions
on where the real value/issues are in working outputs (because they can
actually use them), and see the progressive build of value over time through
frequent releases.
Agile is not without its challenges. Moving to agile working is a significant
shift in culture and working practice. It can easily bump up against existing
business processes and prioritization. A half-hearted implementation of
agile (or what we term later as ‘doing waterfall in an agile way’) will more
often than not fail. There is a healthy dose of delusion in business wrapped
up in our belief that we can forecast future needs, situations and outcomes
even in highly complex and fluid environments, and yet the apparent lack
of long-term predictability inherent in agile can leave many leaders uncomfortable
embarking on a roadmap where every step has not already been
mapped out. Leaders may also feel uncomfortable having to do without
many of the totems of more traditional approaches such as comprehensive
documentation in the initial stages of a project. Coaches in agile, and intermediary
roles such as the product owner or product manager can often play
a key part in mitigating some these risks. But it is important to recognize
that the philosophy and principles that surround this methodology and that
82 Velocity
were expressed in the Agile Manifesto all those years ago do not stop with
the technology team running an agile software development process. This
speaks to the much bigger opportunity that has inspired this book.
Lean
The foundation for lean thinking was established through lean manufacturing,
an approach that considered anything in a production process outside
of the creation of value for the end customer as wastage and systematically
seeks to remove it. This in turn was inspired by the Toyota Production
System (TPS) which had identified ‘seven wastes’ including defects, inventory
(minimizing anything not in process) and overproduction (the idea of
‘just in time’ production rather than producing ahead of demand) that were
then methodically eliminated. Lean manufacturing therefore sought to only
bring in necessary inputs to the process at the point they were needed, and
identify imperfections in output as early in the process as possible to minimize
correction time. TPS and lean manufacturing sit alongside the Japanese
practice of ‘Kaizen’ (meaning ‘improvement’) which, in the business context,
relates to the involvement of employees at all levels in the continuous incremental
improvement of the manufacturing process.
In 2008, Eric Ries took some of these ideas and combined them with
his own experience in startups to originate the lean startup,6 the product
development methodology that shares some similar overarching principles
to agile. Like lean manufacturing, it seeks to eliminate waste. Like agile, the
process is iterative with continuous product releases and customer feedback
embedded as a key part of the process. Hypotheses about customer need
or product features are successively validated through iterative releases or
rapid prototyping, thereby minimizing risk and the need for large initial
investment, and enabling continuous learning.
Ries believes that the continuous involvement of customers in the development
process enables startups (and any business developing new products
and services) to inclusively recruit early adopters and solve real customer
problems before attempting to acquire scale. The core concepts that sit at
the heart of lean are:
●● The build-measure-learn loop: An iterative cycle that follows a process
of identifying a hypothesis (about a specific customer need or product
feature), designing a test that will validate that hypothesis (often
the simplest possible prototype), testing wherever possible with real
Digital-native processes 83
customers, and taking the learning into the next learning loop. This methodology
is designed to eliminate as much uncertainty as possible from
the development process, and to continuously test and learn en route to
fulfilling a vision.
●● The minimum viable product (MVP): In his book, Ries describes the
MVP as the ‘version of a new product which allows a team to collect
the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the
least effort’.7 MVPs can be developed to test a new hypothesis, but the
principle is to create the simplest possible test or prototype to validate
that idea and enable progression on to the next learning loop as quickly
as possible.
●● Innovation accounting: Traditional accounting methods work well with
established products or propositions but can stifle innovation, a new idea
or a startup business by focusing on the wrong metrics (like ratio and cash
flow analysis) that set unrealistic expectations about early revenue generation.
Innovation accounting focuses on ‘actionable metrics’ (as opposed
to ‘vanity metrics’ that do not accurately represent the performance and
business drivers) that measure early progress and enable better prioritization.
These might include customer usage and retention measures.
●● The pivot: Ries describes the pivot is a ‘structured course correction
designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy,
and engine of growth’. Pivots might enable a refocusing of the
product proposition or key features while still maintaining the guiding
vision for the business or product.
While agile software development may be typically used in technology
teams, and design thinking and lean mainly applied in the service of product
and service development, the principles, practices and philosophy that
surround all three have far broader application for the way in which we
conduct business and secure competitive advantage.
The principles of agile business
The Agile Manifesto gives us a blueprint for a better way of developing
software, but it also speaks to some fundamental principles for doing better
business in the complex adaptive environment we know today. The 12 principles
of agile business align closely with those that were originated in the
manifesto (Table 6.1):

Digital-native processes 85
These principles for agile business set out a new orientation for the digitally
empowered business. They concern the very fabric of how an organization
works.
Developing a learning culture
Agile, lean and design thinking have dramatically changed the way in which
technology teams, startups and innovation labs work, but this revolution
does not stop with the innovators, entrepreneurs and technologists.
The principles and practices that are integral to this more adaptive way of
working have much broader application throughout business but just as
importantly (as we will go on to discuss in Part Four) in order to deliver
real value they all require the organizational culture that can enable them to
survive and to flourish.
There is not one right process. Each team or business will find that there
are methodologies that they are more comfortable with, and that different
scenarios and environments call for different approaches. Rather it is more
often about how you can combine different approaches and processes for
optimum impact and for the job to be done. Yet all of these ways of thinking
and working have commonality in approaches and outlook that are integral
to operating in the modern business environment. Not least of these is their
need to operate within, and their ability to support and catalyse an organizational
culture that is all about learning.
We have all heard the platitudes to ‘fail fast’, ‘embrace failure’, or ‘fail
forwards’. Yet failure in isolation is an unwanted and unnecessary distraction.
So let’s instead talk about the value of learning cultures. Ed Catmull,
President of Pixar, one of the most successful film businesses of all time has
said that:
Agile Manifesto Principle Agile Business Principle
11 The best architectures,
requirements and designs emerge
from self-organizing teams
The best results emerge from
small teams with a high degree of
autonomy
12 At regular intervals, the team
reflects on how to become more
effective, then tunes and adjusts its
behaviour accordingly
Continuous improvement is
achieved through embedded
reflection time, and behaviours and
culture that support learning
Table 6.1 (Continued)
86 Velocity
Failure isn’t a necessary evil. In fact, it isn’t evil at all. It is a necessary
consequence of doing something new.
… and
If you aren’t experiencing failure, then you are making a far worse mistake:
You are being driven by the desire to avoid it.8
And he’s right. But he also said: ‘When faced with a challenge, get smarter’.
The point about failure is that we need to use every experience, good or bad,
as an opportunity to learn so that we get continually better and smarter over
time. To paraphrase the venture capitalist Marc Andreesen:
The goal is not to fail fast. The goal is to succeed over the long run. They are
not the same thing.9
The agile business is one that is continually exploring but also one that
is continually learning. Author Jim Collins followed up the bestselling
Good to Great a decade later, with Great by Choice,10 based on nine
years of research into companies that had risen to great things from
times of uncertainty. One of the key differences he identified between
these companies and others that did much less well was the practice of
what he termed ‘empirical creativity’. This he defined with a ‘bullets’ and
‘cannonballs’ metaphor. Instead of firing cannonballs (putting significant
resources behind untested ideas), the more successful businesses began by
firing smaller bullets (they prepared the way with lots of low cost, low
risk, low distraction tests at a far smaller scale in order to develop learnings
about what works and what doesn’t). In other words, they made lots
of small bets.
This kind of ‘empirical creativity’, he says, is a blend between creativity
and discipline, involving the habit of continually learning from a stream
of both successful and unsuccessful experiments and initiatives. On any
given day, Facebook are running hundreds of tests concurrently.11 Each
year, Google reportedly changes its search algorithm around 500–600
times.12 When they launched the first version of their pay-per-click advertising
product AdWords in 1999 it initially was not very successful but
through constant iteration Google have built a product that is today
worth billions of dollars. But iteration doesn’t stop. Tens of thousands of
quality experiments are still run each year for both search and advertising
products.
The agile business is not one that experiments episodically, but instead
builds a culture characterized by continuous testing and learning. Whether
it is constant testing conducted at high tempo and designed to incrementally
Digital-native processes 87
improve existing services, or test and learn focused on a perpetual stream of
new and potentially breakthrough initiatives, developing a learning culture
it seems, is critical not only to performance but also to survival.
Stories from the frontline
Marco Ryan, EVP, Chief Digital Officer, Wartsila Corporation (and digital
transformation veteran): Test. Learn. Optimize
Perhaps one of the hardest success factors to implement is cultural
change. For many, technology decisions, marketing budgets, investments
in websites are easier to measure and easier to understand.
But what will make the transformation stick – what will cause it
to deliver the value – is the people. And most organizations struggle
with the availability and capability of their talent, to focus on the digital
transformation. This is often largely due to approaching it the wrong way.
Large-scale process re-engineering projects, tied for example to changes in
an ERP system, will absorb both the resources and their appetite for change.
An alternative, and more digital approach, is to continuously ‘test, learn
and optimize’. This allows shorter timelines, and importantly, enables
unsuccessful initiatives to be halted quickly. It is what makes the startups
able to outpace the more traditional companies and it can be applied to all
parts of the business.
The approach, combined with a hypothesis, good data, the ability to
create a pilot, mock-up or prototype, to work in small cross-functional
teams often without the need for centralized IT resources, can quickly
get a product, idea or service to market, in a high fidelity state that can
be tested with a trusted client, improved or perhaps halted. In a digitally
transformed company, failure is okay, providing you fail fast, learn from it
and improve the next iteration.
Too many companies are afraid to try or lack resources to mentor and
coach teams through this new way of working. This can be easily addressed
through external input or interims in the short term. But the sin is not to try.
The dangers of systematic survival bias
In 1943, US mathematician and statistician Abraham Wald was part of a
group asked to advise the US Air Force on how they might reinforce their
planes to prevent so many of them being lost on bombing raids to enemy fire.
88 Velocity
The challenge was that there was only a limited amount of armour plating
that could be used on the plane if it were to still fly. Research by the
military into damage to planes that had returned from missions revealed
that bombers were often riddled with bullets in the wings, the centre of the
fuselage and around the tail gunner. So they proposed to reinforce these
areas where they could see the most damage.
Wald told them that this was a big mistake, and that they should in
fact do the opposite. He recognized that what the bullet holes were in
fact showing was where a plane could be hit and still survive to make it
home. The reinforcement actually needed to be placed in the areas where
the surviving planes looked unscathed, since planes hit in these areas never
returned. Wald went on to use a complex series of equations to work out
the vulnerability of individual parts of a plane. Calculations that are still
in use today.
Survival bias leads us to overly focus on the successful, to the detriment
or oversight of what we can learn from the unsuccessful, and can
lead to false conclusions. In organizations we tend to be exceptionally
good at looking at successes as the learning exemplars and exceptionally
bad at building in reflection time so that we might encourage the kind
of learning culture that can create the kind of advantage that Amazon
founder Jeff Bezos talks about when he depicts why Amazon is the best
place in the world to fail. If you swing for the fences, he says, you will
inevitably strike out frequently but now and then you will hit a home
run. What is different between baseball and business though, is that the
former has limited outcomes (the most runs you can get is four). In business,
however:
… every once in awhile, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000
runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it’s important to be bold.
Big winners pay for so many experiments.
(Bezos, 2016)13
Learning to unlearn
It makes intuitive sense that organizations that focus on continuous learning
should fair better in complex adaptive environments. But one of the less
obvious benefits of learning the new is that it helps you to unlearn old habits
and practices.
Digital-native processes 89
A study from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and the
University Pablo Olavide in Sevilla, Spain, showed that our brains actively
erase memories in order to make space for new ones, a process that seemingly
only happens in learning situations.14 In other words we forget through
learning.
As we will discuss later, iterative and sprint working methodologies are
founded on principles of reflection, learning and application through tight
feedback loops from customer interaction or team retrospectives at the end
of sprints. In the context of digital transformation the point of adopting
new working structures and processes is not only to learn new ways of
working but also to help disentangle the company from legacy thinking
and practices.
We forget the old through learning the new. To quote author,
inventor and thinker Buckminster Fuller:
You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something,
build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.
In other words (and here to paraphrase the character Socrates from Dan
Millman’s book The Way of the Peaceful Warrior)15 the secret of change is to
focus all your energy not on fighting the old but on building the new.
Fixed and growth mindsets
Stanford Psychologist Carol Dweck (in Mindset)16 has described the fundamental
difference in how we view our personality, and between what she
calls ‘fixed’ and ‘growth’ mindsets. The former, she says, is the view that
your intelligence, character and creative ability are static and so cannot
change in a meaningful way. If successful, those who have fixed mindsets
regard that success as:
… the affirmation of that inherent intelligence, an assessment of how those
givens measure up against an equally fixed standard; striving for success and
avoiding failure at all costs become a way of maintaining the sense of being
smart or skilled.
Those with a growth mindset, on the other hand, relish challenges and rather
than seeing failure as evidence of unintelligence, regard it as an opportunity
for growth and improving existing capabilities. We can draw clear parallel
between individual and organization. The agile business has a growth mindset.
It sees every initiative as an opportunity to learn.
90 Velocity
Embedding reflection time
One of the key ways in which organizations can develop an ingrained learning
culture is through embedding the practice of reflective thinking and
retrospectives. Unlike critical thinking, which is a way of utilizing different
techniques of reasoning and insight in order to increase the probability of a
desired outcome or goal, reflective thinking focuses on the analysis of past
experiences to draw learning that might be applied in the future.
Two influential thinkers on organizational learning, Donald Schön and
Chris Argyris, created a useful way of thinking about the application of
what Schön called ‘reflective practice’, the ability of organizations to not
only incorporate as broad a perspective as possible from the experience of
individuals and the company itself, but to continually improve through a
feedback loop of experience, learning and practice. They considered three
key elements:
1 Governing variables: the dimensions that people are trying to keep within
acceptable or accepted limits.
2 Action strategies: the plans and activities used to keep governing values
within the acceptable range.
3 Consequences: the intended or unintended results of an action.
Learning, they said, involves identifying and correcting errors but when
something goes wrong people initially look for an alternative strategy that
will work within the existing governing variables in what they called ‘singleloop
learning’. Single-loop learning is an error and correction process that
enables the organization to continue current policies in order to achieve its
objectives. So organizations operationalize responses to changing market
conditions. ‘Double-loop learning’ on the other hand, involves questioning
the governing variables themselves:
Single-loop learning is like a thermostat that learns when it is too hot or
too cold and turns the heat on or off… Double-loop learning occurs when
error is detected and corrected in ways that involve the modification of an
organization’s underlying norms, policies and objectives.17
Good reflective practice in the agile business should not only focus on
single-loop error and correction, but more fundamental consideration of
new and improved ways of working, and challenging and changing established
norms.
Digital-native processes 91
Reflection is built in to agile methodologies (the last Agile Manifesto
principle is: ‘At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly’) through the practice
of retrospectives. These are used as a simple way to gather the team,
typically at the end of a sprint, and hold a (often facilitated) reflection on
their work and way of operating and how it might be improved in the next
sprint. Actions are captured, made visible and then revisited.
One of the simplest (and therefore best) frameworks for reflection actually
originated from the US military. The so-called ‘after action review’18
would be used in de-briefs as a way of improving performance, and features
four simple questions that can be answered after an action of some kind:
1 What did we expect to happen? Knowing that you have to answer this
question afterwards means that you go in with a greater clarity of objective
and desired outcome.
2 What actually happened? A blameless analysis, that identifies key events,
actions and influences, and creates a consensus.
3 Why was or wasn’t there a difference? What were the differences (if any)
between desired and actual outcomes, and why did this difference occur?
4 What can you do next time to improve or ensure these results? What (if
anything) are you going to do different next time? What should you do
more of/the same/less of? What needs fixing? What worked and is repeatable
or scalable? The idea is that at least half of the time of the review
should be spent answering this question.
Most businesses are pretty bad at taking time out to reflect and learn. There
is always pressure to move straight on to the next target, the next priority,
the next project. Yet when it is embedded into cultural, behavioural and
process norms it is potentially one of the most valuable ways to develop a
true learning organization.
Stories from the frontline
John Coleman, agility transformation consultant, coach and trainer:
Using agile processes, and bringing people on journey
Even if a client has bought into the significance of more agile working,
it’s still important to ask ‘why agility?’. It’s critical that the organization
understands what it will gain from being more agile, and yet there will often
92 Velocity
be different answers to this question, especially from different levels of the
business. Senior support for the adoption of new working methods, values
and behaviours is key, and it’s important to address the ‘what’s in it for me?’
question, so that everyone understands the value.
Benefit will be derived from faster delivery, being more customer
focused and innovative, but this needs to be brought to life at a personal,
team and organizational level. People need to feel like they co-designed the
agility transformation that is to come, since this will help get them through
the times when change feels particularly difficult. And there will be difficult
times, since most transformation efforts require a number of ‘J-curves’19
to get there. The initial stages of change may well create a period of
disruption that can have a short-term adverse impact on performance,
before the tangible benefits start to show and long-term gains become
apparent. So people need to be aware of where they are on the J-curve,
and the fact that there may well be multiple J-curves along the journey.
Once the goal of the first J-curve (no longer than 12 months) is agreed,
it’s important to then work out the best options to achieve the positive
expected outcome at the end of the first curve, and to position yourself as
best you can for the second curve. Tools such as the DICE® framework
from the Boston Consulting Group20 are useful in being able to better
predict outcomes since it uses four key elements to assess likely results:
the duration of the project (longer projects that are reviewed more
frequently are often more likely to succeed than shorter ones that are
subject to a poor review process); the integrity of the team (quality, skills,
capability and configuration); the commitment to change (visible top-down
support, engagement at different levels); and the effort of stakeholders
(degree of additional demands, which should be as minimal as possible).
The key is then to select a toolbox of methods that best suit the current
context, to set the cadence and synchronization pattern that enable
regular delivery of value and the mapping of the interventions needed to
achieve the medium-term outcomes, to keep your sights on generating
early benefit and managing risk, and also ‘Black Swan Farming’21 (the
potential to discover features in hindsight that are hundreds or thousands
of times more valuable than other features). There are probably several
deal breakers, including the acceptance of a half-hearted implementation
(‘WaterScrumFall’ or ‘WAgile’ for example), a lack of appetite for
continuous integration and automated testing, and a lack of appetite
for suitable finance support and processes (more regular forecasting/

The agile
innovation process
In the agile business innovation is not only continuous, its pace is relentless.
As we discussed in Part One, today’s version of Joseph Schumpeter’s ‘gale
of creative destruction’ involves the rapid disintermediation of industries,
the unbundling and rewiring of competitive advantage, and burgeoning
imbalances in talent. The required response is as broad as it is deep. An
agile innovation process requires businesses to be adept at all three stages of
Schumpeter’s model for technological change: Invention (ideas); Innovation
(‘the development of new ideas into marketable products and processes’
or in other words commercialization); and Diffusion (scaling or adoption).
These innovation cycles need to be expedited so that they operate in months,
not years, generating a continuous flow of new experiments and initiatives.
Empowering invention
Ideas from anywhere
Creativity and innovation is often considered to be driven by the recombination
of previously disparate and unconnected ideas and concepts in new
ways. Professor Andrew Hargadon (Professor of Technology Management,
UC Davis Graduate School of Management) has described what he calls
‘technology brokering’,1 which exploits the social elements within the innovation
process and the connections between people, as a way in which
people and organizations can apply existing ideas and technologies in new
ways by bridging the gaps between existing networks from disparate and
potentially distant divisions and even industries. New networks can then be
created that can support these creative recombinations.
This concept of empowering new connections combined with a relentless
throughput of new ideas is foundational to the innovation process in the
truly agile business. Most organizations are pretty bad at harvesting and
nurturing great ideas from their employees. Despite its shortcomings, the
07
95
96 Velocity
practice of brainstorming has become so entrenched within organizational
behaviour that it is often the unquestioned default protocol for the origination
of new ideas and strategy. Such sessions, alongside the convention of
the board or team strategy day, often compartmentalize creativity, boxing
the formation of ideas and strategy into a small window of time. And yet, as
Diehl and Stroebe wrote in 1991:2
Brainstorming groups produce more ideas than an individual but fewer and
poorer quality ideas than from individuals working separately. In other words,
brainstorms dilute the sum of individual efforts.
One of the original rules for brainstorming, first popularized in the 1950s by
Alex Faickney Osborn in the book Applied Imagination,3 focuses on quality
through quantity. It works on the assumption that the more ideas that
are generated, the more likely a radical and effective solution will be found.
Yet as Keith Sawyer, a psychologist at Washington University, has pointed
out4 multiple studies conducted over a number of decades have consistently
shown that brainstorming groups think of far fewer ideas than the same
number of people who work alone and later pool their ideas.
Far better then, to establish a way to continually harvest the best ideas
from your people. The creative process at Pixar is empowered by a collaborative
culture that combines tight team working with an ‘ideas from anywhere’
approach. Ed Catmull, President of Pixar, talks about how (since the creative
process behind their films involves thousands of ideas) the notion of an
idea as a singular thing is a fundamental flaw and instead what is required
is a group behaving creatively. So at Pixar, teams of talented people with
diverse backgrounds are marshalled around a singular vision.
In outlining his vision for how to build a sustainable creative organization,
5 Catmull gives the example of the head of a major Hollywood studio
who told him that his central problem was not finding good people, but
instead finding good ideas. This, he says, is a misguided view of creativity
that views it as a mysterious solo act and reduces products to a single
idea, exaggerating the importance of that initial idea in creating something
original. In reality, any kind of complex product development involves
continuous creativity from a large number of diverse people and disciplines
working effectively together to solve many problems.
In his book on the history of innovation (Where Good Ideas Come
From),6 Steven Johnson talks about how ideas, rather than originating from
lone creative geniuses that have a sudden spark of inspiration, can mature
over time, sometimes laying dormant in the form of ‘partial hunches’ or
half-ideas for years. Since it is the collision of these half-ideas that enables
The agile innovation process 97
breakthroughs to happen, increasing connectivity is the great driver of innovation.
Creating physical and virtual spaces where ideas can mingle is an
effective way that companies can capitalize on this.
As an example, Steve Jobs reportedly designed the Pixar building deliberately
to enable different people to run into each other, believing that the best
meetings are accidental ones (so much so that, as Isaacson wrote about in
his biography of Jobs,7 he positioned the only toilets in the building adjacent
to its large atrium to facilitate people running into each other). Informal,
random interactions between employees are undervalued.
Another of Osborn’s rules for brainstorming focused on the importance
of withholding criticism, in the belief that participants will feel more free to
express unusual ideas. A study from Charlan Nemeth,8 a psychologist from
UC Berkeley, split 265 students into teams of five and gave them 20 minutes
to work on the same problem – how to reduce traffic congestion in the San
Francisco bay area. Each team was randomly assigned to work to one of
three different conditions: one that specified no further rules at all; one that
worked to standard brainstorming rules and emphasized limiting criticism;
and a debate condition in which teams were encouraged to criticize and
debate each other’s ideas. The results for which teams did best were not
even close. While the groups that brainstormed slightly outperformed those
that were given no instructions, the people in the debate condition generated
almost 25 per cent more ideas. When participants were asked later if they
had had any more ideas that had been triggered by the earlier conversation,
those who had been in this latter group produced an average of seven additional
ideas, compared to an average of two from participants in the other
two groups.
So it seems that the ‘do not criticize’ instruction is highly counterproductive.
Every morning at Pixar begins the same way, with the animators
debating the previous day’s work (‘ruthlessly shredding each frame’ as Ed
Catmull describes it) in sessions designed to critique, debate and improve.
As well as encouraging the team to fully engage with the work of others,
the sessions distribute responsibility for catching mistakes across the entire
group, a lesson that Ed Catmull learned from the lean manufacturing
process.
Brainstorming is so inherent to traditional business practice that the
research illustrating its deficiencies seems counterintuitive. Yet truly agile
businesses look far beyond traditional approaches to ideas generation
and begin to facilitate more debate, builds and criticism, and embed creative
approaches and ideas from anywhere in the fabric of how they work
every day.
98 Velocity
‘Porous enterprise’ and the value of fresh perspectives
To encourage the kind of ‘technology brokering’ that Andrew Hargadon
talks about we need to become far more networked as organizations. As
companies become larger and face ongoing challenges, they often become
very inwardly facing. An increasing proportion of time is spent on internal
priorities, managing upwards and company politics. In contrast, being
a networked business means generating an outwardly facing perspective,
and encouraging the flow of fresh thinking, challenges and ideas into and
through the business.
Instead of always focusing on in-sector thinking and examples, fresh
perspectives from unrelated and even distant industries can be uniquely
valuable here. A great example of fresh thinking from another industry
comes from the unlikely combination of a children’s hospital and a Formula
One team. In the surgical and intensive care units of Great Ormond Street
Hospital for Children, doctors knew that improving the 30-minute process
to unplug and untangle (in a crowded space) all the wires and tubes from
patients in order to transfer them from surgery to the ICU could directly
improve patient care. Dr Allan Goldman, the head ICU doctor and Prof
Martin Elliot, heart surgeon, were watching a Formula One race in the
hospital’s staff common room following a 12-hour emergency transplant
operation and noticed how a 20-member Formula One pit crew worked
seamlessly to change the car’s tyres, fill it with petrol, clear the air intakes
and send it away in less than seven seconds.
So they invited the McLaren and Ferrari racing teams to work with them
to identify how their own handover discipline could be more efficient. The
racing technicians’ recommendations focused initially on equipment but
then broadened out into training and process and resulted in a restructuring
of the patient handover procedure, new protocols that detailed who
should be the leader in the process (the anaesthetist) and the exact task of
everyone involved, diagrams that showed exactly where everyone needed to
be positioned around the patient, and rehearsals to make the new processes
as seamless as possible. An industrial psychologist monitored 27 operations
following the adoption of the protocol and found that the number of technical
errors and mistakes in information handover had almost halved.
Encouraging a regular inflow of perspectives however, requires this
kind of thinking at scale. In The Power of Pull,9 the authors John Hagel,
John Seely Brown and Lang Davison coin the phrase ‘porous enterprise’
to describe how networked organizations with externally facing, connected
employees acting as the conduit for new perspectives, focus on the value
The agile innovation process 99
that can be derived from the flow of knowledge into and within a business,
rather than relying on the stocks of knowledge that already exist within its
boundaries and firewalls.
Increasingly, it is the agile, networked business that is best positioned to
originate disruptive concepts and ideas from a broader scope of sources,
perspectives and re-combinations.
The restless, curious organization
We might describe the porous, networked business as a restless, curious
organization – always moving forwards, never being satisfied with the status
quo, constantly exploring and reaching out for the next big idea. We are
too good, as businesses, at compartmentalizing creativity not just into time
segments (like a brainstorming session), but into creative functions, roles
and innovation labs. We are too poor, as businesses, at harvesting, assessing,
and nurturing concepts from wherever and whomsoever they might arise.
Rather than poorly executed, demotivating suggestion schemes, the
creative, curious organization creates an engine of ideation through inclusive,
empowering programmes to originate, harvest and grow new ideas.
Like people, creativity is not one-dimensional. Research by psychologists
Guillaume Fürst, Paolo Ghisletta and Todd Lubart10 has shown that creativity
in individuals requires many different attributes that will often play
different roles at various stages of the process. The research identified three
‘superfactors’ of personality that could predict creativity. These factors
speak to the broader components of a truly effective ideation engine:
1 Plasticity: traits including extraversion, high energy, being open to experience
and inspiration. Whether at an individual or organizational level
there is a high drive for exploration, good levels of curiosity, and a willingness
to experiment and learn at a fast pace.
2 Divergence: non-conformity, and what the researchers termed ‘low agreeableness’.
As people or businesses this is about independence of thought,
a willingness to try new things, to pursue a long-term unique vision even
when questioned, to be stubborn.
3 Convergence: qualities such as precision, persistence, critical sense and
conscientiousness. At an organizational level the discipline to make
robust data-driven decisions to validate ideas and concepts, to focus and
align direction and decision-making on a strong purpose/mission/vision,
to shutter projects and redirect resources towards opportunity when
prudent.
100 Velocity
The research revealed how creativity is about combining both generative
(coming up with lots of original ideas) and selective (being able to critique,
evaluate, and elaborate on ideas effectively) skills. Like design thinking,
business agility is about imagining lots of different possibilities but also
focusing on those that have the most potential value. And it is those that
are able to combine these different behaviours and switch between them in
flexible ways, that are best suited to world in which we now find ourselves.
The creative organization framework
We have created a practical tool for understanding how the creativity of
your own organization maps to the key attributes of agility. Using the
canvas below (Table 7.1), workshop the questions that sit at the intersection
of creativity (plasticity, divergence, convergence) and agility (velocity, focus,
flexibility) to identify areas of strength and weakness.

Innovation is wide, as well as deep
Innovation is often considered in quite one-dimensional ways, and yet it
has never been more important to innovate in a multi-dimensional way.
In their book Ten Types of Innovation11 the authors Larry Keeley, Helen
Walters, Ryan Pikkel and Brian Quinn make the point that while many
executives have traditionally overemphasized the association of innovation
The agile innovation process 101
with the creation of new products and services, the practice of integrating
multiple types of innovation enables organizations to develop offerings that
are highly differentiated, less easy to copy, and that generate higher returns.
Having analysed 2000 successful innovations, they list 10 distinct kinds,
grouped into three key areas:
1 Configuration
a Profit Model: How you make money. Challenging sector conventions
on offering, pricing or revenue generation.
b Network: How you connect with others to create value. Network
innovations enable companies to capitalize on their own strengths
while harnessing the advantage that might be derived from the capabilities
and assets of others.
c Structure: The organization and alignment of talent, resource and
assets. Structure innovations can create unique value or efficiencies.
They can improve productivity and collaboration, help attract talent
to the company and drive performance.
d Process: Developing and implementing unique or superior methods.
Process innovations involve a significant level of change from ‘business
as usual’ that can drive greater capability, adaptability or efficiency.
The development of unique processes can prove difficult for competitors
to access and can yield advantage for extended periods of time.
2 Offering
a Product Performance: the development of distinguishing features and
functionality. This might speak to completely new products, or significantly
improved features, qualities to existing ones.
b Product System: the creation of complementary products and services.
This is concerned with how separate products or services might be
brought together to create new capability or improved scalability.
So things like integration, modularity and interoperability are what
matter. The development of ecosystems that take value from one place
and use it to enhance experience at another is one example.
3 Experience
a Service: supporting and amplifying the value of your offerings.
Enhancing performance, utility and loyalty through improved design
or service provision, fixing customer pain points and helping to ensure
seamless customer journeys. This can elevate the average into the
exceptional, and create a compelling experience.
102 Velocity
b Channel: the way in which your offerings is brought to customers.
Channel innovations are focused on finding new or multiple ways to
bring products and services to users, creating an extraordinary experience
with minimal friction.
c Brand: the representation of your offerings and business. Innovations
in the way that consumers might recognize, recall or associate your
brand, the distinct identity and ‘promise’ of your offering. Often
incorporating multiple customer touchpoints, these can confer value,
meaning and intent to the offering.
d Customer Engagement: fostering compelling interactions. The development
of more meaningful customer connections derived from deep
understanding of customer aspirations, needs and desires. Helping
people to ‘find ways to make parts of their lives more memorable,
fulfilling, delightful – even magical’.
Taking a broader context around innovation opens the organizational
mind toward enabling change that impact not only the outputs (products
and services) but also the infrastructure (networks), relationships (partnerships,
communications), process, structure and resourcing. Too narrow a
consideration of innovation restricts fundamental change and means that
transformation will fail.
Defining the problem to solve
Design thinking, agile and lean are all customer-centric methodologies that
focus on rigorously defining and responding to customer need. Lean practices,
for example, involve removing as many assumptions from a process as
possible, and that includes the question of whether you are actually solving
the right problem in the first place.
A useful framework here is the ‘5 Whys’, a simple yet very effective way
of getting to the root cause of a problem by iteratively asking ‘why’ five
times, each question forming the basis of the next question. It was originally
used by Toyota as a technique for problem solving in their manufacturing
process, and was one of the fundamental techniques in their scientific
approach. Architect of the Toyota Production System, Taiichi Ohno, describes
an example of applying it to a robot stopping:
1 Why did the robot stop? The circuit has overloaded, causing a fuse to blow.
2 Why is the circuit overloaded? There was insufficient lubrication on the
bearings, so they locked up.
The agile innovation process 103
3 Why was there insufficient lubrication on the bearings? The oil pump on
the robot is not circulating sufficient oil.
4 Why is the pump not circulating sufficient oil? The pump intake is clogged
with metal shavings.
5 Why is the intake clogged with metal shavings? Because there is no filter
on the pump.12
Similarly, using the 5 Whys in relation to customer problems or organizational
challenges helps remove assumptions and focus on the real root cause
or issue.
Clay Christensen’s ‘jobs to be done’13 concept is another useful way to
frame customer needs. ‘Jobs to be done’ theorizes that what causes us to
buy a product or service (or indeed a brand) is that we ‘hire’ them to do a
particular job for us. It is a simple idea, but framing it in this way helps us
to understand customer motivations better. Christensen uses an example
of the V8 juice drink that was once marketed to compete with (and in a
similar way to) other soft drinks like Gatorade, using brand attributes like
how refreshing it was. The realization that V8 was being bought instead to
fulfil a different job led to a campaign that focused instead on how the drink
provided the required daily servings of vegetables. Within a year of this decision,
V8 had quadrupled its revenues.
Paul Adams, VP of Product at customer communication platform Intercom
(and ex-Facebook and Google) describes how they apply Christensen’s
framework in the service of product design:
We frame every design problem in a Job, focusing on the triggering event or
situation, the motivation and goal, and the intended outcome:
When _____ , I want to _____ , so I can _____ .
For example: When an important new customer signs up, I want to be notified,
so I can start a conversation with them.14
These kinds of user stories, simple statements about what a customer wants
to do that are framed from their perspective, help ground product development
but also connect wider organizational thinking towards the needs of
the customer.
First principles and 10x thinking
Another way to really focus on breakthrough ideas is through the application
of what Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX and surely
one of the most deeply innovative entrepreneurs today) describes15 as ‘first
104 Velocity
principles’ thinking. In Physics or Mathematics, a first principle16 is ‘a basic,
foundational proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any
other proposition or assumption’.
Musk draws a distinction between the common use of analogy in business
(ideas that are similar to something that already exists) and first principles
thinking (where ‘you boil things down to the most fundamental truths…
and then reason up from there’):17
I think it’s important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. The
normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy. We are doing this
because it’s like something else that was done, or it is like what other people are
doing. Slight iterations on a theme.
While reasoning from analogy can help position new ideas, and potentially
give some comfort that at least some of the elements of the innovation are
founded in existing behaviour or what has worked in the past, it still means
that the starting point incorporates existing assumptions. Solving problems
in entirely new or disruptive ways requires a lot more mental energy but also
starts with the elemental components of a problem and so is far more likely
to result in an entirely unique solution to a problem.
Too often in large organizations, the start point incorporates assumptions
that have built up over time, become embedded in culture or practice
yet have never truly been tested, or that have become outmoded but never
challenged. It is difficult to break out of these assumed constraints when the
prevailing weight of opinion, relationship capital and organizational habits
within a company all act to support them.
In The Game Changer,18 long-time P&G CEO A G Lafley talks about
how business schools tend to focus on inductive thinking (based on directly
observable facts) and deductive thinking (logic and analysis, typically based
on past evidence) whereas design schools emphasize abductive thinking –
imagining what could be possible. There is a good chance that as companies
grow the balance between these three dynamics becomes skewed and we
need to work harder to create more space for abductive thinking.
Google embed what they call ‘10x’ thinking into their innovation process
as a way to avoid overly focusing on incremental and marginal innovation.
At a key stage in the idea generation process the team focus on answering
the question: ‘What’s the 10x version of this idea?’ This forces the team to
re-evaluate their thinking on a wholly different scale to identify if there is an
opportunity for a truly disruptive solution to be created.
Starting from a problem’s most basic elements, and challenging ourselves
in order to re-examine what might be possible can yield very different results.

Ingrained commercialization
Structuring for innovation
The test of a first rate intelligence is to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the

F Scott Fitzgerald
Gary Kasporov, the famous chess grandmaster, once talked about how chess,
like business, is a balance between the mundane and the unthinkable, and
how what separates a winner from a loser at the grand-master level is the
willingness to do the unthinkable, to have the courage to explode the game
and upend your opponent’s thinking:
A brilliant strategy is, certainly, a matter of intelligence, but intelligence without
audaciousness is not enough… So it is in business: One does not succeed by
sticking to convention. When your opponent can easily anticipate every move
you make, your strategy deteriorates and becomes commoditized.
(Kasporov, 2004)19
What Kasporov alludes to is a key business challenge: balancing the need
to deliver and continually improve on day-to-day execution as well as
originate, nurture and grow potentially disruptive and market leading innovations.
When the business is oriented to and focused on delivering steady,
logical, incremental improvement or development within the market, it can
be extremely difficult to have the resource bandwidth, or make room for the
challenging thinking necessary to disrupt the market and get that big leap
over competition.
Key to this is creating the space for breakthrough innovation. Since the
Lockheed Skunk Works came into existence in the 1940s the idea of the
corporate innovation lab has become a dominant way for organizations
to structure innovation. The risks inherent with compartmentalizing innovation
in this way typically lie around a lack of inclusivity and broader
organizational learning. But autonomy and separation can catalyse innovation
and new ways of working, facilitate genuinely different thinking, and
(if resourced properly) prevent early stage ideas from becoming submerged
under the weight of slow-moving corporate culture.
The benefits can be multi-dimensional. Research by Cap Gemini among
large-scale corporates revealed six key goals for innovation outposts:
accelerating
the speed of innovation, providing a conduit for fresh
ideas, enhancing risk-taking ability, attracting talent, driving employee

engagement, and helping to foster a culture of innovation.20 Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs Steve Blank and Evangelos Simoudis describe a typical threestage
development of innovation centres, each needing a clearly defined set
of objectives and the right team to match them. The first stage involves
networking and partnering, to actively ‘sense’ innovation and keep pace
with technology development. For example, Silicon Valley outposts established
by car manufacturers such as BMW and Mercedes to track and engage
with self-driving car and other technologies. The second stage moves into
inventing, investing, incubating, and acquiring technologies and companies
(requiring venture capital or mergers and acquistions capability) in focused,
relevant areas. The third stage involves building products, or ‘productizing
the solution to corporate problems’.
As an example, Walmart Labs (‘We’re not a retailer competing in Silicon
Valley. We’re building an internet technology company inside the world’s
largest retailer’), was created when Walmart acquired Silicon Valley technology
business Kosmix. Instead of swallowing the early stage business into the
corporate machine they created Walmart Labs,21 with a mission to redefine
e-commerce globally, and in doing so drive the wider organizational capability
in digital and mobile commerce. As well as developing a series of new
platforms and applications for the mother brand (it is claimed that the internal
search engine they developed drove a 20 per cent increase in online sales
conversions), Walmart Labs has now acquired over 14 startups.
Other corporates choose to create ‘catalyst brands’ that are given the
freedom to work in different ways to create progressive impetus. In 2013
British Gas launched the Hive Active Heating brand with a mission to make
the connected home a reality for everyone. The team use lean startup methodology
to keep product development close to customer need, software is
built though agile methods so that small bite-sized chunks can be delivered
iteratively. In two years their first product, a connected thermostat became
the number one such product in the UK with over 200,000 connected home
customers.22
The Unilever Foundry is a good example of an incubator established by a
corporate with a vision for innovators to connect with its brands. Housed in
a separate building, the objective is to build and cultivate strategic partners
for the future, with Unilever as a partner of choice. As well as office space,
Unilever offer mentoring to develop brand and marketing propositions and
roadmaps, they run regular hack events focus on Unilever specific briefs,
and operate a crowdsourcing platform focused on the company’s sustainability
challenges. Regular involvement of Unilever staffers in initiatives helps
ensure that fresh thinking disseminates more broadly across the company.
The agile innovation process 107
The Unilever Foundry, Hive and Walmart Labs are three different examples
of how large organizations are creating the space to originate and
nurture competing business models in the business at the same time. The
real benefit comes when innovation labs are resourced in such a way to
make them sufficiently autonomous to have the freedom to develop potentially
disruptive concepts and work in new ways, yet integrated enough that
it can more inclusively act to champion that new way of working and help
disseminate different thinking more widely in the business. They are effective
at hothousing new approaches and new ways of working, but it is only
when these broaden out more widely than the innovation lab, that real,
fundamental change can happen.
The entrepreneurial function
Companies are generally not short on ideas. A greater challenge lies in the
harvesting, selection, nurturing and then scaling of these new concepts.
A focused innovation lab can be a powerful conduit to introduce new ways
of working to an organization and originate step-change ideas. Running
working processes in that unit that are based around design thinking,
agile and lean can not only improve innovation tempo but also enable the
progressive understanding of value.
As ideas are iterated on following an overarching strategic vision but
using customer feedback to inform the development priorities, value
becomes emergent and organizational risk is mitigated. Companies have
the opportunity to explore, test and learn rapidly to validate, and establish
early stage products that are already being used by real customers. Instead
of untested products emerging from the innovation lab and landing in the
wider business, which is then expected to commercialize and scale them,
this enables the opportunity for products to become established at an earlier
stage with an early adopter audience. Even products that will eventually
scale to millions of users should begin with a small market. Facebook, for
example, began as a service limited to Harvard students before being opened
up to other colleges in the Boston area, Ivy League institutions, and then
most universities in Canada and the United States. This requires a change
in corporate mindset. As PayPal founder Peter Thiel wrote in his book Zero
to One:23
This is why successful network businesses rarely get started by MBA types: the
initial markets are so small that they often don’t even appear to be business
opportunities at all.
108 Velocity
Yet still the move of an early stage product from the innovation lab into the
wider business presents a key challenge. A concept might have been rigorously
tested and developed in the lab but then it is given to a manager who is
not necessarily as invested in it as those who have been on the journey from
the beginning and sees it as additive to their already challenging commitments.
Worse, the early stage product is shackled with short-term targets
and forecasts, and dropped into business as usual where it becomes victim to
organizational silos and the drag-brake of bureaucracy. Eric Ries describes
this as akin to moving from science to astrology, and suggests that there is
a missing function of entrepreneurship in many companies – staff who are
responsible for taking ideas out of the lab and have the ability, incentives,
time and space to commercialize them, who can manage the process from
concept to execution using a disciplined, systematic way of testing new ideas
and developments.
The shackling of early stage products with forecasts and targets can
contaminate development priorities (you build the feature that you think
will make you money rather than the feature that the customer really wants)
and eventually strangle the project as it struggles to hit forecasts that often
have little foundation in reality. Critical to this stage in a product lifecycle,
therefore, is the ability to show progression of value towards the ultimate
desired outcome – revenue and profit. Eric Ries’s concept of innovation
accounting that we discussed earlier is one way of framing this. Another
useful framework comes from Silicon Valley entrepreneur and angel investor
Dave McClure.
Pirate Metrics
Steve Blank has described how a startup is effectively ‘an organization built
to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.24 An early stage
product, therefore, might be considered to be a product searching for a
market. Tools such as the Value Proposition Canvas,25 and Lean Canvas26
are excellent frameworks for establishing product-market fit in early stage
products. Yet while revenue is the desired ultimate outcome, the most important
objective in the early stages of a product lifecycle is to acquire learning,
and so solely using revenue as a measure of success can be distracting and
less than helpful.
Dave McClure’s Pirate Metrics27 defines a set of macro metrics that can
be used to model the customer lifecycle. While revenue may be one of them,
it is not the only one. Pirate Metrics is a sequential 5 metric-model (A-A-R-R-R)
designed to represent all of the key behaviours of customers – how many
The agile innovation process 109
users you are acquiring, how many of them are active users, whether they
come back and use it again, whether they tell others about it, and how much
money you are able to derive from them. To paraphrase:
●● Acquisition: What are the ways in which your users become aware of
you? What is the rate of customer acquisition?
●● Activation: How many acquired users actually use/subscribe? What is the
activation rate?
●● Retention: How many activated users come back and use the product/
service again? What is the retention rate?
●● Revenue: How much money do you make from user activity?
●● Referral: How many users refer other users, or advocate your product/
service? What is the referral rate?
These help to define and measure customer value before you actually start
capturing some of that value back. In other words they are leading indicators
to revenue before actual revenues are realized. And in this sense they can
also be used to hold entrepreneurs, and the leaders of innovation projects,
accountable. It is a simple model, yet shows the need for flexibility right
across an organization if innovation is to succeed.
Scaling, the digital-native way
Large businesses are very comfortable with scale and yet paradoxically
some of the best lessons we can learn about scale can come from when we
don’t have it. For example, the restraint needed to start small, and then get
bigger can force us to make difficult prioritization choices and be ruthless
about finding the right customer problem to solve. The process of solving
a key problem for (and ultimately dominating) a niche market can create
indispensable learning that can itself be scaled. The pivot can enable us to
make transformational decisions about product features that then catalyse
user adoption. Instagram, for example, began life as a multi-featured checkin
app called Burbn but when that became too similar to other offerings
in the market the founders pivoted to focus purely on mobile photo sharing
(founder Kevin Systrom said of the pivot: ‘We decided that if we were
going to build a company, we wanted to focus on being really good at
one thing’).28
Brian Chesky, founder and CEO of AirBnB tells the story of how Paul
Graham (founder of startup incubator Y Combinator) gave them a piece
110 Velocity
of advice that changed their trajectory – how one of the keys to get to scale
is to do things that don’t scale, or in other words how it is better to have a
hundred people who love what you do, rather than one million who simply
like what you do.29
Then, as a product or service grows beyond its initial customers and
offering, the challenge becomes focused on iterating or pivoting the product
offering while still following the ambitious long-term vision. Amazon may
have always had a vision to dominate digital retail, but Jeff Bezos very deliberately
started with books. So, as Peter Thiel says in Zero To One:
Sequencing markets correctly is underrated, and it takes discipline to expand
gradually. The most successful companies make the core progression – to first
dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets – a part of their
founding narrative.
If one of the key questions is when to scale the answer has to be only when
it is right to scale. When your key measures tell you that you are solving real
customer problems and your users really care about your product. Then you
scale as fast as possible.
Using network effects
Similar to what we now know as network effects, Metcalfe’s Law originated
in 1980s as a way to express the concept that a network enabled
by communications technologies becomes exponentially more valuable
as more devices are connected to it. In the 1990s this was expressed as
the value of a network being proportional to the square of the number
of users connected to that system. A simple example of Metcalfe’s Law
might be the telephone. If just two telephones existed, that would be of
minor use. But as more telephones are added to the network the number
of people who can talk to each other using that technology increases,
meaning that the value of every telephone increases as the number of
connections rise.
Similarly in the internet era, network effects describes the simple but
potentially very powerful idea that the more nodes, users or connected
points that there are in a network, the more powerful that network becomes.
So, like the telephone, the greater the number of users that are using a social
network, the more valuable that network becomes to every user. Products
that scale using network effects get better and better the more people use
it, creating a virtuous circle of growth. Marketing is effectively baked into
the product.
The agile innovation process 111
The power of open ecosystems, growth hacking
and APIs
Restraints are often the drivers of creativity. Being open is often the route to
scale. David Weinberger, one of the co-authors of The Cluetrain Manifesto,
once described the web as ‘small pieces, loosely joined’.
APIs are sets of functions, protocols, procedures and tools that enable
developers to access the features or data of another service or application.
Thousands of APIs exist, connecting thousands of different services and
providing an enormously powerful range of easily accessible data sources
and building blocks for digital services. There are two ways in which APIs
can enable and accelerate growth. Utilizing third-party data via an API can
give you access to rich sources of intelligence and data on which can be built
services of all kinds. Secondly, if data is a raw material of digital innovation,
creating your own API and opening up key parts of your data to third
parties can dramatically increase the resource allocated to creating new
concepts and services from that raw material. APIs can facilitate not only
scale but also new connections between services and companies, creating a
networked ecosystem in which value flows as fast as the data.
Open systems and platform business models can create enormous value
for both hosts and participants through empowering co-creation or facilitating
an exchange of value of some kind. Reducing transaction costs and
empowering new forms of collaboration enables businesses to scale in
entirely new ways. Apple and Google have created billions of dollars of
value for both developers and their own businesses through opening up
their respective app stores in the same way as the integration of APIs at
launch into countless services has catalysed growth, enhanced value propositions
and reinforced innovation.
Yet APIs, open-source, peer-to-peer models, and hacking growth require
a different kind of thinking. In the early days of AirBnB, the founders were
struggling to create critical mass on both sides of the platform – listings
and renters. A traditional approach by a larger business would focus on
marketing and advertising, yet the AirBnB founders were severely limited
in funding. So they automated a process that when people listed their property
on the site it also proposed that they publish it with only one click on
Craigslist.com linking back to the original listing. This hack enabled them
to leverage the enormous scale that Craigslist had in order to drive their
own growth.30
Growth hacking describes the process for acquiring and retaining users
that combines traditional marketing and analytical skills with those more
112 Velocity
akin to product development (including test and learn, optimizing successes,
discarding dead ends). Its purpose is to drive user growth, particularly in the
context of establishing critical user mass and enabling a service to then capitalize
on network effects. In their early days Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn
and Quora all employed people to hack their growth.
The concept of growth hacking crosses the divide between marketing
and product development teams, utilizing an understanding about how
your users discover and adopt your products to build features that will help
acquire and retain more users, so making the spending of marketing budget
a lot more joined up with the building of product features and vice versa.
So it mixes engineering with marketing, combining product management,
data science and traditional marketing skills. It is less focused on buying
attention in order to drive awareness and interest and more on creating
rich and appealing experiences for users. So it is about getting to points of
sustainable growth, understanding what the data is telling you about the
core patterns from your more active and passionate users, how they became
more active, and then building sustainable features and experiences that
can help continuously attract new users, and encourage them to be active as
quickly as possible.
Well-known growth hacker Josh Elman gives some good examples of
how growth hacking can add real value to scaling. Attempting to artificially
generate growth, he says, may create spiky numbers but rarely
adds long-term value (‘It’s kind of like eating empty calories’).31 He gives
the example of when he worked with Twitter in the early days and how
their core challenge was not acquiring users, but getting people who had
just signed up to the service to come back and use it regularly. A typical
marketing response to this problem would be CRM-based, or re-targeting
users with display advertising. Yet when they looked at the analytics
around user behaviour they realized that if as a new user you manually
selected and followed at least five accounts on the service when you signed
up, you were far more likely to return. Rebuilding the on-boarding process
and early user experience on Twitter led to a dramatic improvement in
retention.
Fluid resourcing
APIs and platform business models are examples of how organizations
can move quickly to generate scale and respond to shifting scenarios. In
the networked world data and value flow easily between entities in the
The agile innovation process 113
ecosystem but as we discussed in Part One, businesses that operate in the
networked era also require a high degree of fluidity in resourcing.
As Rita Gunther McGrath asserts (in The End of Competitive Advantage),
if sustainable competitive advantage is shifting to a series of transient
advantages then you need to organize your company in a very different
way. Towards a strategy of continuous reconfiguration, and orienting the
company around being responsive to opportunity rather than simply focusing
on efficiency and optimization. McGrath gives the example in her book
of Infosys, who reorganize the company every two or three years in order
to avoid systemic resistance to changing the way of working.
Rather than extreme downsizing or restructuring, increased fluidity in
resourcing brings greater manoeuvrability. While innovation labs can be a
great way to hothouse early stage ideas and introduce and catalyse new ways
of working, the ultimate goal is to reorient the wider organization around
continuous learning, increased velocity, flexibility and structural adaptivity.
In educational theory active learning is a well-known method of schooling
in which participants learn through active involvement, experience or
doing. In machine learning this is extended to become a type of iterative
supervised learning in which a learning algorithm might interact with or
query a user or data source in order to obtain improved outputs. But the
clue is in the moniker – the key word is ‘active’. Organizations may well
have digital training programmes that go beyond specialist digital expertise
to impact the wider organization. They may even have reverse mentoring
or accreditation schemes. But if we are to put any credence in the wellestablished
70/20/10 model for learning and development32 which posits
that 70 per cent of development is derived from on-the job experiences
(actually working on tasks and problems), 20 per cent from interaction
and feedback, and 10 per cent from formal training and reading, then by
far the greatest individual (and surely therefore organizational) learning
comes from active learning: direct hands-on experience and proximity to
new ways of working. Key to developing learning and transformation at
scale, therefore, is how we extend these new ways of working beyond the
innovation lab. How employees from the wider organization might interact
with, cycle through, or work alongside the lab and how the new thinking
and methodologies might then disseminate wider, and scale beyond the
innovation unit.
In Part Four we will consider this broader context of agile resourcing,
and some challenging but practical ways in which organizations can structure
for manoeuvrability.
114 Velocity
Key takeouts
This Part has been focused on bringing to the organization a new level
manoeuvrability and responsiveness, a new tempo of innovation, and a new
way of working to empower continuous adaptive learning in response to
our complex adaptive environment. Some key takeouts include:
1 Have a view on the maturity of your business model. As an exercise,
gather the senior team together and get an agreed view on where you
believe your organization is on the current ‘S-curve’?
2 Create the space for experimentation
a Find ways to free up time to dedicate to new thinking, ideation, nurturing
early stage ideas, and embed this in cultural norms
b Orient resourcing around embedded test and learn. Review and
balance the allocation of resourcing towards core business (optimization,
efficiency), expansion (extending propositions, related markets),
and breakthrough (new territory, high risk)
c Assess the cultural and corporeal appetite for risk, experimentation
and breakthrough innovation
3 Use digital-native processes such as agile, lean and design thinking to
increase the scope, scale and tempo of exploration and experimentation
4 Develop a true learning culture in the organization
a Embed reflection time and the practice of retrospectives in working
processes
b Encourage learning from failures as well as successes – celebrate the
learning, not the failure
c Encourage an organizational growth mindset that relishes challenge as
an opportunity to learn – lead by example from the top, set expectations,
ask the right questions
5 Create an agile innovation engine
a Empower invention: take ideation out of organizational silos and
time blocks; maximize the collision of half ideas through physical
and virtual spaces; encourage networked employees and the flow of
knowledge to empower innovation at the edges; reward exploring
behaviours, independence of thought and willingness to try the new;
challenge innovation efforts to be broad as well as deep; work hard
on finding the real problems to solve then use first principles and 10x
The agile innovation process 115
thinking to explode the idea; validate continuously with customers
and data
b Embed rapid commercialization: use innovation labs, catalyst brands
or incubation programmes to hothouse new ways of working as well
as early stage ideas; protect early stage concepts as they move from
labs to business-as-usual through entrepreneur roles and value driven
metrics
c Scale the digital-native way: focus on network effects, open ecosystems,
platform business models, growth hacking and APIs; encourage
active ‘learning-by-doing’ as a way to disseminate new ways of thinking
and working at scale wider through the organization

Part three
Focus
This Part deals with the importance of vision, direction, strategy, and focus
in accelerating pace and creating organizational momentum.
Focus – Progress and momentum towards a distinct direction, clarity of
definition, the centre of activity, to pay attention to, to adapt to the surrounding
conditions to be able to see clearly.
Innovation without Execution is hallucination.
Thomas Edison
Defining focus
Every company wants to move faster. To develop and progress at pace. In
Part One we made the case for velocity to be framed in the context of a new
kind of agility, responsiveness and manoeuvrability. Yet velocity without
focus is foolish. As Peter Drucker said:
There is nothing quite so useless, as doing with great efficiency, something that
should not be done at all.
Focus is a ubiquitous concept in business, but rarely applied well. Steve
Jobs’ biographer Walter Isaacson tells the story of how after Jobs returned
to the business in 1997 he was faced with a confused but ample lineup of
hardware and peripherals. After numerous product review sessions he had
reached the end of his tether and shouted for them to stop. Grabbing a Magic
Marker, he went to the whiteboard and drew a two-by-two grid, labelling
the columns ‘consumer’ and ‘pro’, and the rows ‘desktop’ and ‘portable’. He
then told his team that their focus should be on building four great products,
one for each quadrant, Everything else should be cancelled.1
One can only imagine the bewilderment of the execs in the meeting, but
in implementing ruthless focus Jobs saved the business. As he later said to
119
120 Focus
his biographer Walter Isaacson: ‘Deciding what not to do is as important
as deciding what to do’. Thereafter on Apple senior management retreats
he would have the management team list out their top 10 priorities for the
coming year, then he would stand up and cross-out the bottom seven on the
list and declare that they could only do three.
While we can increase the tempo of innovation and progress through
continuous exploration and experimentation, we need a strong, focused
vision to create a distinct direction, even if we are then adaptive in our
progression towards it.
In this part we reference Amazon a number of times, but for good reason.
Few businesses have been quite so adept at maintaining a ruthless focus on
a long-term vision (‘We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company
for four primary customer sets: consumers, sellers, enterprises, and content
creators’) while also preserving another important context for focus within
the agile business: that of continuous improvement. Author Matthew Syed
(in Bounce)2 analysed the factors that determine exceptional success among
sporting professionals and concluded that while natural talent and genetic
make up do make a difference, the most powerful characteristic exhibited
by outstanding performers in sport (and also in other areas) was what he
called ‘sustained purposeful practice’.
This kind of purposeful practice involves deliberately focusing in a
sustained way on the problem areas, things that need correcting, fixing or
improving. Science writer Joshua Foer has used the example of musicians to
make the same point:
When most musicians sit down to practice, they play the parts of pieces that
they’re good at. Of course they do: It’s fun to succeed. But expert musicians
tend to focus on the parts that are hard, the parts they haven’t yet mastered.’3
Constant application of deliberate practice, focused specifically on improving
performance, coupled with the growth mindset that we discussed in Part
Two, lead to world-class achievement. Iterative sprint working with in-built
reflection time is the organizational form of deliberate practice. Constant,
repeated focus reflecting on feedback, defining and solving customer or
business problems, or improving ways of working, forms an iterative loop
of purposeful practice, and creates its own kind of momentum.
Increased pace may be our desired goal, and a sense of urgency may help
to create a reason for change, but it is focus that brings momentum towards
a distinct direction. Put simply:
Velocity × Focus = Momentum
Defining focus 121
Momentum is what creates a real impetus for change. It is what creates a
highly motivating environment in which to work. And adaptive momentum
is what creates real competitive advantage and enables you to win.
The wrong side of urgency – Nokia’s story
One of the foundational elements of any change process is, of course, to
create the reason and urgency for change. Without this, transformation
does not even get started. It is the first stage in John Kotter’s famous eightstep
process for leading change4 (which we will come back to in Part Five).
In this Part we will be discussing the importance of not only organizational
pace and manoeuvrability but also generating momentum through a
heightened organizational cadence, tempo and rhythm. Creating a sense of
urgency helps establish a compelling imperative for change and continued
momentum, and can bring focus through prioritization in combining what
is important with what requires immediate attention (in much the same way
as an importance/urgency prioritization would help create better to do lists
in our own time management).
Yet it is essential to draw that urgency from the right place. The story of
Nokia’s decline is grand testament. Research and analysis (based on an internal
perspective from interviews with both senior and mid-level executives
and engineers as well as an external one from experts) conducted by Quy
Huy, a professor of strategic management at INSEAD, and Timo Vuori, assistant
professor at Aalto University in Finland,5 reveals that rather than the
complacency and ignorance to which Nokia’s innovation and competitive
failures are usually attributed, an organizational culture that at the time was
dominated by a climate of fear was instrumental in the company’s downturn.
The research indicates that, during the time in question, temperamental
leaders created an environment that made it very hard to pass bad news back
up the line. The fear that senior management had of the external environment
and of not reaching their quarterly targets in a highly performance-driven
culture seemingly impacted the treatment of their subordinates, making
those middle managers fearful of disappointing the top executives. This
‘froze coordination’ between senior and middle management to the point
where the latter over-promised, remained silent or even directly lied to the
former in order to avoid being told that they were not ambitious enough to
meet the stretched goals set for them.
The result was a company-wide inertia. Everyone realized that Nokia
needed a better operating system for its phones in order to respond to
122 Focus
the threat posed by Apple. But middle management, fearful of appearing
defeatist and of the reaction of their bosses, avoided publicly admitting the
inferiority of Symbian (their own operating system), and the culture led to
a ‘decoupling of perceptions’ between the two groups of top and middle
managers about how quickly Nokia could match the iPhone.
This shared fear was exacerbated by a culture of status inside Nokia that
equated resources with power. This made everyone want to retain status
in order to prevent resources being allocated elsewhere, or to avoid being
marginalized by being perceived to be not ambitious enough or willing
enough to take on challenging projects or targets. Over-promising became
a route to securing more resources, which in turn was perceived as an
increase in status. This was not helped by a lack of senior technical competency
(at Apple, many of the top brass are engineers), which in turn meant
poor assessment of feasibility in relation to goal setting. A disproportionate
amount of focus and resources were therefore dedicated towards developing
new devices to fulfil short-term market demands at the expense of what was
really required – the development of a new operating system.
The conclusion from the authors is that leaders, and particularly those
required to lead transformation (and which leader doesn’t fall into that
category right now?), need to be able to identify ‘varied collective emotions’
and develop a collective ‘emotional capability’ in their companies. In other
words to be really sensitive to the emotional fallout and resultant impact of
the culture within their organization:
While modest fear might be healthy for motivation, using it indiscriminately can
be like overusing a drug, which risks generating harmful side effects… Fear can
only be a useful motivator if management can provide workers with the means
to address these fears.
A positively focused urgency can create real impetus for change but a negatively
focused one might overemphasize inputs and action at the expense
of outputs. Valuing action over results can lead to shortcuts, micromanagement,
declines in proactivity, a reduction in signal vs noise, and a danger
that we might value short-term gain over long-term vision.

The role
of vision
and purpose
The organizing idea, purpose and vision
At the most basic level digital transformation requires setting a new course.
A course that everyone can understand, grasp, get excited about. As we will
demonstrate in Part Five, defining an ‘organizing idea’, an overarching statement
or principle which defines the fundamental orientation for the business,
or what drives the company at its most elemental level can express this new
direction at the simplest and highest level. But beyond this we need to define
the vision and purpose that can truly catalyse organizational momentum and
bring this idea to life. Mapping purpose, mission, vision and values requires
great clarity. Organization design consultancy NOBL has a useful framework
that captures the subtle but important differences in definition.1 To paraphrase:
●● Purpose: This is defined as ‘why you choose to exist together, beyond
financial gain’, and will usually start with the phrase: ‘We believe…’
●● Mission: The mission represents ‘an ambitious yet achievable position in
the market or in your customers’ lives that recognizes your purpose’. It is
important therefore that this makes it clear what business you are in, and
can often start with the phrase ‘Be the most…’
●● Vision: A company’s vision moves beyond its purpose in expressing ‘the
difference you’ll create in your customers’ lives or the larger world when
you ultimately realize your purpose’. The vision should be compelling to
those both inside and outside the company, and might well begin with the
phrase: ‘We will…’
●● Values: Organizational values are ‘the principles and values that will
accelerate your progress together’. These may be succinct and easy to
remember, but will often be represented with a verb (eg ‘Be committed’).
08
125
126 Focus
●● Measures: Often not included in a purpose statement, measures can be the
‘things that you can observe that indicate progress, forward or backward’,
and a useful way to bring the purpose, vision, mission and values to life.
Reading the mission statements of the largest companies in the world reveals
many that are vague platitudes to shareholder value, customer-centricity,
responsibility and competitive advantage. Substituting the name of the
company in the statement demonstrates that many of them could apply to
any number of large businesses. The most compelling missions are energizing
and ambitious, have a clarity, simplicity and uniqueness, but also sit alongside
clearly expressed goals, beliefs, character and a reason for being. The most
compelling visions provide not only a strong sense of direction but also a motivating
clarion call for the best talent, the expectation to shape behaviours, and
so enables the basis to move fast. And they need to come from the very top.
Stories from the frontline
Marco Ryan, EVP, Chief Digital Officer, Wartsila Corporation (and digital
transformation veteran): If the CEO is not the sponsor, pack up and go
home
I’ve had the privilege to lead two full-scale digital transformations as well
as to design or influence nearly eight others over the last 15 years. All too
often CEOs do not want to risk the disruption that digital transformation
can cause, to be on their watch. They need their time at the helm to
be characterized by profitable growth, increased dividends and the
achievement of their Long-term incentive Plan trigger price.
But digital transformation is so fundamental to an organization’s future
success, that if it is not something the CEO sponsors, you should be
worried. Worried enough to walk. This is not to say that CEOs have to do
the heavy lifting. That’s what Chief Digital Officers are for. But they should
be confident enough and smart enough to realize they do not have the time
or the skills and hire someone that has.
But after that individual is hired, it cannot be ‘Box ticked. Job done.’
Digital transformation needs the CEO to ensure his direct reports
understand the priorities, act with one voice, demonstrate leadership to
the organization and prioritize some of the talent and resources to support
what is, in effect, a complete remodelling of the business model. It is in
effect a leadership issue. It starts at the very top. With the CEO.
The role of vision and purpose 127
The link between purpose and profit
Renowned management consultant and author Peter Drucker once famously
said:
The purpose of business is to create and keep a customer.
But he also said:
That business purpose and business mission are so rarely given adequate
thought is perhaps the most important cause of business frustration and failure.
The agile business is characterized by a visionary purpose, but one that is
strongly connected to strategy and execution. This is not a new idea, of
course. Over a decade ago Jim Collins and Jerry Porras demonstrated (in
Built to Last,2 which was based on a six-year Stanford University research
project looking at 18 exceptional and enduring companies) that companies
that were guided by a visionary purpose beyond just making money
returned six times more to shareholders between 1926 and 1990 than their
explicitly profit-driven competitors.
A more recent survey from a team from at Harvard Business Review
Analytics and EY’s Beacon Institute (called The Business Case for Purpose)3
found that companies that can harness the power of purpose to drive performance
enjoy a significant competitive advantage.
But there was another interesting finding to the research about what
happens when that purpose is not clear, or the link between purpose and
action not explicit: 90 per cent of respondents in the HBR/EY study said
that their company understood the importance of purpose yet less than half
thought that it ran in a purpose-driven way. A lack of clarity on organizational
purpose, or how it is expressed (or how that translates into action)
can mean that it is impossible to measure, properly manage, or even to learn
and improve in the journey towards it. And what is the result of having no
clear overriding purpose other than profit?
In a subtle alchemical shift, the metrics fill the vacuum, muscling out any wider
purpose with the imperative of hitting the numbers. This transposition of ends
and means is often disastrous because methods, now geared to meeting the
metric, are detached from customer purpose – so banks sell payment protection
insurance to people who do not need it, or VW managers manipulate emissions
readings to meet targets. Look no further for the reason why companies lose
their customer focus.
128 Focus
Clay Christensen characterizes a company’s purpose as comprising three parts:
1 Likeness (the vision of the company they want to become)
2 Commitment (the focus to get there)
3 Metrics (the measures of success).
It must be deliberately conceived, chosen and pursued but when that is in place
how the company progresses towards that purpose is likely to be emergent.
Hundreds of thousands of words have been written about the importance
of purpose in business, yet there are specific reasons why this matters more
than ever. A powerful purpose empowers velocity and focus, since everyone
knows the direction in which to head, and it supports fast decision-making
and autonomy. At the macro level it creates a calling that employees, new
talent, customers and investors can get behind (VC Ben Horowitz describes
how: ‘The story of the company goes beyond quarterly or annual goals and
gets to the hard-core question of why… why is the world better off as a
result of this company’s existence?’).4 At the micro level it removes unnecessary
questions and informs group and team strategies and tactics.
Organizational purpose shapes company culture, and seeps into product
design and customer experience. A strong purpose enables change to be
framed as a choice or presented as a point of view (rather than a response
to an existential threat) which in turn empowers the kind of ideas that don’t
only originate great products but also create new categories. A point of view
sets the foundation for change (as the authors of Play Bigger5 describe it,
a point of view: ‘has to shift people’s minds so they reject an old way of
thinking and come to believe in something new. It has to reach people on an
emotional level’). Above all, a strong purpose enables the whole company to
move at speed towards a commonly understood, long-term, ambitious vision.
Taking the long view
In his famous letter to Amazon shareholders in 19976 (when the company
was only two years old), founder Jeff Bezos outlined his belief that a fundamental
measure of success for Amazon would be the shareholder value that
they could create over the long term, and how as a result this may mean that
they would make decisions differently from other companies:
We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market
leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or
short-term Wall Street reactions.
The role of vision and purpose 129
It is a philosophy that in itself proved to have longevity for the company. In
a 2011 interview with Steven Levy in Wired, Bezos said that when everything
you are working on is to a three-year horizon, then you are inevitably
competing against a lot of people. But since few companies are willing
to invest on a longer time horizon, doing this dramatically reduces the
competition:
Just by lengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavors that you
could never otherwise pursue. At Amazon we like things to work in five to seven
years. We’re willing to plant seeds, let them grow – and we’re very stubborn. We
say we’re stubborn on vision and flexible on details.
(Bezos, 2011)7
And in his 2013 letter to shareholders8 he said:
I think long-term thinking squares the circle. Proactively delighting customers
earns trust, which earns more business from those customers, even in new
business arenas. Take a long-term view, and the interests of customers and
shareholders align.
Consequently, Amazon’s revenues have grown exponentially over the long
term, but consistent investment in forward-thinking innovation and infrastructure
to continually develop the company’s capability and scope has
meant that earnings have been minimal. While not every company has the
luxury of ignoring short-term shareholder value, the point is that Amazon
is buying itself the time and space to invest in not only continual, datadriven,
shorter-term marginal improvement, but also large-scale invention.
For that, as Bezos has said, you need to be willing to think long term, to
start with the customer and work backwards, and even to be misunderstood
for lengthy periods of time (as they were when they moved into
hardware with the Kindle). For CEOs with quarterly targets and multiple
pressing priorities this is not easy. And yet, it is more essential than
ever to build the new while optimizing the old. Google CEO Larry Page
believes that the main reason behind many company failures is that they
‘miss the future’:
When I talk to most companies, I do think their leaders are pretty short-term
focused… It’s pretty difficult to solve big problems in four years. I think it’s
probably pretty easy to do it in 20 years. I think our whole system is setup in a
way that makes it difficult for leaders of really big companies.9
Difficult but now critical. The dangers of too much short-termism are akin
to that Clay Christensen idea of planting saplings when you need shade – it
130 Focus
takes time for the saplings to grow big enough. Prioritizing investment into
new sources of revenues only when you need them is too late.
Businesses that work to a long-term horizon have a huge potential
advantage, meaning that companies need to have a point of view on the
future and their part in it, and that the emphasis of corporate strategy itself
is shifting. Author and consultant (and co-founder of the Deloitte Centre
for the Edge Innovation) John Hagel has described this shift in emphasis
from strategies ‘shaped by terrain’ to strategies ‘shaped by trajectory’.
Traditional approaches to strategy are profoundly shaped by the current
landscape. While there are still dynamic components to the strategy (such
as responses to shifts generated by your own or competitor activities), the
starting point is always your current position and the environment that
surrounds it.
While strategies of position still matter, in an environment of accelerating
change and increasing uncertainty we need, says John, more than ever
to have a point of view on the trajectory of change and ‘what degrees of
freedom we might have in shaping these outcomes through our actions’. In
other words to position in the context of the future, not the present. That
point of view needs to look from the future towards the present rather than
the other way round.
Working back from the future in this way enables us to think far more
laterally about our near-term direction and the steps that we need to take now
to achieve the future that we envisage. As an example, Netflix is quite open
about its long-term view on the future of internet TV and what it sees as its
future-facing guideposts, publishing them openly on the web.10 Businesses
are increasingly defined by their futures, not by their pasts. Effective strategies
of trajectory take account of fundamental needs and things that are
stable over time. Back to Jeff Bezos again who believes that if you want to
build a successful, sustainable business, you don’t only ask yourself what
could change in the next 10 years that could affect your company, but more
importantly ask yourself what won’t change, and then put all your energy
and effort into those things.11
To be an agile business, you need to have a point of view on the future.
To not make oversimplified presumptions about what that future could look
like. Strategies of trajectory are not only about what is possible but also
about what could be possible. In order to take a view on that we need to be
paying close attention to underlying shifts in consumer behaviour but also
core customer needs that don’t change, and not simply the latest shiny new
technology.

Agile strategy
and planning
The key to good strategy
… is to have one. As Richard Rumelt noted in his excellent book on strategy
(Good Strategy/Bad Strategy):1
The first natural advantage of good strategy arises because other organizations
often don’t have one. And because they don’t expect you to have one either.
A good strategy has coherence, coordinating actions, policies and resources so
as to accomplish an important end.
Many organizations, says Rumelt, substitute strategy for multiple goals
and initiatives that may symbolize progress, but in reality lack a coherent
approach to actually achieving that progress (apart from, he notes, ‘spend
more and try harder’).
In Part One, we described the key challenge as one characterized by rates
of change: Technological change happens exponentially, but organizational
change is logarithmic. The way in which we might mitigate this potentially
widening gap is through deliberate choices. Yet, as Rotman School of
Management Professor Roger Martin has noted,2 many corporate strategies
avoid this:
The very essence of strategy is explicit, purposeful choice. Strategy is saying
explicitly, proactively: ‘We’re going to do these things and not those things for
these reasons’.
(Martin, 2015)3
The problem with a lot of strategies, he says, is that they are actually full of
non-choices. For example, simply saying that your strategy is to be customercentric
is not making an explicit choice about what to do, and what not
to do. The way to know when you have made a real strategic choice is
if you can easily define what the opposite of that choice is and it doesn’t
sound ridiculous. Non-choice strategies (and for that matter missions) do
09
132
Agile strategy and planning 133
lend themselves to confusion, misdirection and apathy, but do not lend
themselves to moving quickly.
If effective strategy is about making choices, then effective strategy for the
agile business is about signal versus noise, and framing the choices we make
through the lens of our three key contexts that we discussed in Part One:
●● Consumer: We need to be selective about which shifts in consumer
behaviour we prioritize, and which customer needs we choose to address
first. This means appreciating the difference between a fad (a temporary
spike in focus) and a trend (a more fundamental underlying shift). Fads
may be focused around technologies, trends around behaviours. Fads
may address customer needs in transient ways, trends speak to more
fundamental, long-term customer needs and behaviours. Prioritization,
and an adept sense of the relative significance of specific changes is key.
A company that is closely in touch with the customer, that is outwardly
facing and willing to experiment with the new in order to learn, and
one that is networked and able to draw on insight from a wide range
of sources, is optimized to create the most effective strategy in today’s
world.
●● Competitor: We need to make choices about where we play in the market,
to lead rather than obsessively follow and benchmark, to make more
ambitious choices about who we regard as competition and be more
open to who we can learn from.
●● Company: We need to understand the potential and application of new
and existing technologies, and how they might be combined in new ways
to create exceptional value. We need to be adept at knowledge flow, and
drawing learning from rapid experimentation and iterative working in
order to inform the choices we make around strategic direction.
If, as Roger Martin says, developing strategy often becomes ‘an exercise in
agglomerating initiatives, assigning responsibilities without a coherent set of
choices that help bind them’4 (meaning that most strategic plans are more
accurately described as ‘budgets with prose’), then we need to be clear that
this is not fit for purpose for an uncertain, rapidly moving business environment.
Neither is poor communication of strategy, or poor connection with
tactics and execution, or conflating a varied set of goals or targets with a
coherent strategy. Richard Rumelt said: ‘Goals are not strategy. Goals are
wishes. Strategies are how one goes about achieving goals’, but he also
defines what makes a good strategy:
134 Focus
A strategy is a coherent set of analyses, arguments and actions that respond
to a significant challenge. A good strategy derives from consideration of many
plausible courses of action and selects, in a deliberate, reasoned way, one/some
of those courses of action to the exclusion of others.5
His ‘strategy kernel’ combines diagnosis, the creation of a guiding policy,
and a coherent set of actions or direction. The agile business combines adept
analysis with creative and astute synthesis to be good at all three.
Emergent and deliberate strategy
In order to achieve true agility we need an organizational strategy that
retains the right combination of that which is fixed and ‘deliberate’, and that
which is more flexible, or emergent. Harvard Business School professor and
author Clay Christensen describes how strategy is ‘not a discrete analytical
event’ or something decided using best-known numbers at the time in a
meeting of senior managers. Instead, it is a ‘continuous, diverse, and unruly
process’ that constantly evolves.6 So the art of managing this is not to dismiss
anything that deviates from the original plan but to continually identify
better options and then manage resources flexibly to nourish them. Rigid
planning processes (particularly in large organizations, where challenging an
original fixed plan can often be a political, morale-killing exercise) mitigate
the flexibility needed to respond to rapidly changing contexts.
The example Christensen uses to illustrate the advantages of flexibility is
the way in which Honda broke into North America. The company’s strategy
was based entirely around big motorbikes (since that is what US consumers
seemed to favour), bringing them into competition with manufacturers like
Harley. Some Honda employees started to use a few of the much smaller
Supercub models to do a bit of weekend dirt biking in the hills around LA,
a Sears buyer sees the interest this generates, decides to stock them in the
outdoor equipment department, and a new opportunity for Honda, an
innovative distribution strategy, and a whole new genre of biking, is born.
Honda refocused their strategy on the Supercub which went on to become
the best selling two-wheeler on the planet, in no small part due to their ability
to break into the North American market.
Business is increasingly populated with examples of companies that have
‘pivoted’ in this way, and the high uncertainty and ambiguity that characterizes
our modern business environment lends a heightened importance
to this kind of fluidity. Image hosting and sharing service Flickr emerged
from tools that were created for a web-based multiplayer online game
Agile strategy and planning 135
called ‘game neverending’. Ludicorp, the game’s creators, then shelved the
game and pivoted to concentrate on growing Flickr. Pinterest began life as
a mobile shopping app called Tote that was arguably ahead of its time but
provided the foundations for the service we know today. Twitter grew as
a side project out of a podcast company called Odeo. Android, the largest
operating system in the world, began with the intention of creating an operating
ecosystem for digital cameras.
It is not just technology businesses that need to pivot. Professor Amar
Bhidé (in The Origin and Evolution of New Business)7 has shown that
93 per cent of all companies that ultimately become successful had to abandon
their original strategy. Companies that survive are able retain a high
and consistent level of strategic adaptation and improvisation, even if they
occasionally trip up along the way.
The balance between vision and iteration
Jeff Bezos once said:
We are stubborn on vision. We are flexible on details… If you’re not stubborn,
you’ll give up on experiments too soon. And if you’re not flexible, you’ll pound
your head against the wall and you won’t see a different solution to a problem
you’re trying to solve.8
Stubborn on vision. Flexible on details. These words capture the essence of
agile strategy. The balance between a strong, directional vision that steers,
guides and enables, and adaptive, iterative planning that flexes, adjusts and
modifies in response to changing contexts and new information.
Iteration without direction is chaotic. The vision should be challenging,
clear and compelling, but it needs to give direction to strategic choices and
decision-making throughout the business. Change does not come from the
CEO standing in front of the company with a PowerPoint presentation.
It comes from constant reinforcement through frequent repetition of the
vision and continuous communication of goals and progress. It comes
from the behaviours and decisions exhibited by senior leaders and those
around us. It comes from what we choose to recognize and reward, and how
we structure our learning. Every meeting, every update, every communication
is a chance to underline, fortify and energize around that vision.
Yet rigidly pursuing a plan with no room for frequent adaptation leads
to declining performance, missed opportunities and limited learning. Real
change also comes from the continuous iteration that drives progress towards
136 Focus
that vision. It comes from the flexibility that allows for enough autonomy
and plasticity to adapt planning to continuously learn and improve. Every
sprint, every retrospective, every actionable learning is a chance to advance
towards bringing that vision to life.
In Part Two, we discussed the analogy of how the high operational tempo
of Blitzkrieg was enabled through a command methodology that empowered
frontline commanders to make quick decisions in the face of rapidly shifting
contexts. The underlying goal, intent or focus of effort (the ‘Schwerpunkt’)
enabled clarity of objective and direction, and combined with a well-understood
level of flexibility for frontline commanders (‘Fingerspitzengefuhl’ or ‘fingertip
feel’) to enable rapid responsiveness and progression. This is a governance
structure built for speed and manoeuvrability.
Using a more modern military analogy, the US Army frame this balance in
the terms of a ‘Commander’s intent’ and the ‘concept of operations’. The former:
… succinctly describes what constitutes success for the operation. It includes the
operation’s purpose, key tasks, and the conditions that define the end state. It
links the mission, concept of operations, and tasks to subordinate units. A clear
commander’s intent facilitates a shared understanding and focuses on the overall
conditions that represent mission accomplishment.9
The Commander’s intent is the central objective or idea that pulls everything
together, the unifying element of the plan, the Commander’s expression of
what they want to make happen. The concept of the operation is designed
to direct the way in which subordinate units should cooperate to fulfill a
mission, and creates the sequence of actions that the force will actually use
to get to that objective. The Commander’s intent should therefore bridge
the gap between the mission and the concept of operations. This system has
represented a move away from an over-reliance on a rigid, and therefore
increasingly unsuitable methodical planning process which does not work
well in situations characterized by uncertainty. Again, it is a governance
structure designed for agility.
The agile organization therefore, has a good understanding of what is
fixed, and what is flexible, and the critical difference between a strategy and
a plan. This latter distinction is best expressed by Sir Lawrence Freedman:
Strategy is much more than a plan. A plan supposes a sequence of events that
allows one to move with confidence from one state of affairs to another. Strategy
is required when others might frustrate one’s plans because they have different
and possibly opposing interests and concerns… The inherent unpredictability
of human affairs, due to the chance events as well as the efforts of opponents
Agile strategy and planning 137
and the missteps of friends, provides strategy with its challenge and drama.
Strategy is often expected to start with a description of a desired end state, but
in practice there is rarely an orderly movement to goals set in advance. Instead,
the process evolves through a series of states, each one not quite what was
anticipated or hoped for, requiring a reappraisal and modification of the original
strategy, including ultimate objectives. The picture of strategy… is one that is
fluid and flexible, governed by the starting point and not the end point.10
So a strategy should be fluid, and open to creating many potential routes to
success (‘You don’t make strategy so that there’s one path to victory; you
make it so that as many paths as possible lead to something which isn’t loss,’
said Nick Harkaway in his novel The Gone-Away World).11 So the pace of
change at which each element evolves and adapts is key:
●● Mission and purpose: are fixed and do not change.
●● Vision: is compelling, and largely fixed.
●● Strategy: characterized by choices, changes and evolves to take account
of shifting contexts and new information, but does so more infrequently
or slowly.
●● Plans or tactics: are highly fluid, iterative and adaptive to feedback, learning
and new information.
Agility and adaptiveness increases the closer we get to execution, but the
strategy and governance that frames planning, tactics and delivery is flexible
enough to allow responsiveness throughout the organization. Leaders need
to set the expectation, establish the governance that acknowledges necessary
boundaries but removes barriers to progress, and empower teams with
required tools and resources. And then GET OUT OF THE WAY.
The customer-centric organization
Above all else, align with customers. Win when they win. Win only when
they win.
Jeff Bezos
In the agile business, the customer is the guiding beacon for the organizational
mission, vision and strategy, but also the operational priorities, tactics
and execution. Every company believes that they place the customer at the
heart of their business, yet so often the orientation and prioritization is
derived from what is easier and more efficient for the company, rather than
138 Focus
better and more effective for the customer. Businesses are frequently organized
in ways that make little sense for the customer (ever had a customer
service representative need to transfer you to another department because
they cannot action your query?). In resourcing prioritization, too much
emphasis is placed on business efficiency over customer satisfaction. Too
much customer-facing resource is focused on dealing with a failure of the
organization to do something or do it well (failure demand), rather than
helping to create more value (value demand). Poor application of automation,
use of scripts or inflexible rules and systems make for bad customer
service (many businesses still bury contact details on their website or even
worse, charge their customers to talk to them).12 Too many customer experiences
are not joined up, resulting in duplication of effort for the customer
and missed opportunity for the company.
We have already discussed how digital-native processes such as agile and
lean are naturally customer-centric, involving the customer along the development
process. Yet real customer-centricity stretches into every aspect of
the business, from process and strategy to culture, measures and even structure
(we will discuss more about customer-centric structures in Part Four).
Earlier we showed how Amazon takes the long view on innovation. But
they are also an exceptional exemplar for what true customer-centricity
really means (remember that the Amazon mission is: ‘We seek to be Earth’s
most customer-centric company for four primary customer sets: consumers,
sellers, enterprises, and content creators’). This is brought to life throughout
the operating model, measures and culture. As Jeff Bezos puts it:
We’re not competitor obsessed, we’re customer obsessed. We start with what the
customer needs and we work backwards.
Early in Amazon’s life, Jeff Bezos would famously bring an empty chair,
which represented the customer (or the most important person in the room)
into meetings. Each year thousands of Amazon managers (including the
founder) spend time in the call-centres to help ensure a culture of not just
listening to, but understanding, customers. Team objectives and metrics are
aligned to customer experience, and data-driven decision-making used to
continuously improve against those measures. Performance at Amazon is
tracked via 500 measurable goals, with almost 80 per cent of them relating
to customer objectives.13 Its highly tuned algorithms create an unparalleled
degree of content personalization across a customer base of hundreds
of millions of users. Customer experience is taken so seriously that even
the tiniest delays in web page loading time become a significant focus to
Agile strategy and planning 139
improve (they believe that a 0.1 second delay in page rendering can result
in a 1 per cent drop in customer activity). The Amazon obsession with efficiency
is driven by the desire to deliver better prices for customers, Bezos
waging war on ‘muda’ (the Japanese word for waste). Everything Amazon
do as a business is oriented towards the customer. The point is that saying
you are something doesn’t make it so. And customers can see that.
Customer-centricity can be a central driving force for digital transformation.
The UK Government Digital Service (GDS) are a small team of
people sitting at the centre of multiple government departments but who
have brought an unprecedented level of agility to what would typically be
a distinctly un-agile environment. From the beginning their approach has
been characterized by transparency, user-centricity, and solid service design
practice, as exhibited by their 10 design principles14 which read like a manifesto
for not just exceptional digital design, but a truly digital-native way of
working. To summarize:
1 Start with needs – user needs, of course, not government needs.
2 Do less – only do what you can do and concentrate on the ‘irreducible
core’. Make what works shareable and reusable to minimize duplication
of effort. Build platforms that others can build on, develop APIs, link to
the work of others.
3 Design with data – use data to demonstrate real behaviour, to learn,
to reduce assumption, to drive decision-making. Continuous iteration
using data to prototype, test and improve services. Analytics should be
embedded, always on and easy to understand.
4 Do the hard work to make it simple – work hard to make complex
systems easy for people to use, challenge toxic assumptions.
5 Iterate. Then iterate again – ‘start small and iterate wildly’. Test minimum
viable products and prototypes with real users. Make constant
improvements using customer feedback. Don’t be afraid to remove or
move on from what doesn’t work: ‘Iteration reduces risk. It makes big
failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons’.
6 This is for everyone – services should be accessible, inclusive, legible.
7 Understand context – design for people, not screens. Consider the
context in which services might be used.
8 Build digital services, not websites – connect the digital world to the
real world, consider all aspects of a service, make no assumptions about
platform.
140 Focus
9 Be consistent, not uniform – consistency in language and design patterns,
but respect shifting circumstances.
10 Make things open: it makes things better – the sharing of knowledge,
code, ideas, failures brings unforeseen benefit.
The traditional approach to service design was government-centric: start
with the government policy, then consider the process needed to fulfil
the policy, and then the systems needed to support that. User need came
far down the list, but this method led to overly detailed input, ‘digital
versions’ of existing practices, poor customer journeys, lengthy and
complex procurement procedures and inflexible solutions based on traditional
thinking.
The new approach turned that on its head: user needs provided the foundation,
services are designed around those needs, the systems needed to
support those services then considered, and then a check that the service
is delivering to government policy. GDS do the research, they analyse
the data, they talk to and observe users to make sure that they make no
assumptions, and are focusing on real needs (combining claimed behaviour,
or traditional forms of research such as surveys, polls and focus groups,
with real behaviour, assessed through observation or analytics, leads to a
more three-dimensional understanding of customer need). This fundamental
shift in approach not only ensures that service design is grounded in a
solid empathy with, and understanding of, user need (thereby leading to
better services), but catalyses a much broader philosophical and organizational
shift towards orienting processes, culture and resourcing towards the
customer. Executive Director at GDS Stephen Foreshew-Cain describes this
transformation thus:
The upshot will be services that shape government, not the other way round.
Because we’re putting users first, and because we’re working in an agile way,
and because we’re making data easier to use, government itself will have to
change.
(Foreshew-Cain, 2016)15
This ‘organizing idea’, he says, is not about incrementally making existing
things a little better; it is about completely rethinking the way that they
work. Combining service design methodologies with small, multidisciplinary
teams working in short, iterative sprints can bring a new breadth and
depth of customer-centricity to an organization, which can in turn lead to
real transformation.
Agile strategy and planning 141
‘P’ is for Prioritization
One of the key challenges with any digital transformation programme is
the prioritization of limited resources. Good prioritization can make the
difference between a successful transformation and complete failure and
yet there are some immediate pitfalls that many fall into. Poor technology
literacy among the senior leadership of an organization, for example, can
easily lead to poor decision-making about technology or project development
prioritization. In the age of horizontal innovation and accelerated,
non-incremental change, in-sector competitive activity can be disproportionately
significant in determining organizational priorities and a time-suck
on company resources. While competitive positioning and strategies are
important, so much management time in organizations is wasted analysing
what the competition are doing. Google founder Larry Page has talked
about how he thinks of his job as getting people not to think about what
Google’s competition are doing because rather than think about the things
that already exist he would rather his staff focused on the things that have
not been thought of yet. It is, he says, hard to find examples of amazing
things that have only happened because of competition, and if the focus is
simply on crushing another company that does almost the same thing, that
does not make for the most compelling place to work:
That’s why most companies decay slowly over time. They tend to do
approximately what they did before, with a few minor changes. It’s natural
for people to want to work on things that they know aren’t going to fail. But
incremental improvement is guaranteed to be obsolete over time.
(Page, 2013)16
One of the key inputs to prioritization, of course, is customer need. When
the Government Digital Service began the huge task of redesigning the
UK government portal they faced a massive prioritization challenge that
covered 660 services involving 1.3 billion transactions over 16 departments.
The team looked not only at what users wanted from those services, but also
prioritized projects based on usage patterns. The data told them that there
was a real long-tail to service usage with 26 per cent of services (or 4 per
cent of the total services) accounting for 90 per cent of transactions,17 so they
took the top 25 and made those the initial ones to focus on. This ensured
that they could have the biggest impact in the shortest possible time. Russell
Davies, who was Director of Strategy at the Government Digital Service
during the key period of early transformation, describes how you need to
142 Focus
start with a firework (an impactful win that can get people excited), followed
by some quick fixes (‘you need to make some stuff work surprisingly well,
surprisingly quickly and cheaply’), then move rapidly out of innovation
and fireworks into fixing the basics (‘transforming the basic reality of the
organization’), and focus on fundamentals such as digital infrastructure
(hiring, procurement, contracts, management), analytics and measurement
(including tracking key indicators), organizational blockers, governance and
reporting (‘an essential element of transformation is likely to be dissolving
the existing corporate silos – that can’t be done from within one of them’),
and of course, culture.
Stories from the frontline
Russell Davies: Prioritization in digital transformation
If you’re really doing digital transformation, you have to do everything first.
Everything’s connected. So you have to do everything.
Some things will happen first, but you have to start as much as you can
as soon as you can.
So, for instance, the plan to transform government publishing with GOV.
UK was part of a larger plan to transform government services as a whole.
That was prioritized since it was thought to be relatively quick, cheap and
easy to do. It would be very visible and would reach a lot of people.
Within the GOV.UK project itself there were then many other
prioritization decisions that were informed by a mixture of easiness and
impact. And those changed over time.
What you prioritize for the alpha – when you’re learning what to do and
trying to persuade people to let you do it – is different to when you have
full control and you’re grinding through the programme. For the alpha,
things that Ministers would immediately care about were prioritized. Once
their backing was secured, then came the stuff that would really matter.
On the whole we optimized for momentum – it was known that eventually
the machine would wake up and try to slow things down, so we tried to
change as much as we could as quickly as possible, so it would be harder
to unpick.
And then, inside the project itself there were a ton of decisions: What
services do we start with? Which departments should go first? It’s fractal –
priorities within priorities. Eventually you solve that by trusting the team
Agile strategy and planning 143
Prioritization via impact and effort is not new, but becomes particularly
important when the requirement is to demonstrate early value in a digital
transformation programme. Put simply, showing big impact in a short
space of time buys you more time, particularly if you can show the tangible
benefit not just to the business but also from the perspective of the customer
(nobody can argue with customer data). As well as impact and effort, a third
dimension to prioritization is, of course, time. As Dwight D Eisenhower
famously said:
What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important.
The Eisenhower matrix (Figure 9.1) is a simple but powerful way of balancing
these two criteria to define what we should pay attention to first.
It is, of course, important that we ensure we are not constantly ignoring
or scheduling for later development priorities that might not be urgent now,
but are fundamentally important for long-term capability or advancement.
doing it. You describe some outcomes, emphasize some things over others
(MOMENTUM!) and let them work out their own delivery priorities. Setting
specific priorities at every level is counter-productive, it becomes a version
of waterfall or (dread phrase) a Target Operating Model.
And, of course, zooming out again, if you’re doing proper transformation
you can’t set these priorities in isolation. In order to transform publishing
you need digital specialists, which means you need to hire different
people, which means you need to change the HR practices, which means
you need to change hiring guidelines and recruit different HR people and
rewrite all the ads and find a way round the salary restrictions. And you
have to give people the right tools which means you have to persuade IT
to allow people internet access and to change accounting practices so
people can use a government purchasing card to sign up to Heroku ($99,
30 seconds) rather than use the single source hosting contract ($ millions,
months). That’s all at the apparently trivial level, but it actually makes a
huge difference. And at a more apparently ‘transformational’ level you
probably have to fire, disempower, or sidestep the existing IT organization
and their suppliers. Which may well mean changing the composition of the
board. You’ll probably have to change the way procurement works and reeducate
them about what a good IT contract looks like. You might need to
extract all kinds of digital stuff from the marketing and sales organization.
It goes on and on.
144 Focus
Ring fencing resource and allocating to short- and long-term needs helps
mitigate this, and simple scorecard approaches (including, for example,
an assessment of customer impact, risk, cost, time and profit contribution)
can be highly effective in prioritizing development. Any broader innovation
or transformation programme can be significantly undermined by
poor, nonsensical service design and delivery and so fixing basic but poorly
designed customer or product experiences and unnecessary barriers to seamless
customer journeys can often be a powerful driver for change. Remember,
innovation is no substitute for basic competence.
Clarity of roadmap ownership and governance, robust prioritization
methodologies and capacity planning against set criteria are essential to
prevent capacity overload and development precedence being given to inappropriate
internal priorities (like from those who shout loudest) rather than
those that make sense for the customer.
But when is it not right to listen to our customers? It is, of course, a myth
that Apple do not do research, but Steve Jobs famously described the limitations
of customer feedback when designing the new:
It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t
know what they want until you show it to them.
Henri Seydoux, Founder and CEO of technology and drone business Parrot
describes how there are times when they have no consideration of the user,
and other times when they are extremely sensitive to user need:
Urgent
Importance
Do it now
Delegate

Agile strategy and planning 145
When your idea is totally new, you cannot ask the user… if you ask people to
dream with you, they not will understand with you, or the dream will not be
serious.18
Seydoux relates the story of how an idea for a connected picture frame
rapidly became overcomplicated by focus groups who relayed all kinds of
additional features that they wanted to the point where it became untenable.
Yet for a developing or existing market, continuous customer feedback is
key. As Clay Christensen said:
Working harder, being smarter, investing more aggressively, and listening more
astutely to customers are all solutions to the problems posed by new sustaining
technologies. But these paradigms of sound management are useless – even
counterproductive, in many instances – when dealing with disruptive technology.19
The secret is to design with vision and optimize with feedback.
Strategy as an ever-changing algorithm
Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.
Mike Tyson
We have discussed how the agile business is stubborn on vision but flexible
on details, and how strategy is about making choices, continually defining
better options, evolving in response to shifting contexts but changing more
slowly than the highly fluid and adaptive planning process. Noah Brier, the
founder of marketing software business Percolate, describes strategy as an
ever-changing algorithm and it is a useful analogy. If algorithms create a
set of rules that enable problems to be solved, then strategy ‘is really about
building algorithms that help drive optimal outcomes in decisions’.20
If we think about strategy as an ever-evolving algorithm, then the rules or
guidelines that we set should help us to navigate the terrain that we need to
cross. Just as algorithms constantly change to take account of new inputs,
so a strategy should be emergent, constantly taking account of new contexts
and what data and insight is telling us in order to find the path to the optimal
solution. Google updates the search algorithm hundreds of times a year but
periodically undergoes a major overhaul that impacts how it works in more
fundamental ways, in the same way that strategies continuously morph but
periodically need a significant correction to keep us on track when we are in
danger of getting thrown off-course.
146 Focus
While rigid, top-down strategy is the more traditional domain, the
requirement in the agile business is both to set the strategy in such a way
that it can evolve utilizing a continuous stream of insight, data and feedback
from customer facing teams, and in an environment of increasingly transient
competitive advantage to be ready to disengage and refocus, even when the
business is still viable. As Rita Gunther McGrath describes it:
One of the most significant differences between the assumption of sustainable
competitive advantage and more dynamic strategy is that disengagement – the
process of moving out of an exhausted opportunity – is as core to the business
as innovation, growth, and exploitation are.21
So just as we should work to increase the pace of change and responsiveness
in the way in which we work, we need to take more account of the
tempo of change in our strategy and planning process and find ways to
embed this practice and thinking. A useful framework for this has been
created by ex-Global Head of Brand Design at Facebook and now VP of
Product at Intercom Paul Adams, who describes an effective way of thinking
about your product roadmap by delineating over three timelines: the next
six years, next six months, and next six weeks. Paul applies the framework
in the context of a product roadmap but it is just as applicable to a more
adaptive approach to strategy:
●● The next six years: this is your view on the shape of the world six years
out, taking account of how key trends and your own actions will have
changed it. This is your strategy of trajectory.
●● The next six months: your focus here is on your plans for building, creating
or executing things that will materially impact on progress towards
your long-term strategy. This is a rolling timeline that can evolve so that
at the end of the six months, says Paul, you may have built 50–75 per
cent of what you set out to do, but the remaining 25 per cent is made up
of new things that you had not thought of before.
●● The next six weeks: the immediate plan which is known well, and is
being worked on in detail right now, and changes iteratively as a rolling
timeline every week or two.
The timescales used in the ‘666 roadmap’ are less important than the threetimeline
concept (although aligning it with the ‘number of the beast’ no
doubt creates plenty of opportunity for amusement among product teams)
which allows for a directional view on the future, a mid-term adaptive strategy,
and a highly iterative short-term plan.
Agile strategy and planning 147
Discovery-driven planning
Processes such as agile and lean are designed to remove as many assumptions
from development as possible. With an exponential increase in the quantity
of available data, applying that data in the service of challenging assumptions
(particularly the hidden, or ‘toxic’, assumptions that go unquestioned)
is an essential requirement in helping the agile business get to the outcomes
it desires. If, alongside this, we are tracking back from our vision of the
future in order to reimagine our present priorities (rather than extrapolating
from a past which may be defined by out-of-date assumptions) then we
have a more solid basis for crafting our agile strategy. But there are times,
such as when we are entering new or poorly defined areas, when the ratio
of assumptions we are forced to incorporate relative to the knowledge we
already possess is likely to be unusually high. Emergent, iterative strategy
and planning helps to mitigate risk, but it is still critical to identify as many
avoidable, or hidden, assumptions as possible.
Rita Gunther McGrath’s discovery-driven planning22 is a useful concept
that forces you to identify a desired outcome, and then ask what needs to be
true in order for that outcome to happen. Conventional planning is based on
a premise that future results can be accurately extrapolated from the predictable
platform of past results and so may be useful in a stable, incremental or
known scenario. Discovery-driven planning focuses on establishing the key
truths that are needed for an outcome to be achieved and so is much more
useful for those ventures that are new, more unknown, or characterized by
a greater degree of uncertainty.
McGrath uses a great case study to illustrate the folly of using conventional
planning techniques for a new venture – the launch of Euro Disney
Resort (what is now Disneyland Paris). The launch in 1992 was something
of a disaster, with numbers of visitor-days falling far short of expectations.
Two years after launch it had accumulated losses of more than US$1 billion
and only achieved its target of 11 million admissions after a drastic drop in
ticket prices.
In the planning process Disney had used assumptions based on their
extensive knowledge derived from their experience running parks in other
parts of the world (United States and Japan). There were some pretty big
assumptions around the admissions price that punters would be prepared to
pay, how European customers would want to eat, and the type of merchandise
they would buy. But the really punishing assumption was that (based
on their experience in other markets) they had assumed that people would
stay an average of four days in the park’s hotels. And yet the average stay in
148 Focus
the early days was only two days. Euro Disney opened with only 15 rides,
compared with 45 at Walt Disney World. People could do all the rides in a
single day and so had little reason to stay longer.
In order to avoid such outcomes, McGrath defines a number of disciplines
including: specifying a clear frame for the project (including quantifiable
goals); the importance of basing plans in market and competitive reality; to
translate strategy into specific, implementable actions (working backwards
from what you have to deliver); to document, test and revisit assumptions;
and finally planning to learn at key milestones.
In discovery driven plans, the whole plan is organized around converting the
maximum number of assumptions to knowledge at minimum cost.
As the novelist E L Doctorow once said:
Writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your
headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.
With discovery-driven planning we have enough knowledge to plan in detail
to the next major milestone but not beyond it, so the key is to test assumptions
as you go at key milestones. Much like agile and lean, this approach is
motivating, giving people freedom to test and learn rather than shouldering
them with an obligation to justify divergence from a flawed original plan.
The key question to always ask: What needs to be true in order for this
outcome to be achieved? This form of emergent strategy has never been
more appropriate than it is today.

Linking strategy
to execution
The five questions
To understand a company’s strategy, look at what they actually do rather than
what they say they will do.
Andy Grove
In the agile business, the link between strategy and execution is critical to
enabling the organization to move fast, yet misalignment, or worse, confusion
about what the corporate strategy is and how it relates to team strategy
and execution often prevails in many companies. Roger Martin has described
how strategy is the answer to five key questions that cascade logically:
1 What are our broad aspirations and the concrete goals against which we
can track progress?
2 Across the potential field available to us, where will we choose to play
and not play?
3 How will we choose to win against the competitors in this chosen place?
4 What capabilities do we require to win?
5 What management systems are needed to build, operate and maintain
these key capabilities?1
The key to applying these five questions successfully, he says, is to understand
that since the questions are interlinked and cascading, so the answers should
be consistent, linked and reinforcing. The challenge comes in appreciating
that this interlinking means that an iterative approach is often required. It
may be difficult to start at the top with a compelling vision, for example,
without some idea of the answers to the next two questions. So this requires
iterating back and forth between the five questions, using the answers we
are getting in one area to inform the answers in the others. This kind of
iteration actually makes strategy easier:
10
151
152 Focus
It will save you from endless visioning exercises, misdirected SWOT analyses,
and lots of heroically uninformed big thinking. Crafting your strategy in
relatively small and concrete chunks and honing the answers to the five
questions through iteration will get you a better strategy, with much less pain
and wasted time.2
Rather than leadership being like the brain (making key choices, controlling
everything) and the rest of the organization being like the body (delivering
what the brain tells it to), a more useful conception of the corporation sees
cascades of the five questions (and answers) operating at the corporate, strategic
group and individual level, all linked together to ensure strategy is tied
closely to execution (Figure 10.1).

Strategy and tactic trees
Another way of framing this concept is the idea of strategy and tactic trees.
Many businesses set a company-wide strategy and then regard everything
else as a tactic that contributes toward that strategy. Not so. Dr Eli Goldratt
(in 2002)3 observed that strategy itself has a hierarchical structure, and that
Linking strategy to execution 153
there might be several layers of strategy that are each connected by necessary
conditions. In this way, objectives at a lower level are prerequisites for
objectives at a higher level – the former more specific or detailed than the
latter (Figure 10.2).
Goldratt defined strategy as the answer to the question ‘What for?’ (in
other words the overarching direction needed to get to an objective), and
tactics as the answer to the question ‘How to?’ (the steps in the process
needed to pursue the strategy). In defining his strategy and tactics trees,
he argued that if strategy was hierarchical, every strategy should have an
associated tactic and the two should always exist in pairs at every level
of the organization. Thus, a strategy can be brought to life and related to
specific actions at every level. As an addendum to this concept, we should
also consider the role of measures, aligned to tactics and strategies at every
level of the organization, in order to ensure that our metrics too are linked,
coordinated, and that strategy truly aligns with execution.
OKRs: bringing the team with you
OKRs, or Objectives and Key Results, is a methodology for connecting
company, team and individual goals and measurable results that was originally
introduced at Intel in the 1970s. John Doerr, an Intel executive and

Google board member introduced the framework to Google early in the
company’s journey as a way of helping them align objectives and direction
across the business as they scaled rapidly. They are still in use at Google
today, and have since expanded out to other technology sector businesses
(including LinkedIn, Oracle, Twitter) and beyond.
The system involves setting quarterly measurable, definitive objectives at
a company, team and individual level, and then supporting those objectives
with quantifiable key results, against which performance is measured. OKRs
are generally transparent (at Google for example, everyone’s OKRs from
Larry Page the CEO down are available to see on the internal directory)
but provide a clear directional focus and expectations, ensure alignment at
every level, and a high level of awareness of what others priorities are. This
brings greater empathy and understanding for individual or team priorities,
and giving focus to how an individual might make their own priorities align
with someone else’s in order to get stuff done.
Between three and five ambitious, achievable and time-bound objectives are
set at each level. Each objective is supported by three or four measurable results
that are clearly quantifiable, stretching while attainable, and can provide the
basis for grading performance. The grading against each result can be scored 0
to 100, or 0 to 1.0 according to the level of achievement. These result indicators
can be updated regularly throughout the quarter, perhaps weekly, but are
designed to be stretching. When objectives are scored, we might consider them
as not ambitious enough if 100 per cent of results have been achieved, but
instead if we have achieved a score around 70 per cent, we can consider this
to be successful. OKRs may be operational or more aspirational (fixed against
bigger, longer-term goals) but can be regularly reviewed to ensure that they
remain ambitious, and that they are always aligned to evolving strategic needs.
If your mission and vision provide the long view, this might then be
expressed in a limited number of objectives and key results at an organizational
level, which in turn can then be delineated in team and individual
OKRs (Figure 10.3).

Linking strategy to execution 155
The key benefit to the OKR system is that it clearly aligns strategy with
execution and measurement at every level of the organization, ensures
disciplined thinking around major goals, demonstrates to everyone very
clearly what is important to the organization, enables transparency around
individual and team priorities, and ensures regular review of objectives
and motivates and tracks progress towards them. In this way, OKRs can
play a key role in transformation, and towards becoming a more agile
business.
Stories from the frontline
Duncan Hammond, Delivery Director at Guardian News & Media: Using
OKRs to drive change
In 2015 the Guardian appointed a new Editor in Chief, Katharine Viner,
and a new CEO, David Pemsel. This was the biggest leadership change in
many years and it gave the Guardian a great opportunity to take stock and
review its strategic priorities.
The Guardian will be 200 years old in 2021. So Katharine and David
posed a simple question; what will the Guardian be at the age of 200? This
led to a six-month strategic review, named Project 2021, which culminated
in a new three-year strategic plan designed to change the organization
and set us on a sustainable path to the future. We called our three-year
plan The Relationship Strategy.
The Project 2021 process revealed some difficult realities about the
challenges facing the Guardian, we called them The Unvarnished Truths.
These truths were major blockers to achieving sustainability.
One of the unvarnished truths stated our organization was too complex
and insufficiently agile. With complexity came a lack of clarity on what our
strategic priorities were; how we allocate our resources for the greatest
impact; how we express our intent and measure success, or failure; and
how we ensure the right people are collaborating at the right time, focused
on the right things.
In the year prior to unveiling The Relationship Strategy we had been
experimenting in small pockets of the organization with the Objectives
and Key Results framework, also known as OKRs. OKRs were invented by
Intel in the late 1970s and famously adopted by Google in 2001. It’s a simple
framework which introduces a consistent approach to setting aspirational
goals and measurable results to judge success (or failure). We had some

Sprint working as a driver of change
Working in iterative time-blocks, or sprints is, of course, central to agile
and lean processes, each sprint forming a repeatable cycle of work that is
confined to that unit of time and characterized by one iteration of the process.
Working in sprints has a number of not insignificant benefits including:
●● Clear focus on a set of expected outcomes to be delivered by the end of
the sprint – each sprint commits to a set of deliverables, with review and
reprioritization at regular intervals.
successes with OKRs in these small experiments and had aspirations to
adopt them more widely as part of our new strategy.
The first step we took was to set five organization-wide objectives
(OKRs), to focus us for the first year of the new strategy. These directly
cascaded from the vision the Editor and CEO had crafted for the Guardian.
If we could deliver these five objectives, we would be on a trajectory to
deliver the Relationship Strategy successfully over the following years.
Next, we introduced the concept of huddles. Huddles are small, crossfunctional
teams, focused on delivering an OKR of their own. They’re
normally expected to deliver over three months. They have the freedom to
approach the challenge as they see fit, and take a test-and-learn approach
to delivering the best possible solution.
A huddle’s OKR directly cascades from one of the organization-wide
objectives. This ensures we’re focusing on the ideas that have the biggest
impact on the strategy. It’s clear how the huddle’s work fits into the bigger
picture. And the huddle members should be able to see how their day-today
tests are impacting on the overall vision of the Guardian.
Having a common approach to setting objectives for huddles, and a
shared language, has helped democratize the quarterly process. It has
forced new behaviours and encourages teams to be more strategic in
their thinking, ensuring the work they prioritize has the most impact on
our strategy. And it has enabled the organization, and our leaders, to be
clearer in their approach to prioritization and resource allocation.
The OKR framework has improved our focus and working in huddles has
increased the diversity of ideas and approaches to delivering an objective.
These two things alone won’t solve all the challenges we face, but they
have gone a long way to improving the way we deliver our strategic
priorities at the Guardian.
Linking strategy to execution 157
●● Embedded feedback loops and learning – testing with real customers
(wherever possible) and regular retrospectives empower learning and
data-driven decision-making.
●● Multi-disciplinary working – most teams working on sprints will be
small and multi-disciplinary, comprised of the key functions needed to
enable the outputs, which maintains continuous progress, ensures better
communication and contributes to team spirit.
●● Greater velocity – clarity of direction towards tangible, achievable
outcomes, blocks of time for ‘doing’ and a focus on removing barriers to
progress all ensure a heightened level of velocity. Constant iteration and
focus on continuous improvement enhances pace and performance.
●● Improved transparency – the defined tasks, level of difficulty, and progress
against specific tasks are typically made visible to the whole team (and
others), the practice of daily stand-up meetings enables blockers to be
addressed at the earliest opportunity.
●● Greater accuracy – working in cycles helps challenge and remove assumptions
and improves forecasting accuracy.
●● Energizing and motivated working – participants can see both working
outputs, and clear progress against longer-term objectives which is both
galvanizing and empowering.
Sprints can operate to different timescales and it is important to define for
your own context the blocks of time that will be short enough to enable
rapid progress and long enough to ensure useful working outputs at the end
of each one. In agile methodologies such as Scrum for example, sprints may
be two weeks long, but some development sprints may be as short as one
week. The Google Ventures Design Sprint,4 for example, is a five-day iterative
sprint process:
1 Day one – Understand: agree the goal and target, map the challenge,
draw in insight, analytics and research to inform.
2 Day two – Diverge: draw in inspiration, ideate, remix ideas, envisage
solutions.
3 Day three – Decide: critique solutions, converge on the best idea, storyboard
that idea.
4 Day four – Prototype: turn the storyboard into something you can test,
create the simplest possible prototype.
5 Day five – Validate: with real users wherever possible, learn what does
and doesn’t work.
158 Focus
Sprint working is central to the agile business and has far wider application
than simply technology and innovation teams. It is a naturally empowering,
energizing, motivating way of working that can drive organizational
momentum, invigorate innovation, and act as a catalyst for new mindsets
and behaviours that can support greater agility and ‘transformation through
doing’. Don’t keep that confined to the technology team.
Data-driven decision-making
Typically information is defined in terms of data, knowledge in terms of
information, and wisdom in terms of knowledge.
(Jennifer Rowley)5
Data-driven decision-making is essential in the agile business. Data is
central to the flow of knowledge into and within a business, to governance
processes, performance optimization and customer experience delivery. The
fallacy of ‘big data’ (extremely large data sets that require specific techniques
to analyse computationally in order to reveal associations, relationships
and patterns) is that most organizations do not have the volume or variety
of data or the velocity of data processing (the so-called ‘3Vs’)6 required to
qualify to join the ‘big data’ club. Nonetheless, companies are awash with
data, typically with small proportions of it being analysed and applied in
the service of business optimization. An oft-quoted study by IDC from 2012
found that less than 1 per cent of the world’s data was being analysed.7
In order to structure an approach to deriving value from data, we need to
understand the hierarchy of value at the simplest level. The Data, Information,
Knowledge, Wisdom (DIKW) model is a straightforward way to position
this. Raw data, observations, measurements at the bottom of the pyramid
have little value until you are able to put some structure around the data, and
turn it into information. Information is capable of answering simple who,
what, where, when questions. Applying meaning, understanding relationships
and connections turns it into knowledge. Knowledge answers the ‘how’
question but still has limited value. Wisdom, at the top of the pyramid is
attained through the application or use of knowledge and answers the ‘why’.
The opportunity apparent in the smart application of knowledge through
data is manifold and yet few companies invest time and resource in creating
an integrated data strategy. Key areas within a data strategy that require
focus include:
●● Collection of data – What data do we need to drive business outcomes?
What questions do we ask? What sources? What level of detail?
Linking strategy to execution 159
●● Storage, management and access – What technologies, processes, governance,
privacy rules, location, security?
●● Architecture, integration and flow of data – structure, network, breaking
down data silos.
●● Insight, analysis and application – What information and knowledge is
required by whom? What needs to be real-time? How do we align with
organizational objectives? What skills, resources, roles, responsibilities?
How can we ensure insight is actionable? What is the role for algorithms,
automation and dashboards?
As business moves from simple analytics to data science, so it is shaping
entirely new requirements not just for technology, but also for capabilities,
roles and business processes. Agile businesses are establishing robust
infrastructure and resourcing alongside intuitive interfaces and dashboards
that enable analytics (often real-time) to become central to the governance,
performance and operations of the business. But in the words of the UK
Government Digital Service, do the hard work to keep it simple. Success
through data depends on widespread process and practice adoption,
comprehensive strategy and application, but also on supportive behaviours.
It needs to be embedded in the culture.
Technology as a barrier to change
New technology is usually viewed as both a driver and an enabler of change.
But sometimes the reverse is true. Large businesses often feel comfortable
making big decisions about big spends on big solutions (this is akin to the
‘Bigger-Higher-Faster-Farther’ philosophy prevalent among the US Air Force
hierarchy that John Boyd fought so hard against). To draw a metaphor from
Star Wars, we might call this the ‘Death Star’ IT approach. When technology
is seen in companies as the solution to a business need, the answer can often
look like a large, expensive, proprietary software system.
Since it is expensive, the system is complex enough to require a lengthy
training course to understand how to use it and is accompanied by a thick
user manual that few people ever read. Since it is complex, when people
(being people) make errors it requires valuable management time to unpick
them. Since it is inflexible to changing requirements, it attempts to mould
people to its needs, rather than moulding itself to the needs of the people
that use it. Since it is not open-source (because it comes from a world where
value has traditionally been generated through protected proprietary assets),
160 Focus
it struggles to update at the pace required to keep up with shifting requirements
and contexts. Since it is designed to fulfil a specific function in a
specific way, the cost of adaptation is high, and when adaptation is required
(as it inevitably will be) new functions get added in layers so that it becomes
more unwieldy over time, not less.
Adding more users to the system simply makes it more expensive, not
more powerful. Because of its high cost, it is retained by the business for an
extended period of time, and eventually required to fulfil functions that it
was never designed to do. So it does them badly. Perhaps it is one of several
such systems within the organization. Systems that likely don’t talk to each
other. At least not intuitively. So data and outputs are difficult to join up.
And more management time is spent dealing with anomalies. Sometimes
a big expensive system is the right way to go. But the consequences and
opportunity costs of the choices we make are often hidden. If you make it
expensive to change, you will likely not. And nothing endures but change.
Technology as an enabler of change
In 2013, the UK Government Cabinet Office engaged the Government
Digital Service in a process to develop a different way to deliver technology
to government departments and the civil service. At the start of the process,
GDS defined an aim to ‘deliver modern, flexible technology services that
are at least as good as those people use at home’,8 and ones that were less
expensive than those currently in place. They set out some guiding principles
that provide a blueprint for technology acquisition and transformation,
and speak of the fundamental need not for rigid, detailed, upfront planning
processes, but of flexibility. Rather than the ‘Death Star’ IT, we might think
of this as the ‘X-Wing fighter’ approach to technology. To paraphrase:
●● Start with user need – don’t start buying things until you understand
what users want.
●● Design with choice and flexibility in mind – offer solutions that benefit
individuals as well as teams.
●● Make the process transparent – ensure users and stakeholders understand
key approaches by being open about decisions and actions.
●● Architect loosely coupled services – allow for greater flexibility, less
dependency and duplication (‘a key success measure for the programme
is that we should never have to do it again’), services that can independently
be replaced or swapped in and out.
Linking strategy to execution 161
●● Favour short contracts – to enable flexibility in response to the rapid
change in technology capability.
●● Bring the best of consumer technology to the enterprise – devices and
cloud applications that intuitive and contemporary.
●● Make security as invisible as possible – security is important, but it
shouldn’t get in the way of user experience.
●● Build a long-term capability – don’t rely on a single outsource vendor,
establish necessary skills in-house to support (‘technology delivery
doesn’t end with the programme’).
Technology can be a powerful enabler of change, with significant opportunity
deriving from three complementary but overlapping elementals:
1 Analytics, tracking and measurement: It was sociologist William Bruce
Cameron who said ‘Not everything that can be counted counts. Not
everything that counts can be counted’9 (a quote often attributed incorrectly
to Einstein) which is why we should spend at least as much time
focusing on what to measure, as we do measuring it. Data should inform
but not dictate strategy, insights need to be actionable, we should focus on
measuring what really matters rather than vanity metrics (those that may
have large numbers but which are ultimately superficial or easily manipulated).
In physics, momentum is the product of the mass and velocity of
an object, and so when tracking momentum of change we should focus
on measuring not only the pace of progress but also the elements that add
weight to create momentum change (behaviour and attitude change).
2 Automation, communication and infrastructure: From dynamic pricing
systems to self-driving trucks to new communication tools, technology
can facilitate, network, notify, optimize, distribute, aggregate, filter.
From business process automation, to communication and notification
systems, customer service interaction, marketing automation and
lead management, workflow automation can bring powerful efficiency
benefits, augment human decision-making, and automatize uniform,
repetitive tasks. Yet we need to remember that not every business process
can be automated, and that human oversight, intervention and strategic
or creative input is never very far away from the most adept application
of machines.
3 Artificial intelligence and machine learning: Taking simple automation
to new levels, agile businesses will increasingly apply machine learning
to enable pattern recognition and continuous improvement in areas as
diverse as customer insight, forecasting, production, service optimization,
162 Focus
information flow and distribution, and demand anticipation. While
machine learning is already being applied to help solve simple problems,
or as a valuable part of more complex decision-making flows, the
adept use of ever-more sophisticated artificial intelligence capabilities will
create the competitive advantage of the future.
If a business is to be truly agile, no employee should be coming into the
workplace bemoaning the fact that the technology is worse there than it is at
home. Technology stacks should be malleable enough to bend easily to the
inevitable shifts in requirements. Interfaces should be intuitive and simple
to learn. Communication technologies should facilitate agile, fast conversation,
connection and distribution (think IM and chat services like Slack,
rather than entirely relying on e-mail). The guiding principles for technology
as a driver for change are flexibility, adaptability and scalability.
Agile budgeting
A last word (for this Part) on budgeting. We can establish highly flexible,
adaptive and iterative working practices but they will fail if not supported
by suitably flexible, adaptive and iterative budgeting.
As we discussed in Part Two, traditional accounting methods may
work well for established propositions but new ventures characterized
by increased uncertainty, iterative value, and test and learn should not be
shackled to short-term targets, over-burdensome reporting and inappropriate
measures. Like Eric Ries’s ‘innovation accounting’, we need instead to
focus on actionable, early stage metrics that can show value before revenue,
and demonstrate sufficient progress towards the ultimate goals of customer
satisfaction and profit. But more broadly financial resourcing needs to
support an orientation towards experimentation, and the fulfilment of not
only short-term objectives, but longer-term, breakthrough goals.
The politics of budgeting can act as a drag-brake on agility. Overly
hierarchical decision-making on financial controls slows progress. Overly
bureaucratic budget setting processes act as a time-suck for management.
Siloed control of financial resources reduces flexibility and manoeuvrability.
As Rita Gunther McGrath expounds, it is about investing in flexibility:
Firms built to thrive under transient-advantage conditions handle resources
differently from firms designed for exploitation. In an exploitation-oriented firm,
reliable performance, scale, and replication of processes from one place to another
make a lot of sense because you can operate more efficiently and gain the benefits
Linking strategy to execution 163
of scale. Resources, therefore, are directed to support these goals, and changing
these resource flows is painful and difficult. A transient-advantage-oriented firm,
on the other hand, allocates resources to promote what I call deftness – the ability
to reconfigure and change processes with a certain amount of ease, quickly.10
Financial resourcing that is oriented not only towards efficiency and optimization,
but towards finding the next star product, the next breakthrough,
the next curve. Financial resourcing that supports the mitigation of risk
through investment in multiple test-and-learn scenarios to explore new
opportunities, rather than the ‘Bigger-Higher-Faster-Farther’ school of
financing. Financial resourcing that is fast and flexible enough to support
the truly agile organization.
Key takeouts
In this Part we have focused on building a heightened momentum within
the organization through enhanced velocity allied to a reinvigorated focus,
brought to life in new ways of working. Key takeouts include:
1 Map out the organizational purpose, mission, vision and values. Make
them unique, compelling and easy-to-grasp. An ambitious, motivating
call-to-arms.
2 Create a positive sense of urgency to drive continuous change towards
that compelling vision. Communicate the vision repeatedly, bring it to
life at every opportunity, live it, breathe it, exhibit it in leadership actions
and behaviours.
3 Create the space to pursue that long-term vision, to solve the big problems,
to enable breakthrough innovation. Fight the suck of resources to
short-term targets and priorities.
4 Have a point of view on the future. Pay attention to what doesn’t change,
as well as what is changing. Work back from that vision of the future
to empower different thinking and shape near-term priorities towards
long-term goals.
5 Create clarity in strategy through making definitive choices shaped by
consumer, competitor and company contexts.
6 Be stubborn on vision, but flexible on detail. Combine emergent strategy
with highly fluid, iterative planning.
7 Orient strategies, processes, resourcing, operational priorities and
execution towards the customer. Don’t sacrifice customer experience
164 Focus
for efficiency gain. Use short, fast customer feedback loops inherent in
processes such as agile and lean to embed customer focus in development
and operational working. Put user need at the centre, start with
the customer and work backwards, but design with vision and optimize
with feedback. Use data in the design process to validate and drive
decision-making.
8 Be ruthless about prioritization. Know your competitors but don’t
follow them. Balance importance to the organization with impact to
the customer. Fix flawed customer experiences before investing in shiny
innovation.
9 Use a three-timeline strategy framework to align short-, medium- and
long-term strategy and planning. Work to remove as many assumptions
as possible. Ask what needs to be true in order to achieve a desired
outcome.
10 Link strategy to execution at every level of the organization using strategy
and tactic trees and OKRs.
11 Build organizational momentum by using sprint working as a driver for
change, to shift behaviours and mindsets as well as processes, and to
catalyse innovation, new ways of working and transformation.
12 Develop a robust data strategy to support transformation and
performance.
13 Take a user-centric approach to technology, guided by principles of flexibility,
adaptability and scalability.
14 Support change with fast, flexible budgeting that enables the space to
experiment and the adaptability to manoeuvre fast.

Part four
Flexibility
In this Part we consider the role of people, culture, structures, resourcing in
enabling and facilitating change.
Flexibility – adaptable, able to be easily modified to respond to altered
circumstances, to bend without breaking, workable, malleable, supple, ready
and able to change.
Defining flexibility
In 2014, author and social innovator Charles Leadbeater wrote a paper (The
London Recipe: How systems and empathy make the city)1 that attempted
to define the key facets or ingredients that combined to create a successful
city. Some of the best recipes, said Leadbeater, comprise two key ingredients
(like eggs and bacon or fish and chips) and so it is with cities that a combination
of two factors that determine success or failure – systems and empathy:
Systems oil cities. Without effective power, transport, health and education
systems, cities fall apart. But it’s empathy that makes cities human.2
We need systems to ‘bring together disparate interacting components
to achieve a common purpose’, to have processes and methods, to make
everything work easily and reliably at scale, and to gain efficiencies. Life
is chaotic without shared systems. And yet we also depend on the ‘dark
matter’ of empathy, our capacity for insight, affinity, rapport, to understand
and find common ground, to collaborate, cooperate and engage in sharing
and exchange.
The city, Leadbeater said, is at its absolute best when it combines both
of these things, where ‘lots of people use efficient systems to have a highly
convivial, charged, shared experience’ (Figure P4.1).
167
168 Flexibility
Success comes from this combination of both systems and empathy
(Leadbeater used the London Olympics in 2012 as an example of when
efficiency of large-scale systems combined with very human connections and
approaches to great effect). System-heavy entities may look impressive but
they can often feel dead. Empathy brings in the countless small and large
acts that make large systems human.
In his paper, Leadbeater talks about how a key challenge when building
systems is how to scale empathy. A city, like a large organization, is
a social system in that it comprises lots of people interacting in different
ways. Interactions between elements over time become systems when they
naturally evolve to develop a set of understood and recognized boundaries
that help define them. These emergent conditions help to guide and shape
the way in which the system operates and may then become more rigidly
defined rules. But as this scales the factors that once created the value in
relations and interactions can be challenged, undermined or corrupted so
that we lose connection, intimacy and empathy.
Organizations are systems but in the digital age, now more than ever,
they need empathy at scale to survive and thrive. To become a truly agile
organization, therefore, we need structured systems and efficiency but we
need to combine that with human-centred approaches, processes and experiences.
Trying to introduce agile into a non-agile culture will not work unless
we face the human-centred challenges that will inevitably arise. Trying to
create change without bringing people on the journey with you will lead to

failure. Attempting to become more responsive as an organization without
accepting the need to think differently about the fluidity of resourcing will
not work.
To become more agile we need the human-centred flexibility in culture,
resourcing and behaviours to create the environment in which change can
really happen. Put simply:
(velocity × focus) – flexibility = failure

Agile structures
and resourcing
The decisions we make around how we choose to build, structure and
apportion our capability have a fundamental impact on our ability to deliver
our strategy but also our capacity to be more agile. So what do we mean
by agility in resourcing? Traditional approaches are often characterized by
rigid functional or divisional silos, inflexible roles and job descriptions, a
focus on owned assets and exploiting existing positions, large downsizing
programmes, restrictive approaches to career mobility, demotivating performance
review systems, control over resources being seen as commensurate
with power and influence, and change disliked and avoided.
Our historical approaches emphasize the optimization and aggregation
of vertical craft and experience expertise into functional groupings which,
while valuable, comes at the expense of flexibility and effortless crossdepartment
or division working. So in a rapidly shifting environment we
need to work harder to find new and more agile ways to combine that vertical
expertise, blend it with more generalist skills, and establish a far greater
degree of fluidity in our resourcing. We need easier collaboration between
disciplines. Easier flow between centralized and decentralized resources.
Greater internal employee mobility. A move on from rigid functional roles
to a more skills-based approaches that can attract, retain and combine
required skills in more adept ways. Smarter outsourcing and use of external
capability to reduce reliance on owned assets. Continual modification
to free up resources and refocus on new projects and initiatives. Change
welcomed as an opportunity. And as Rita Gunther McGrath described, we
need key resources that are managed under central control and not held
hostage by local business units, and faster, more responsive organization
around opportunity rather than opportunities being squeezed into existing
structures.1
11
171
172 Flexibility
Greater advantage now comes from information efficiency, or establishing
tight customer feedback loops, easy access to key analytics, and reducing
the number of information exchanges that are needed to respond to opportunity
or demand or other key processes. It is more essential than ever that
our organizational structures reflect and enable progress towards our vision.
Strategies that are customer-centric, for example, will struggle unless structures
are adapted to also be customer focused (most, as we have already
discussed, are not). Rather than supporting limited, episodic innovation and
singular initiatives, resourcing needs to enable continuous experimentation
and multiple projects that combine to create momentum and change.
Table 11.1 summarizes the key differences between legacy and agile.

Agile structures and resourcing 173
Companies achieve great efficiencies and craft expertise through organizing
in vertical functions (marketing, sales, finance, engineering, and so on).
As organizations scale and become multi-product companies these vertical
expertise areas exist as functions within divisions that group products
together into logical areas. These multiplying silos enable functional focus
and efficiency to work at scale, but faced with rapidly shifting contexts
we need to be far more adept at combining functional expertise in different
ways to gain advantages in velocity and focus. We need more of our
expert resource to be working concurrently with other functions, far greater
emphasis on small, multi-disciplinary teams to be used to address key challenges,
energize experimentation and develop new capability, and we need
to greatly improved fluidity between central and localized, in-house and
outsourced resourcing in order to be truly responsive and to open up new
opportunity.
Concurrent running, co-located working
Traditional methods of working can often involve waterfall-driven processes
with one department completing their part of the project before handing off
to the next function to work through theirs. A product development process,
for example, may involve designers passing an initial look and feature set
to the engineers (who find ways to make it actually work), and then on
to manufacturing (who work out how to produce it), and then sales and
marketing (who decide how to sell it).
Yet as the innovation writer Steven Johnson has pointed out, the ubiquity
of this model comes from the fact that it works very well in situations
where efficiency is the most important consideration but it kills creativity
since original ideas get chipped away at every stage. In contrast,
Apple’s development model involves all the groups (design, engineering,
manufacturing, sales) meeting continuously throughout the process in an
approach that is messier and more chaotic in the early stages, but which
avoids great ideas being slowly hollowed out and becoming ghosts of
themselves:
The process is noisy and involves far more open-ended and contentious
meetings than traditional production cycles – and far more dialogue between
people versed in different disciplines, with all the translation difficulties that
creates.2
174 Flexibility
In the same way that single-team waterfall processes (like an IT development
project) can move too slowly and fail to take account of shifting
contexts and adapt accordingly, so multi-team waterfall working can make
for sluggish, arduous, and overly rigid process and progress. Sometimes it is
necessary. But often there is a better way.
Concurrent, co-located working, with all the key skills and disciplines
working on solving problems at the same time and in the same room
carries a number of key advantages. It acts to break down departmental
silos and align priorities cross-functionally since the group is working
towards a common goal. It enables different disciplines to spark off one
another and catalyse the creative process. It circumvents issues around key
input not being available when required. It allows simultaneous input from
multiple perspectives, and an ‘ideas from anywhere’ approach (the best
ideas don’t always come from where we most expect them to). It simplifies
communication and can enable greater transparency and accountability
on progress.
Co-located working with external partners (such as innovation or marketing
agencies) can enable a combined team to move at pace through greater
efficiency of communication, improved understanding of each other’s priorities,
demonstrable commitment, shared goals, smoother workflow. In other
words, a real partnership. AstraZeneca, for example, partnered with the
digital agency DigitasLBi to form a co-located Digital Innovation Group to
tackle the ‘wicked problems’ in healthcare:
A wicked problem has innumerable causes, is tough to describe, and doesn’t
have a right answer… Not only do conventional processes fail to tackle wicked
problems, but they may exacerbate situations by generating undesirable
consequences.3
Owing to the complex nature of these problems, conventional working in a
linear, sequential way gave way to iterative, highly interactive, agile working
involving a continuous process of insight gathering, building and learning
in rapid sprints throughout a 12-week innovation cycle. A highly social,
collaborative process between AstraZeneca stakeholders, the DIG teams
and the end beneficiaries, the 12-week cycles kick off with an immersion
phase, followed by rapid concepting and prototyping (Figure 11.1). This
enables multiple ideas to be worked on in parallel, using a series of gate
meetings to filter out ideas that do not deliver on the agreed conceptual
promise.
DIG has launched a succession of new (and award-winning) projects
and services including ones to help drug trial participants and heart-attack

patients, new social networks for lung cancer survivors and ethnographic

wider AstraZeneca organization.
As we will go on to discuss, if the teams working on challenges are small,
kept to a core group, not allowed to become corpulent with members whose
contribution is peripheral or required only periodically, and then empowered
to work iteratively towards a solution, then they can really move fast.
The opportunity provided by small, multi-disciplinary teams to accelerate
organizational tempo is vastly undervalued. We need a new way of working
that places far greater emphasis on their role as catalysts for a new type of
organization.
The insourcing and outsourcing dynamic
The dynamic of what companies choose to do in-house and what they
outsource to partners and third parties is a continually shifting one, yet
there is a distinct trend for organizations to facilitate greater agility by
establishing more sophisticated, nuanced and outwardly facing approaches
to partnering and outsourcing. The obvious advantages behind insourcing
include more immediate control, responsiveness and consistency, and the
opportunity to build owned capability and value over time. In many areas
(notably when dealing with areas of critical importance to the business
like the effective integration of people, data and technology that relates
to key areas of competency or customer experience, reputation or compliance)
keeping capability close at hand leads to improved responsiveness
and agility.
It often seems that with the empowerment of digital technology, companies
are doing more and more in-house. Yet the picture is more nuanced
than this suggests. A more sophisticated approach to outsourcing can
open up the opportunity to leverage a broader range of expertise, assets
and resources (wherever they sit) in ways that are more flexible, scalable,
and even cost efficient. The growth of cloud-based services has been the
great exemplar of this for a number of years, but it is just one example
of how agile organizations are cultivating increasingly networked ecosystems
of partners and resources from which they can draw. Whether it is
utilizing third-party data or stitching together remote services through APIs,
or accessing specialist expertise, assets and resourcing remotely to fulfil
specific functions, such networks can dramatically enhance organizational
Agile structures and resourcing 177
capability, help build in-house learning and capability (as a key output of
an agency or consultancy engagement, for example), and bring new levels
of flexibility and agility.
External resource can add value both at the centre (incremental improvement
of existing products, processes and services through efficiency gain,
automation, optimization) and at the edges (new ideas, consultancy around
developing new propositions, early stage capability). But you should never
outsource the future. The critical thinking, decisioning, hiring of talent, and
essential elements of customer experience – in fact, any capability that is
crucial to the long-term success of the business – should not go outside.
As example of what can happen, Clay Christensen describes how Dell in
the early 1990s were a disruptive force in part because they were able to
outsource key capabilities to Asus in Taiwan. As time went on, however, and
spurred on by Wall Street who smelled greater efficiencies, Dell expanded
their outsourcing programme to more critical parts of their business including
the management of their supply chain and the design of the computer.
By 2005 Asus had got so good at so many parts of Dell’s business that
they were able to create their own brand of computer. Over the years,
says Christensen, Dell had ‘slowly outsourced its way to mediocrity in the
consumer business’.4
One example of this is the growing approach for organizations to create
talent networks to augment internal capabilities. A combination of new
technologies, remote working capability, improved support networks and
infrastructure such as the growing global proliferation of co-working
spaces, and new business models including algorithmically managed workforces
like Uber, and crowdsourced micro-task services like Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk and Task Rabbit, have led to a notable rise in freelancing
and contracting. One study from Intuit predicts that by 2020, over
40 per cent of the American workforce (equivalent to 60 million people)
will be independent workers.5 Huge value exists in being able to tap into
specialist expertise on a more flexible basis, whether that is through the
growing number of freelance consultants, or the global range of technical
outsourcing solutions. An advanced talent network may draw from
three key sources: full-time, permanent employees; a wide-ranging pool of
specialist freelance expertise; and a pool of contracted or associate partners
and consultants (Figure 11.2).
Each organization will structure its own talent network according to its
own unique needs, but the aim is always the same: flexibility, scalability, cost
efficiency, agility.
178 Flexibility
Centralization vs decentralization,
specialists and generalists
In a digital transformation process there are key dynamics that will inevitably
see a continually evolving balance. Our ever-more complex, digitally
enabled business environment, for example, requires increasing levels of
technical and functional specialization. We need deep, vertical expertise in
key areas to optimize specific capability. But there is also greater value in
more horizontal, generalist roles that can bring diverse specialist expertise
together and marshal that capability towards achieving a shared goal.
Similarly, the dynamic between what resource is held at the centre, and
that which serves more localized needs or discrete divisions and audiences
is continually changing. The centralization of digital resource, for example,
can bring significant advantages in a transformation process including
improved governance, standards and control, greater consistency, scalability
and efficiency, and more emphasis, clarity and focus. But the risks inherent
with centralization can include a lack of integration with wider activity,
and a lack of learning in the broader business. Often, a centralized digital
team will begin to devolve executional resourcing and responsibility out to

localized areas (in a ‘hub-and-spoke’ model), and this may even eventually
involve more strategic-level decision-making. It may often be the case, for
example, that strategic direction and broad capability development sit at
the centre, while discrete strategy, plans and tactics sit locally. Overarching
governance and standards may reside centrally, but compliance and specific
rules are local. And process design is likely to be centralized, but implementation
local. But above all, there remains a requirement for a heightened
level of fluidity in resourcing between these two areas to effectively orient
resourcing to capitalize on not just exploitation but also opportunity.
The power of small teams
to drive big change
From the Founding Fathers in politics to the Royal Society in science to
Fairchild Semiconductor’s ‘traitorous eight’ in business, small groups of people
bound together by a sense of mission have changed the world for the better.
Peter Thiel
When attempting to increase tempo and momentum within organizations,
teams that work in small multi-disciplinary units (or ‘pods’, as we might call
them) can be disproportionately powerful in demonstrating new, agile, iterative
ways of working and helping to drive transformation across the business.
Work by author, Harvard professor, and specialist in team dynamics
Richard Hackman has shown the challenges inherent in attempting to accelerate
pace using large teams, the issues not only relating to the size of the
team itself, but the number of links between people and the growing burden
of communication.6 As group size increases, the number of unique links
between people also increases, but exponentially. So while a small team of 6
creates 15 links between everyone, a larger team of 12 will generate 66 links,
and a team of 50 has no fewer than 1225 links to manage. This exponential
increase means that coordination and communication costs are soon growing
at the expense of productivity.
Leaders, says Hackman, may often create oversized teams in the faulty
assumption that ‘more is better’ for team effectiveness, or due to emotional
considerations such as sharing responsibility and spreading accountability
across larger numbers of people, or for political reasons such as ensuring
that all relevant stakeholders are represented. You may then have a politically
correct team, but likely one that is incapable of moving at pace towards
its objective.
180 Flexibility
Hackman defined four key features that are critical to create an effective
team in an organization:
1 Common team tasks that work towards fulfilling a compelling vision.
2 Clear boundaries in terms of who is in the team, information flow, and
alignment with other resources, priorities, policies and teams.
3 Autonomy to work within these boundaries.
4 Stability.
These qualities take on a heightened level of significance when trying to
move fast within the agile organization. The difference, for example, that
Hackman delineates between a ‘co-acting group’ and a real team. A great
deal of organizational work is performed by groups that are commonly called
teams, but in reality are more like co-acting groups that have members who
sit in close proximity, may have the same leader, but where each member
has an individual job to do and the completion of that job does not depend
on what the others in the group do. The hope is that managers can gain the
benefits of teamwork while still directly managing the behaviours of individual
members but this is, he says, misplaced: ‘If you want the benefits of
teamwork, you have to give the team the work’.7
In the agile organization, far greater emphasis is placed on small multidisciplinary
teams where the interdependencies, work and individual
responsibilities between team members intertwine in the course of concurrent
working towards a common, shared objective. Work by Wharton Management
School professor Jennifer Mueller8 has shown that individual performance in
larger teams can suffer in comparison to those in smaller teams due to ‘relational
loss’, or the perception that individual team members are less able to
get as much support, ease of access to information or recognition in a larger
team. Momentum comes from teams becoming a real unit, improving iteratively
over time, focused on clear outcomes. As the UK Government Digital
Service was always fond of saying: ‘the unit of delivery is the team’.9
Similarly, it is essential for the team to have clear boundaries in order to
move fast. While the work doesn’t always need all team members to be in
the same location at the same time for progress to be made, lack of clarity
over who is on the team will act as a brake on momentum if key members
are juggling multiple priorities or missing from key meetings. Attempting to
establish new ways of working through a half-hearted adoption of cell-based
working that sees key members allocating only part of their time to the new
team is likely to be problematic. It requires commitment. The team needs
to be sufficiently bounded to profit from clear direction and comprehensive
Agile structures and resourcing 181
participation, while sufficiently porous to enable beneficial cross-boundary
exchanges. More than ever, agile teams need focused objectives, clear ways
of monitoring advancement towards achieving those objectives, and then
the freedom to define how they will work to create that progress.
Stories from the frontline
Gareth Kay, Co-Founder, Chapter SF: The new unit of work
It’s been widely accepted for some time that the atomic unit that unlocks
the potential of any organization is the team. What we’ve failed to realize
is that the very nature of the team has changed dramatically as technology
has allowed people to work together in new and better ways.
We are not unlocking the full potential of our teams because we are using
the wrong map to understand organizational structures today. Despite all
our talk of agile working processes and the democratization of the ‘bottoms
up’ workspace, we still envision teams operating in a rigid, post-industrial
hierarchy of command and control. Org charts are the still dominant way we
shape and present those who work with us. We see teams being bounded,
at best, by the organization and at worst by their department or discipline.
The organizations that unlock their potential see their teams quite
differently. They see the team as a group of people who come together
around a common goal. Yes, this could be a department but more likely
it will be a group of people from different disciplines, potentially working
in different countries and even different companies, who are working
together to achieve something together they wouldn’t otherwise be able to.
Research by Amy Edmonson at Harvard Business School shows that the
nature of teams is changing dramatically in response to a more fluid world.
As much as we talk about them, stable, bounded, clearly defined teams are
less and less in evidence. What she sees more of is ‘teaming’, a dynamic
activity, not a static, bounded entity. A verb rather than a noun. If we use
this map of the world, then some very different needs emerge about how to
build a world class team (of teams).
First, we need to be far more radical in our approach to bringing different
people together in different ways. We should be looking at how we can truly
diversify the talent, skills and experience we bring around a problem. This
means looking outside the ‘usual suspects’ inside an industry and looking
for inspiration outside. We should look at how we can break the approaches

Two pizza teams
Amazon is a technology company. We just happen to do retail.
Werner Vogels
Amazon are fixated on staying agile as a business as they scale. Werner Vogels,
Amazon CTO has outlined one of the key ways in which they do this.10
Scaling quickly had always been the key priority for the company. More of
a priority, he says, than maintaining a coherent architecture, which led them
to developing services based around APIs rather than direct database access.
This in turn lent itself to an organizational structure focused around small
teams typically comprised of no more than seven to eight people. These
small, nimble groups were called ‘Two-pizza teams’ since they were typically
the number of people who can be fed easily with two large pizzas. There are
hundreds of such teams in the business, each behind specific services that go
to comprise the wider Amazon offering. The Amazon home page, for example,
requires about 200 to 300 such services to construct the page.
This strategy comes right from the top of the organization, from founder
Jeff Bezos, who believes that small, nimble, networked, task-based teams are
the best way of maintaining a high degree of focus and agility. People in small
teams are more easily able to stay in touch with what other members of the
and working processes we repeat every week and replace them with new
ways of collaborating at different tempos (not everything should perhaps
be a sprint). If we are to find new solutions we need to approach different
problems with different processes, approaches, mindsets and people.
Second, organizations have to accept that their greatest ability
to create value is to act in a way that may feel initially antithetical to
everything they’ve done before. Great organizations today understand that
they are no more than a network of teams. This changes their approach
to management. They become more open and permeable and accept that
talent lies outside the organization not just within; that a coalition of talent
can get further, faster. They are less obsessed about process and more
obsessed by creating the environment and organizational underpinnings
that allow people to recombine and shapeshift without losing the
knowledge that used to be guarded within the team or department.
The team may be an old concept but teaming is the new unit of work. If
we’re to thrive we need to design and build our organizations for it.
Agile structures and resourcing 183
team are doing whereas in most large teams, regular meetings are required
to achieve the same goal. Meetings, believes Bezos, slow teams down. This
decentralized structure also brings focus. From the earliest beginnings of the
company, Bezos wanted:
… a decentralized, even disorganized company where independent ideas would
prevail over groupthink.11
Amazon structure two-pizza teams in such a way to allow for focus through
objective and direction, autonomy in prioritization and execution, and
accountability through performance measures. Each one of those small
teams was established with a ‘fitness function’, a key business metric agreed
between the senior leadership and the team lead that gives the team focus.
This autonomy enables greater entrepreneurialism, the opportunity for
greater ownership and growth.
It is a structure that is built for speed. Amazon are able to bring a new
service or product to market in 10 to 15 days. Vogels has depicted how
Amazon deliberately design for flexibility, for on-demand and, where appropriate,
for automation. Processes are distilled into their simplest form because
they have to be and it means that they can enable a culture of continuous
innovation (for example, Vogels describes Amazon Web Services, their cloud
computing division, as resembling ‘a collection of 15 or 20 or 40 startups’)
and a relentless customer focus. Any benefits accrued from additional scale
are passed on to customers, and innovation is focused on the things that will
always be important to those customers.
Amazon launches a continuous stream of new products, often with minimal
initial feature sets, and then develops additional features through close
cooperation with customers and data from customer interaction. Despite
building a huge business, Amazon have been able to retain the flexibility and
adaptability of a startup. In a world increasingly characterized by the need
to respond to and design for on-demand, there is a lesson in that for all of us.
Self-organizing, multi-disciplinary teams
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing
teams.
The Agile Manifesto
The principle of self-organizing teams is one of the foundational tenets of
agile and, like many of the practices inherent to this way of working, has
broadened out beyond the distinct agile practice area. The not insignificant
184 Flexibility
advantages inherent to self-organization include increased staff motivation,
productivity and ownership (you have, after all, chosen to work on this project
so are naturally invested and feel greater responsibility for the outputs).
But it is when self-organization is incorporated as part of a wider adoption
of new ways of working (such as agile or Scrum) that it can catalyse
greater change and continuous learning. As teams work iteratively, for example,
there is regular opportunity to optimize working patterns, processes
and behaviours. The process of embedded reflection through retrospectives
helps the self-organized team to learn and become more efficient over time
through constant inspection and adaptation without delay. Combining the
multiple disciplines needed to progress outputs in the same team, working
can be concurrent and fast. Key roles in the team can help it to function well.
Product owners or managers might act as the voice of the customer, interface
with the rest of the business, and work to prioritize and re-prioritize the
work backlog. In agile methodologies like Scrum, the ‘Scrum master’ helps
to oversee, not micro-manage but instead ensure that rules and boundaries
are respected and that barriers to progress are removed.
Richard Hackman described four key functions that must be accomplished
by an organizational unit that has work to achieve: executing work; monitoring
and managing progress; to design the performing unit (structuring
tasks, organizing application of resource and required support, establishing
norms of behaviour); and setting the direction for the team out of which
fall the necessary tasks. How we separate up these tasks and responsibilities
across management and team, he said, gives us an authority matrix that we
can use to describe different levels of authority that we might give the team:
●● Self-governing teams: the team-members have responsibility for all four
aspects (like a startup or a worker’s cooperative).
●● Self-designing teams: managers set the direction but the members have
authority over all other aspects so can modify the design of their team
and/or aspects of the organizational context in which they operate on an
ongoing basis.
●● Self-managing teams: team members are responsible for execution but
also monitoring and managing progress.
●● Manager-led teams: Managers do everything except task execution,
which is left to team members.
A key benefit of higher levels of autonomy and self-organization in teams is
the ability to more easily and continuously adapt to a changing environment
as resources are focused on achieving the job at hand rather than being at
Agile structures and resourcing 185
the mercy of organizational and managerial politics. Greater adaptation and
more emergent, fluid structures lead to greater resilience.
The process of self-organization tends to naturally align and bring
together the necessary talent needed to achieve a goal that the team is setting
out to pursue, but we need to balance this with the need to ensure specific
expertise is dedicated towards solving key challenges. Heightened levels of self-organization
can empower teams to move quickly, but as we have seen there
are different gradients of self-organization and manager/team responsibility.
Concepts such as Holacracy apply the idea of self-organization and flat
hierarchies but at scale. Holacracy is presented as the ‘complete, packaged
system for self-management in organizations’, replacing traditional management
hierarchy with ‘a new peer-to-peer “operating system” that increases
transparency, accountability, and organizational agility’.12
The system may seem like it lacks leadership or management, but as
Frederic Laloux has said: ‘… the absence of dominator hierarchy is not
the same thing as the absence of any hierarchy’.13 In Holacracy, collective
intelligence informs decision-making reducing the ability of one person to
unnecessarily put the brake on a process or hold an idea or budget hostage.
Transparency comes through visibility of responsibility rather than power.
Team members are responsible for what needs to be done, but also monitoring
and managing the progress of each other and the team as a whole.
Difficult decisions are worked through at a team level rather than pushed
up the line. It attempts to replace traditional ‘dominator hierarchies’ with
‘actualization hierarchies’ focused on recognition, influence and skill.
While Holacracy has to date been adopted by mainly smaller-scale
organizations, we can all learn from exploring different ways of devolving
responsibility and ownership throughout the organization rather than
decisions always emanating from the top. Finding the right balance is about
creating as much freedom as possible at all levels through greater autonomy
and flexibility around resourcing, while still establishing clear direction,
boundaries, governance and accountability. Above all, the over-arching
principle (again) should be to keep the unit small.
The composition of multi-disciplinary teams
Careful consideration needs to be given to the composition of these small
cell units. The key rule is to take a skills-based, rather than purely functional,
approach. Don’t feel pressured to include staff who are there to represent a
function but whose input may be incidental or infrequent. The only people
186 Flexibility
who should be included in the team are those whose skills are central to
making outputs happen, those who have direct, tangible and ongoing input.
Above all the unit should be kept to ‘two-pizza’ size.
Eric Schmidt of Google describes the people who he believes can have
the biggest potential impact within organizations (he calls them ‘smart creatives’)
14 as those who can combine a triumvirate of key skills’ areas: technical
knowledge, business acumen and creativity. We will talk more about ‘smart
creatives’ later, but this troika of skills areas has the potential to be transformational
at not just at an individual level, but at a team level as well.
While the specific roles or job titles may differ, the pattern of combining
these key capabilities in a small multifunctional team is repeated again and
again. And for good reason. We need business acumen (strategists, product
managers, product owners and so on) to align to business needs and inputs,
provide direction and prioritization, and a commercial perspective. We need
technical skills to code, build, make, engineer. And we need creative skills to
ideate, imagine and design for user need. While the balance in composition
may differ according to need, this triumvirate of skills can work on a problem
through every stage but with no single practice area leading. Each area
amplifies and extends the capabilities of the other. As Tim Malbon, founder
of product innovation agency Made By Many, has described it:
It’s a force multiplier… we’ve created a machine that renders insights and ideas
into code in almost-real-time on a continuous and self-correcting basis.15
This is the modern blueprint for a multi-disciplinary team.

Scaling agility
Big is a collection of smalls.
Nigel Bogle
New ways of working such as Agile, Lean, and Scrum and operating in
small, multi-disciplinary teams are not only the domain of startups. With
rapidly shifting contexts every company needs to become more adaptive,
iterative and emergent, and work to combine functional expertise horizontally
across the organization in smarter, more fluid ways. As Silicon Valley
entrepreneur and academician Steve Blank has pointed out a startup is not
a smaller version of a large company.
As an organization scales, functional groups are an excellent way to
optimize efficiency and craft. As it scales and diversifies further to become
multi-product, divisions (which each house their own functional groups)
allow these efficiency and expertise gains to be extended. But this comes at
the expense of structuring for the benefit of the organization, not for the
customer. Customers are horizontal. They don’t care about the differences
between sales, customer service, or marketing. They don’t care about how
company divisions are structured. They just want products that work, and
to be able to find solutions to problems easily and quickly. So the need for
more seamless customer experience and greater agility creates a heightened
horizontal tension and obligation to counteract the constraining impact
of organizational silos. Adept collection and application of data can mitigate
this (utilizing a ‘single customer view’ in order to join up customer
touchpoints and help interaction to be more personalized and intuitive,
for example). But the organizational response needs to stretch deeper into
processes, culture and, of course, structures.
This means finding better ways to combine the benefits we can derive
from unifying expertise in functional groups (HR, finance, sales, marketing,
operations), with the ability to capitalize on the agility and momentum
that can come from small, multi-disciplinary pods. Organizational systems
and ideology are weighted heavily towards optimizing efficiency through
functional groups. We need to find a new balance, one that reflects a greater
emphasis on learning, velocity, focus and flexibility through agile, iterative,
multi-functional pod working.
12
188
Scaling agility 189
More commonly iterative methodologies and pod working seeds first in
technology teams, centralized digital units, innovation or product development
labs and incubators, or standalone catalyst brands that are established to enable
a large organization to experiment with new approaches. But confining these
ways of working to small units or single teams misses the huge opportunity
that companies have to scale agility far more broadly across the organization.
We can represent this progression of agility through several distinct stages:
1 Dispersed mavericks: Restless change agents in dispersed areas of the
business recognize the need for different approaches and start to question
the status quo and agitate for change. This may initiate pilot projects
or minor revisions in local areas efforts are not joined-up and substantive
change is difficult in the face of a lack of senior support, and wider
organizational complacency.
2 Focused agility: As the strategic imperative for change takes root at
senior levels, investment and resources are allocated towards digital
capability development and innovation. New agile ways of working
become established in specific areas such as innovation units, catalyst
brands, technology teams and digital centres of excellence. Centralization
brings focus, a visible statement of intent, easier prioritization, efficiency,
better governance and commonality of approach. Iterative, sprint working
in small, multi-disciplinary teams enables faster learning and greater
experimentation, agile culture and behaviours are nurtured and protected
through senior backing and ‘translator’ roles.
3 Scaling agility: As the need to scale agility becomes more pressing, small
multi-functional pod working, and iterative experimentation is expanded
beyond tightly focused innovation, technology or digital areas more
broadly into the wider organization. This is accompanied by senior vision,
communication and support, along with a clear link between corporate
and team strategy, objectives, execution and measures. Over time the
proportion of the workforce that is working in this way increases.
4 Dispersed agility: As agility naturally scales ever wider, it becomes essential
for the business to manage the ever-fluid proportion of staff that
are working in multi-functional pods, and continually balance that with
the efficiency and craft benefits gained from functional groups. Ongoing
sensitivity to the type, scale and scope of customer needs, and the ability
of the business to respond to these and other contextual challenges is key.
The stage when we are looking to scale agility can be particularly challenging.
It is at this point that we are expanding new approaches, behaviour and culture
190 Flexibility
beyond an isolated area, so a senior mandate, permission to fail-safe but to
orient to learning becomes critical to success. Initial focus may be on setting
up small multi-functional teams to address key business challenges through
iteration and experimentation. Or establishing areas at a divisional level that
can enable the introduction of these new ways of working focused on divisional
priorities – more of a hub-and-spoke model to scaling agile working.
Exposure to agile working and culture can support wider adoption over
time. This might come via staff, functions and teams that interface regularly
with already agile areas (osmosis). Or wider assimilation through deliberately
including an ever-wider coterie of staff to experience agile working and be
included in pod team working (diffusion). Or encouraging the larger organization
to learn from catalyst brand initiatives (mother-learns-from-baby).
Businesses cannot go from a rigid, functionally oriented state to a highly
fluid, agile, learning-oriented organization overnight. The staged approach
allows for proper establishment of supporting structures and cultures, and
the proportion of workforce that is ultimately working in pod-like structures
is likely to be fluid.
To see an exemplar of scaling agile structures, we can look at Spotify.
Agile and organizational coaches at Spotify, Henrik Kniberg and Anders
Ivarsson, have detailed an approach that the company has adopted successfully,
focused on what they call Squads, Tribes, Chapters and Guilds.1 Spotify
has scaled more rapidly than most companies but the structure that they
have adopted in their engineering teams is specifically designed to maintain
an uniquely advantageous level of agility across 30 teams and three cities.
The basic unit of development at Spotify is the ‘Squad’, a small, nimble,
multi-disciplinary, autonomous self-organizing team that is designed to feel
like a mini-startup. Squads are co-located and focus on specific areas of the
product or service, incorporating all the tools and skills they need to take
an idea from design to test to release and production. Much like Amazon’s
two-pizza teams, Squads are clearly focused on a specific task and KPI.
Squads are grouped together into related product areas called ‘Tribes’.
Tribes are like the incubator for the squad mini-startups and designed to be
no larger than 100 people. Specific processes help minimize the potential of
dependencies to slow things down.
‘Chapters’ and ‘Guilds’ link Squads horizontally together, enabling some
economies of scale without sacrificing autonomy, and acting like the glue
that binds the company together. Chapters group together people with similar
functional expertise and meet regularly to share learnings. The Chapter
lead is the line manager for chapter members and has more traditional
staff-management responsibilities, but is also a member of a Squad themself
Scaling agility 191
so stays in touch with the work. Guilds are looser, more organic and widereaching
communities of interest that can stretch across the whole company
(rather than just how a Tribe like a Chapter does). They enable knowledge
and tool-sharing across a wider group.
As Kniberg and Ivarsson describe it, it is like a matrix organization but one
that is weighted towards delivery. The structure is a departure from typical
organizational approaches in that rather than people being grouped into vertical
silos defined by function, the vertical dimension is customer and product
focused, and defined by those multi-disciplinary, self-organizing, co-located
Squads, while the horizontal dimension is all about sharing knowledge, best
practice, learning and tools.
The risk in having a looser organizational structure focused around small,
nimble teams is that an increased level of complexity is created through a
greater number of dependencies, coordination issues, a possible lack of focus
on developing vertical functional expertise, and the difficulty in effectively
sharing learning horizontally across the organization. What’s interesting
about Spotify’s approach is that it specifically finds ways to avoid those potential
pitfalls, while making for a customer focused structure that is far more
flexible and empowering, and one that can be far more adaptive at scale.
Managing core teams and dependencies
When scaling agile working and small multi-functional teams through the
organization we need to remove barriers to ensure that they can move fast.
An important part of this, as we have discussed, is being ruthless about
keeping the team small. But we also need to ensure that teams have the
necessary support and input they require, what they need when they need it,
in order to generate and maintain momentum.
The model of Agile team onions (Figure 12.1), originated by Agile practitioner
Emily Webber, is a way of structuring dependencies which, in a large
organization may be required functional inputs (perhaps ops, legal, finance
and so on) that are involved in some way in delivery but which are still situated
in vertical silos, around the core team.2 The onion is a way of creating
understanding about who is in the wider team, and inviting them in without
disrupting the small (and effective) size of the core team:
This isn’t just a stakeholder map, it is about bringing the organization in and
having shared responsibility for what you are creating together.
The onion is classified thus.
192 Flexibility
Core team
●● Purpose: delivery of digital services
●● Communication: daily (all stand-ups, retrospectives, planning, show and
tells)
●● Co-located: daily, all day
●● Types of people: product owner, scrum master, developers, designers, etc.
Collaborators (who might be working on multiple teams)
●● Purpose: bring in specialist information to assist the team, assurance as
needed, reduce dependencies and blockers (open doors)
●● Communication: regularly, they come to some agile meetings
●● Co-located: on a regular basis (as a guide ~2 days a week) – this also
depends on what is needed and the phase of project – but enough to be
able to not block anything
●● Types of people: other delivery teams working within the same portfolio,
security liaison, policy liaison, portfolio manager, operations,
suppliers, etc.

Mapping out your team onion, inviting people in, agreeing expectations and
protocols establishes the right footing for it all to work. So, ultimately, an
organization may consist of many overlapping onions (Figure 12.2).

world has more recently prized leadership over managers and entrepreneurs
when, of course, all three are critical to the effective running of a business.
Yet they are very different beasts:
●● The Entrepreneur: dreams about the future, is strong on ideas, and brilliant
at vision.
●● The Leader: plans for tomorrow, is strong on people and brilliant at
behaviour.
●● The Manager: delivers today, is strong on process, and brilliant at
capability.
Entrepreneurs in companies are the ideas people who often end up being put
in charge of building new capability or business units. But once those units
are established they require managers to extract the full value or generate
sustainable sales or greater ongoing efficiencies.
Conflict can occur between entrepreneurs and managers as the former
struggle to get the latter onside with new ideas, and the latter despair of
getting the former to appreciate the nuances of running the ongoing business.
As entrepreneurs are focused more on the ideas of tomorrow, and
managers more on the business of today, the former may see the latter as
‘change blockers’. Once a new venture has been created, entrepreneurs may
be less equipped or enthused to optimize the venture on an ongoing basis
and so may be moved out of the business rather than be assigned the next
entrepreneurial challenge, resulting in innovation loss for the company. For
this reason, says David, more entrepreneurs feel that they don’t belong on
corporate world and so end up in SMEs.
But all three are, of course, essential. Leaders need entrepreneurs (to identify
and capitalize on ideas), and entrepreneurs need leaders (so that they are
not working in isolation). Both need managers who can take innovations
and make them work, and managers in turn need leaders and entrepreneurs.
Everyone has a profile that mixes these three attributes to a greater or lesser
degree, and it goes without saying that where things go wrong is where
someone’s profile is mismatched to the role that they find themselves in.
In the context of achieving change, awareness of the profiles enables you
to identify where support for the change will come from, and where there
might be blockers. In the context of a senior team in the corporate environment,
leadership may be overvalued (everyone wants to be a leader) at the
expense of entrepreneurs and managers, resulting in an imbalance.
We need to ensure that our best talent is oriented towards opportunity,
not just to efficiency. Putting the right people to work on the wrong thing
Scaling agility 195
can have a disastrous impact. Take Microsoft, a business that many believe
badly trailed its competitors in its development of key technologies including
mobile. In a 2014 Vanity Fair article on Microsoft, Steve Ballmer talked
about the cost of the misalignment of the talent that the company had:
The worst work I did was from 2001 to 2004. And the company paid a price
for bad work. I put the A-team resources on Longhorn, not on phones or
browsers. All our resources were tied up on the wrong thing.4
Researcher Simon Wardley has described an approach that brings together
the unique combination of resourcing characteristics needed to bring products
and services to life (in a concept itself adapted from Robert X Cringely’s
description of companies in terms of Commandos, Infantry and Police).5
Pioneers, settlers and town planners are each brilliant in their own way, but
demonstrate different attributes:
●● Pioneers: have the ability to explore uncharted territory and generate
entirely new concepts: ‘They show you wonder but they fail a lot.’
●● Settlers: can turn incomplete ideas into something useful for a larger audience,
make prototypes into products, commercialize, build understanding
and trust: ‘They make the possible future actually happen.’
●● Town planners: are able to industrialize young products to capitalize on
economies of scale: ‘You trust what they build. They find ways to make
things faster, better, smaller, more efficient, more economic and good
enough.’6
While pioneers will be experimenting iteratively, prototyping in-house,
using agile working and techniques, settlers may be utilizing more off-theshelf
technologies, tapping into ecosystems, using lean methodologies, and
town planners will likely be using existing tools to drive efficiency, perhaps
outsourcing, and maybe even using more traditional waterfall development.
Each of these stages are critical in the agile organization, and great people
are needed in each of these roles to create the right combination that can
not only generate new ideas, but also commercialize and scale them at pace.
There is even the potential to deploy small, multi-functional pods to fulfil
each stage of this process.
While the pioneers may logically sit within the innovation area or digital
team, and the town planners within vertical functions, the settler stage is
a key one. During this phase the concept or project may start as an early
stage prototype that has established an early value proposition and productmarket
fit, but then needs to be properly commercialized, and the business
196 Flexibility
model and proposition developed to make it repeatable and ready for scale.
The inherent dangers at this point are that the concept moves out of the
innovation area, straight into business-as-usual functions where it is saddled
with a short-term profit target and given to a functional leader and staff
who have not been invested in the idea from the start. Under these burdensome
conditions, the idea (even if it is a great one) will often wither and die.
There are several factors that can instead contribute to success:
1 A clearer metrics journey that can show early stage value before revenue
(see ‘Pirate Metrics’ in Part Two).
2 Senior patronage, and a clear understanding of the role of the new initiative
in progressing towards a long-term vision.
3 A continuum of resourcing on the project – key people who have been
there from the start continuing to work on it. The balance here is ensuring
that pioneers, adept at ideation, rapid experimentation and prototyping,
are not being forced unnecessarily to play the role of the settler.
4 Resourcing dedicated to the commercialization of early stage ideas.
Sometimes, with the right support, the same team can take an idea

through from initial concept to commercialization. But even a startup
adapts its skill base in tune with these critical stages. So more commonly
in a large organization we need committed staff with the right expertise,
or a multi-functional team specifically focused on establishing scale
and economic viability. We need not only systematic ways of testing new
ideas, but also disciplined ways of commercializing the ones that show
early stage promise.
We need to create the conditions in which each phase can feed off the others.
This is about building a systemic way to orient the organization towards not
only continuous experimentation but also continual commercialization and
scaling of early stage ideas.
Agile decision-making: flatter structures,
quicker decisions
The primary purpose of the organizational hierarchy in a company is decisionmaking
efficiency.
Ben Horowitz7
Here’s a scenario. The CEO needs to do a big review presentation. So they ask
five of their direct reports to help put it together. Those five leaders brief five
of their subordinates to compile the material. Those five subordinates brief
out another five of their juniors asking for specific information. Each of those
stages requires just two meetings between each of the individuals involved
(briefing and review), and perhaps five e-mails. A not unreasonable scenario
and yet that is already 156 people, 310 meetings, 775 e-mails for one presentation.
Over-burdensome hierarchy creates its own over-burdensome process.
And it can be paralysing.
Consider a second scenario. A team wants to implement a change that
will support one of their objectives but which impacts another team’s activity.
In an overly hierarchical business the proposal gets passed up the line
to the department head, who engages the head of the other team in trying
to win support for their initiative. The other department head consults their
own team to understand the implications of the change. In the absence of
appropriate data, the decision becomes drawn out and protracted as the
department heads go back and forth to negotiate a solution they are both
happy with. Instead of being dealt with quickly at an appropriate level,
multiple decisions are passed up the line, across, down the line, and back
again. Time passes. Projects are stalled.
198 Flexibility
In order to move quickly it is essential in a large organization (particularly
in the context of leading transformation) to invest time in understanding
where decision-making and influence resides. In other words, to know ‘who’s
who in the zoo’. Attempting to implement change that carries dependencies
without the support of key stakeholders or influencers within the organization
will at best slow things down and at worst result in failure. Simple
frameworks such as RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
are useful not only in assigning and managing responsibilities, but also in
determining the required actions necessary to smooth the process of change
and ensure continued support.
Over time, the number of managerial layers in large organizations seems
only to increase; yet flatter structures reduce unnecessary communication
and expedite speed of decision-making. The secret is to have just enough
hierarchy. Yet reaping the benefits of a flatter business is not just about
formal structures. Decision-making needs to be empowered with ease of
access to relevant data, and the kind of culture that is not suffocated by
internal politics. Effortless access to the right data at the right time (through
dashboarding, for example) can bring agility by supporting and removing
contention around a proposed course of action. Teams that have access to
relevant data make better decisions. Companies that make that data easy to
access enable their staff to make those better decisions faster.
Similarly, senior perks and other visible symbols of status might make a few
staff feel self-important but are largely counter-productive to open communication
and can be a barrier to just getting the job done. Are executive floors,
large exuberant offices, and other visible perks of seniority really necessary?
When he was CEO of successful work productivity company Evernote,
Phil Lipin said that such signals: ‘create artificial barriers to communication.
They create artificial things that people focus on rather than just getting
their job accomplished’.8 Eliminating all distractions so you can just focus
on achieving means that you attract people who are primarily motivated by
how much they achieve.
We should all be passionate in the pursuit of maintaining decision-making
structures that enable clarity of responsibility and authority while preventing
redundant or avoidable hierarchy and process.
Agile governance and the digital board
If the rate of change on the outside exceeds the rate of change on the inside, the
end is near.
Jack Welch
Scaling agility 199
Slow decision-making can be anathema to effective digital management and
transformation. As the pace of digital development accelerates and pressure
on resources intensifies, one of the key challenges that arise in organizations
undergoing digital transformation is the effective prioritization of digital
projects and developments. There is just so much to do, so many different
(and potentially competing) priorities that it can be hugely difficult for
those at the top tier to know the right thing to do (especially if their level of
knowledge of all things digital is not what it could be).
The issue is often not about the level of comparative significance attributed
to digital developments by the company board, nor their visibility
among the most senior staff of the company. A more likely scenario is that
while an organization may already have digital development as a strategic
pillar of the corporate strategy, the difficulty comes in taking account of
multiple dependencies or risk factors and in elucidating and defining a priority
list that will ensure that the most meaningful and impactful changes are
prioritized above those which may have less significance. Sometimes impact
is difficult to demonstrate or even to determine. Sometimes changes that
have short-term impact might be unfairly or misguidedly prioritized over
those with potentially much larger long-term impact. Sometimes involvement
of multiple senior-level stakeholders slows the decision-making down
to the point where the impact of development is negated.
Companies might try to mitigate this risk by appointing digitally savvy
people to the board, or having a board member take responsibility for
becoming a digital ‘champion’. Both of these options can help. Yet there
can be little substitute for a board that is conversant and experienced
as well as informed. The broader this capability across the board the
better. Every company is operating in a digitally empowered world, which
means there is now little excuse for lack of board level competency and
proficiency.
Outside of board meetings, decision-making structures need to be agile in
support of an empowered board. Clear delineation of responsibility helps.
Peter Thiel has said:
The best thing I did as a manager at PayPal, was to make every person in the
company responsible for doing just one thing. Every employee’s one thing was
unique, and everyone knew I would evaluate him only on that one thing.9
While the clarity, focus and simplicity that this brings may reap dividends for
startups and small businesses, as a company scales applying this approach
to small teams rather than individuals is likely to be easier. Clear and sensible
escalation procedures also help.
200 Flexibility
More formalized decision-making and feedback structures such as the
creation of a ‘digital board’ can, however, prove to be extremely valuable in
facilitating agile governance while providing a crucial link to most crucial
decision-making body in the company: the main board.
A ‘digital board’ might typically comprise key main board members (the
board ‘digital champion’, or Finance Director or perhaps even the Managing
Director or CEO) and other principal digital stakeholders, and becomes the
main decision-making body for the digital development roadmap, meeting
regularly to make key investment and strategy decisions.
This ensures the ongoing commitment, involvement and engagement of
key senior staff including the CEO, CFO, and/or the IT and Operations
Director, provides a crucial link between digital operations and the main
board, while still keeping the decision-making process as agile possible.

Building
the culture
to move fast
Agile is not just a process,
it defines a culture
Agile is a working process that has revolutionized the way in which technology
teams (and increasingly a wider set of functions) work but it is far more
than that. Agile defines a broader opportunity to change mindsets, behaviours,
and yes, organizational culture.
Agile practitioner Michael Sahota has written about a key distinction in
this respect: the difference between doing agile, and being agile – in other
words between adoption and transformation.1 Change agents, he says, talk
of adopting agile but rarely about transforming the culture of a company
to support the agile mindset. And without that, it fails. Sahota builds on
a model from William Schneider2 that maps four distinct organizational
culture types against a two-by-two matrix which positions people versus
company-oriented businesses on the horizontal axis against reality versus
possibility oriented companies on the vertical (Figure 13.1).
So, for example, the ‘cultivation culture’ is about succeeding by growing
people who fulfil a compelling vision, collaboration culture is about succeeding
by working together, control by getting and keeping control, competence
by being the best and so on. No one culture is better than another but while
companies may have characteristics that originate from multiple culturetypes,
they are likely to be routed in one. Other cultural elements may be
encouraged as long as they serve the dominant culture. This also enables
us to see a relationship between different culture types. Controlling organizational
cultures, for example, are more compatible with competence and
collaboration cultures than they are with cultivation.
13
202
Building the culture to move fast 203
The model is useful in thinking about where your company culture is routed,
but also in identifying potential areas of conflict. Agile culture is focused
more on collaboration and cultivation, and so arguably plays less well with
controlling cultures in particular. Conflict can arise when individual teams
or departments may have a subculture that is different to the dominant
organizational culture. These cultural mismatches can kill off new ways of
working before they have even had chance to prove their value, or cause a
long-term drift back to the old ways of doing things. It is like when a virus is
introduced into the bloodstream in our bodies, the white blood cells cluster
around it and try to kill the foreign body off. Similarly, an organization can
reject the introduction of a foreign culture system and work hard in order
to maintain the status quo.
The role of ‘translators’, or ‘interpreters’ here is key. These are roles that
can help make the new way of working make sense to the rest of the business
(and avoid triggering the antibodies). Job roles such as product managers
and project managers can help fulfil this need in these early stages.

What is digital-native culture?
You don’t create a culture. Culture happens. It’s the by-product of consistent
behaviour… real cultures are built over time. They’re the result of action, reaction,
and truth. They are nuanced, beautiful, and authentic. Real culture is patina.
Jason Fried3
Organizational culture can be the one of the biggest enablers, but also
blockers, to change. We cannot deliberately create culture overnight, nor
can we change a company’s culture at whim. But we can recognize that
there are certain essential characteristics and behaviours that are fundamental
to organizational agility, and frame the context in which they can
thrive. We can set expectation, recognize, amplify and reward, and demonstrate
through the choices that we make, the questions we ask, and our own
behaviour. In this sense, it is not about creating a digital-native culture, but
enabling a culture that is fit for a digital world.
To describe the essence of this culture, we can draw together a number of
essential ingredients. We can talk about being entrepreneurial, innovative and
experimental. About continuous learning. About being non-hierarchical and
collaborative. The importance of commercial focus, data-driven decisionmaking
and accountability. About openness and transparency. Staff who
benefit from a high degree of empowerment and autonomy. An organization
that is passionate, hungry, outwardly facing and curious.
All of these things are important. But so is how we choose to bring this to
life. Nolan Caudill, Engineering Chief of Staff at rapidly growing communication
and productivity app Slack, has written about how every company builds
products that they sell but also the culture within the company. Yet while the
former is often an explicit undertaking and the result of conscious effort:
Culture – which we understand to mean the systems that dictate how employees
relate to one another, the work to be done, and the customers – often forms
without much oversight. Like any random experiment, the results of letting
culture form unchecked can vary between fair to disastrous.4
At Slack, culture is seen as a way to not only create the environment where
people can do great work, but as a manifestation of what the company
values and as way of making explicit decisions to avoid groupthink, politics
and unhelpful concentrations of power.
This is reflected in how the work is done and decisions made, who they
choose to hire, what they choose to reward, and encapsulated in three key
values: diligence (doing the hard work to be exceptional); curiosity (not being
Building the culture to move fast 205
satisfied with the status quo, considering problems from multiple angles, asking
the right questions to the right people at the right time); and empathy (the ability
to view things through the eyes of the customer, diversity of experience).
Similarly, social technologies company Buffer focus around nine (openly
published) values that include positivity, transparency, self-improvement,
listening, and being a ‘no-ego’ do-er. Their default to openness and transparency
has seen them publish detailed monthly performance reports on
their blog,5 and even went as far as initiating an ‘open salary’ approach
based on a formula which made remuneration for employees completely
transparent.6 Buffer CEO Joel Gascoigne has expressed why openness is
so important to them: ‘Transparency breeds trust, and trust is the foundation
of great teamwork’.7 While not every company might have this level of
appetite for transparency, the point is that they are living their values openly
and demonstrably, and that is the behaviour of a confident business.

206 Flexibility
At Pinterest we bring agility to life at an organizational and individual level
through a focus on velocity and flexibility (Figure 13.2). ‘Organizational
velocity’ is about how we can create the conditions necessary to increase
velocity. This primarily involves removing roadblocks. Roadblocks show
up in an organization in many forms including lack of goal or role clarity,
decision-making or resourcing bottlenecks, and employees’ fear of taking
risks and having important yet tough conversations.
We’ve removed these roadblocks through our semi-annual planning cycle,
thoughtful cascading of critical information, and bi-weekly all company
progress meetings. When every employee consistently understands our
strategy and key priorities, they can make better, quicker trade-off decisions.
We also have clear owners for each of the company’s major objectives
who are known across the company. These individuals are accountable for
key outcomes and metrics related to the goals and have the autonomy to
make critical decisions.
At the organizational level, we create the conditions for flexibility
through strong shared values that help guide how employees approach
and complete their work. These values are built into performance reviews,
enlivened through workshops, and visible in the physical work space. We
use guiding principles when proposing a solution or course of action to
clarify what we’re optimizing for and how to think about the problem.
At the individual level, we enable velocity by helping employees feel a
sense of ownership beyond their job description and accountability through
performance expectations. Employees work towards clear, challenging
goals and have regular discussions with their manager about their progress.
Individual flexibility is facilitated through an emphasis on embedded
reflection. We’ve put significant investment into external coaches to work
with many of our leaders (not just executives). Coaches provide our leaders
with a sounding board and structured time every couple of weeks to reflect
on how things are going and where they can improve or change course.
Reflection is critical for all leaders but it’s been especially important for
us as we’ve scaled quickly. As the company grows, our leaders need to
frequently re-assess how best to allocate their time and invest their energy.
What was the best approach six months ago will frequently not be the best
approach now. I like to use two questions to help with this kind of reflection:
●● Is this the most important work I can be doing right now to make the
team and company successful?
●● Is the process / approach / strategy we used before still the most
effective approach given our current reality?
Building the culture to move fast 207
While the agile business has singular, stable, directional vision, strategy and
values, it is able to adapt at speed through enabling processes, practices and
culture.
Having posters on the walls with catchy slogans is the easy bit. To really
bring culture to life we have to see and feel it around us, in the behaviours
of those around us, in the decisions that leaders make, in the people that are
hired, in the systems that make everything work, in how we judge success,
in the patterns of recognition and reward. That is where real agility and
competitive advantage will come from. To quote from John R Childress:
‘Anyone can copy your strategy, but no one can duplicate your culture.’8
The right culture helps you to move fast
AirBnB co-founder Brian Chesky has described an office visit from entrepreneur
Peter Thiel just after they had closed their Series C funding round in 2012
in which Thiel invested US$150 million in the fledgling business. When Chesky
asked him what was the single most important piece of advice he had for them,
Thiel replied ‘Don’t f**k up the culture’. Thiel believed that it was all too easy
for the early stage culture to be destroyed as AirBnB scaled. So Chesky and his
co-founders decided that culture would be one of things they focused on above
all else. Not least because it helps you to move fast. The stronger the culture in
a business, he says, the less process that company needs:
When the culture is strong, you can trust everyone to do the right thing. People
can be independent and autonomous. They can be entrepreneurial. And if we
have a company that is entrepreneurial in spirit, we will be able to take our next
‘(wo)man on the moon’ leap.9
Process itself is, of course, not inherently bad for business, but there is the
kind that helps you to progress at pace and the kind that slows you down.
Netflix, for example, delineate between good processes that help talented
people to get more done (frequent release schedules, regular strategy and
context updates, budgetary discipline), and bad processes that can creep
in over time and often try to prevent recoverable mistakes (such as overly
complex sign-off procedures, avoidable micro-management of expenditure,
unnecessarily multi-level approvals).10
If, as Chesky defines it, culture is ‘simply a shared way of doing something
with passion…a thousand things, a thousand times’, then organizational
culture in the agile business is about enabling more intuitive decisionmaking
and autonomy, removing unnecessary process and hierarchy, and
empowering the business to move fast.
208 Flexibility
What really differentiates high-performing
teams?
This feels like something of a holy-grail question for companies, and one
that Google has undergone a lengthy quest to understand. Several years
ago they embarked on a comprehensive study, called Project Aristotle, that
studied hundreds of teams from the business in an attempt to find out what
separated the exceptional from the average. Findings from a wide-ranging
review of academic studies into how teams work were overlaid onto the
teams inside the company to try to define which factors made a difference.
After extensive research and data analysis of many different potentially
influential variable elements, there was no obvious common patterns or factors
that emerged which separated teams that were high-performing from those
that weren’t. Surprisingly, all the elements that we might expect to be influential
including team composition, longevity, degree of hierarchy, and the mix of
personality, background and skills of the team members all made no difference.
Instead, further research revealed that the group norms (‘the traditions,
behavioural standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function
when we gather’)11 that the team operated to seemed to play an important
role in how successful a team was. Analysis of over a hundred groups for
more than a year showed that the right norms could raise a group’s collective
intelligence, and the wrong ones have the opposite effect (even when
individual intelligence was high).
But while team norms differed widely in character, high-performing
teams all exhibited a high level of ‘psychological safety’. Professor Amy
Edmondson from Harvard Business School defines this as a ‘shared belief
held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risktaking’,
12 and also as describing a team climate that is ‘characterized by
interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable
being themselves’. Feeling like you can really be yourself in the team and
work environment, that you do not need to play a particular role, and that
work is more than just work, really matters. Anything that detracts from
this impacts not just employee happiness, but performance.
Similarly, research by Carnegie Mellon, MIT and Union College has
documented the existence of a collective intelligence among teams who
cooperate well that extends beyond the cognitive abilities of the group’s
individual members. Teams with the right kind of internal dynamics, and
particularly those that exhibited higher levels of ‘social sensitivity’ (how
well team members are able to perceive other team members emotions), and
Building the culture to move fast 209
those where team members were able to speak in a more equal distribution
of turn taking rather than one person in the group dominating, performed
well on a wide range of assignments. Interestingly, teams containing more
women demonstrated greater social sensitivity and in turn greater collective
intelligence compared to teams containing fewer women. As one of
the researchers noted: ‘Having a bunch of smart people in a group doesn’t
necessarily make the group smart’.13
From her work, Amy Edmondson has defined three key strategies for
leaders to create the environment in which psychological safety can work:
1 Framing work as learning problems, rather than execution problems – if
leaders can depict clearly how increased uncertainty and interdependence
means that each team member’s input matters: ‘We’ve never been here
before; we can’t know what will happen; we’ve got to have everybody’s
brains and voices in the game.’14
2 Acknowledging fallibility – simple statements or questions that acknowledge
that the leader does not have all the answers, and create permission
for input from others.
3 Model curiosity by asking a lot of questions – this creates the need to
generate answers and therefore the need for voice.
Edmondson believes that the interaction between psychological safety and
accountability, enabling questions and open discussion while holding people
accountable, can combine to create a high performing team in an uncertain
environment. Conversely, accountability without psychological safety can
create anxiety and mistakes, and maintaining the open, safe culture without
accountability means employees remain unchallenged and overly comfortable.
If combining psychological safety and accountability works at a group level
to create high performance in uncertain climates, and a collective intelligence
that is greater than the cognitive abilities of individual team members, then we
need to scale this approach across the entire organization. In 1996, Rob Goffee
and Gareth Jones described an approach to understanding organizational
culture that plotted cultures across two axes: Sociability (emotional, noninstrumental
relations, friendliness, social interaction for its own sake, ‘high
levels of unarticulated reciprocity’); and Solidarity (the ability to pursue shared
goals effectively and quickly, regardless of personal ties, relationships based on
common tasks or mutual interests).15 This defined four main cultural types:
1 Networked: High sociability, low solidarity. Characterized by high trust
and empathy, open door policies, loyal to social group rather than an
organization.
210 Flexibility
2 Mercenary: Low sociability, high solidarity. Exhibited by weak social
ties, encouraged competition between employees, high performance but
employees stay only as long as their personal goals are met.
3 Fragmented: Low sociability, low solidarity. Here there is low consciousness
of organizational objectives, a shut door policy, employees rarely
agreeing with organization objectives.
4 Communal: High sociability, high solidarity. Characterized by strong
team working, sharing the organizations mission, value, risk, and reward,
strong friendship relations.
Goffee and Jones stress that no one of these cultures is the ‘best’ option, that
there may well be advantages and disadvantages, and that different cultures
are appropriate for different business environments.
Building on this work, and that of Amy Edmondson, we can understand
that if we desire a culture that supports agility, we need to combine traits
that support psychological safety at scale including sociability, openness,
and risk without recrimination, while still optimizing for accountability
towards a shared, common objective (Figure 13.3).
Combining both creates the culture and support systems for highperforming
teams to thrive in a truly agile business.

Creating the culture for real collaboration
Having established what is needed to build a culture that empowers high
performance, we need to understand how at a team and intra-team level, we
can empower true collaboration to enable us to move fast. It is very easy
when we are trying to increase velocity as a business to over-focus on the
process and under-focus on the environment that enables speed to happen.
If it is a culture that is characterized by trust, which enables a greater degree
of unity and autonomy then we are more likely to be able to progress at
pace. There is less chance of misalignment through individual action, or
micro-management, or unnecessary explanation, updates, reporting or
supervision, which slows everything down.
Similarly, if it is a culture that embraces the kind of ‘psychological safety’
that we discussed earlier, one where staff feel like they can be their true
selves in the workplace, and one that enables healthy debate, questioning
and dissent, then there is less chance that we waste time with unnecessary
company and team politics, which again slows everything down.

212 Flexibility
Analyst Ben Thompson has described the building blocks of true collaboration
as a combination of mutual trust and respect and comfort with
dissent16 (Figure 13.4). Ben makes the point that real collaboration,
particularly cross-functional, is hard to achieve, and yet that is where the
real value lies:
As much as we glorify the solitary coder or designer, the truth is that, especially
in technology, breakthroughs are collaborative and iterative, borne of thousands
of disagreements.17
Not having the necessary cultural ingredients can lead to conflict or groupthink,
so in order to truly start to break down functional silos we need to
invest in enabling the kind of behaviours and cultural characteristics that
empower real collaboration.
The importance of trust and ‘productive
informality’
When John Boyd derived his ‘OODA loop’ approach to military strategy, he
emphasized how important trust is to the effective operation of the cycle. As
his biographer, Robert Coram describes it, the commander and subordinate
share a common outlook, trust being the force that binds the group together,
giving the subordinate greater freedom of action:
They trust each other, and this trust is the glue that holds the apparently
formless effort together. Trust emphasizes implicit over explicit communications.
Trust is the unifying concept.18
In the scenario of the battlefield, explicit communication is often simply not
fast enough. In the same way, trust in the organization is essential for it to
move fast. Overly formal or explicit language and behaviours can restrict,
impede and slow progress. A common understanding of our direction and
context combined with an environment of trust enables us to move fast.
Yet that combination needs to be actively created. Research by MIT
Sloan and London Business School (based on a survey of 11,000 senior
executives from more than 400 companies) demonstrates the weak link that
often exists in companies between strategy and execution.19 For the two
to be aligned, a strategy must be clearly articulated and comprehensively
understood. When the researchers asked people to list their company’s top
three to five priorities, only around half could list the same one priority
Building the culture to move fast 213
(even with five tries), and only a third could list the top three. Even more
surprisingly, the result was only slightly more than half for those who were
actually involved in developing the strategy.
The research also found that execution in large organizations suffers
from a lack of trust, which in turns leads to over-commitment. The findings
showed that senior managers trust their colleagues to deliver all of the time
less than 10 per cent of the time, the result being that senior managers end
up doing the job themselves, stretching themselves and their teams too thin,
letting their own commitments to other teams slip, and compounding the
problem. This enduring issue results in ‘passive commitments’, duplication
of effort, inefficiencies, and a failure to focus on or recall the firm’s priorities.
London Business School Teaching Fellow, Rebecca Homkes describes how it
is often not ill-will that lead to cross-department commitments failing:
People are taking on huge volumes of work to ensure a job well done, but they
also feel they cannot say ‘no’. The tendency is to say ‘yes’, but then certain
things just don’t get done. That’s when things start to break down.20
When trust is inherent in a culture it enables not only velocity, but acceleration.
Service design and innovation consultant Matt Edgar has described
this as ‘productive informality’.21
In high-performing teams, implicit rather than explicit communication is
emphasized, teams are more unified in achieving a common goal, we need
less forward planning, staff are collaborating as equals, and empowered
with greater freedom of action. This becomes particularly important in the
realm of customer-centric service design where the requirement is to tune in
to potentially highly differentiated needs:
Productivity in service is infinitely variable. This means that optimizing for
repeatable, well-known processes with narrow tolerance is actually the fastest
way to leave value lying on the table… Only through continuous, informal
communication can we discern and meet the full, diverse, messy, constantly
shifting range of customer needs.
The opposite scenario is characterized by non-inclusive working, late briefing
or involvement, arbitrary timelines, and detailed and rigid requirements.
When things go wrong the instinctive reaction is to impose a tighter rein,
which simply serves to move you further away from the conditions that will
most likely result in success. Instead, informality grows from trust, and trust is
earned through delivery. And so there is a virtuous circle where service productivity
builds trust, and that trust begets informality, which in turn enables
faster, richer, continual learning that is critical for any service to be productive.
214 Flexibility
Read my user manual
Effective collaboration comes from the right environment, but also
the right behaviours, and our ability to work well with diverse people.
This becomes even more critical when we are working in small, multifunctional
units. Whether the team is fixed or flexible, we need to understand
how others like to work, not just our own preferences. When we work
with people for the first time or when someone new is on-boarded it can
take time to understand that person, but if we are moving at pace there
is benefit in understanding that person and how they like to work as fast
as possible. Ivar Kroghrud, co-founder of feedback management business
Questback, advocates the idea of creating a one-page ‘user-manual’ to help
others quickly grasp how best to work with you and to shorten the learning
curve when building new teams, noting that if you want to get extraordinary
results then you have to play to individual team members’ strengths.22
Adam Bryant of The New York Times, built on this idea to develop a
set of questions relevant to senior leaders (and others in the workplace)
to help build their own user manual. These questions focus around them
as individuals (such as: What are some honest, unfiltered things about
you? What drives you nuts? What are your quirks? How can people earn
an extra gold star with you? What qualities do you particularly value
in people who work with you? What are some things that people might
misunderstand about you that you should clarify?). But there are also
questions relating to how you interact with others (including: How do
you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents? What’s
the best way to communicate with you? What’s the best way to convince
you to do something? How do you like to give feedback? How do you like
to get feedback?).23
It can take time to learn how best to collaborate with co-workers, but
adopting simple and transparent hacks such as one-page user manuals to
facilitate working at pace means that actually working at pace is far more
likely to happen.

A blueprint
for flexibility:
autonomy, mastery
and purpose
Our massive employee engagement
problem
One of the greatest and yet still relatively undiscussed global corporate
productivity issues is the seemingly huge employee engagement problem.
Gallup’s 2013 State of the Global Workplace study1 surveyed 230,000
workers from 142 countries. It found that only 13 per cent of workers feel
engaged by their jobs (described as psychologically committed to their jobs,
likely to be making positive contributions); 63 per cent are ‘not engaged’
(lack motivation, putting less effort in, especially discretionary effort
towards organizational goals), and 24 per cent are ‘actively disengaged’
(unhappy, unproductive, liable to spread negativity). According to Gallup,2
this translates roughly into 900 million not engaged and 340 million actively
disengaged workers around the world. It is a bleak, disheartening picture.
Looking regionally, the United States and Canada have the highest
proportion of engaged workers (at 29 per cent) but one of the interesting
nuances to these figures was that when employee engagement is broken
down by company size it reveals that a much larger proportion of employees
who work in small companies (10 people or fewer) are engaged at work
compared with those who work in larger companies. Gallup has estimated
that actively disengaged employees cost the United States $450 billion
to $550 billion in lost productivity per year.3 Their research4 shows that
employee engagement is strongly connected to an organization’s financial
success, and business outcomes such as profitability, productivity and even
14
217
218 Flexibility
customer engagement. Data from The State of the American Workplace
report, for example, shows that:
… companies with 9.3 engaged employees for every actively disengaged
employee in 2010–2011 experienced 147% higher earnings per share (EPS) on
average in 2011–2012 compared with their competition.5
The research found that over the same time period companies that had
a lower average of 2.6 engaged employees for every actively disengaged
employee experienced 2 per cent lower EPS compared with their competition.
The exponential boost in earnings attributable to a higher engagement
ratio, they conclude, is a competitive advantage that business leaders cannot
afford to ignore.
Mapping strategy and culture to motivation
My old boss Jim Barksdale was fond of saying: ‘We take care of the people,
the products, and the profits – in that order’. It’s a simple saying, but it’s deep.
‘Taking care of the people’ is the most difficult of the three by far and if you
don’t do it, the other two won’t matter. Taking care of the people means that
your company is a good place to work. Most workplaces are far from good.
As organizations grow large, important work can go unnoticed, the hardest
workers can get passed over by the best politicians, and bureaucratic processes
can choke out the creativity and remove all the joy.
Ben Horowitz6
Sometimes, large organizations seem almost uniquely designed to suck the
motivation out of their staff. And yet, when it comes to agility and moving
fast, motivation and engagement are absolutely key. In his book Drive,7
Dan Pink makes a cogent, convincing and convention-challenging argument
about the limitation of money in driving performance and satisfaction in
the workplace, and how what really motivates us is autonomy (the ability
to make decisions that can make a difference), mastery (how people can
be rewarded for progress, and getting better and better at what they do),
and purpose (working towards a vision or purpose that is important to us).
Intuitively this makes sense, but this argument is supported by a plethora of
academic studies and research.
Given how critical staff motivation is to organizational performance, it
seems strange that in most companies, so few organizational constructs are
focused around these principles. Yet they provide us with a compelling and
A blueprint for flexibility 219
effective way of framing how we can map organizational strategy, process,
culture and structures to outputs in the agile business. The point being,
again, that becoming more agile as an organization is not only about technology
and processes, but also about the people and culture.
Autonomy
Knowledge workers have to manage themselves. They have to have autonomy.
Peter Drucker8
Where did it all go wrong? Data from the 2016 Edelman Trust Barometer, a
global study with over 33,000 participants, demonstrates that one in three
workers don’t trust their employer, that trust decreases as you go down an
organization’s hierarchy (the proportion of staff who say they trust their
organization at executive level is 64 per cent of executives, at manager level
is 51 per cent of managers, and rank and file level is 48 per cent), and that for
information on the company employees trust peers more than CEOs.9 And
yet, as we discussed earlier, trust is essential not only to effective collaboration
but to moving fast. A true learning culture can only exist if employees
are enabled with the right tools and processes, and then trusted to learn
from their failures as well as their successes. Overly restrictive procedures
and micro-management kills any chance of creating a culture of ownership
and responsibility.
After flirting with a completely flat organization in 2002, Google realized
that some degree of hierarchy in the company helped in prioritization,
the communication of strategy, ensuring that processes were aligned with
objectives, and facilitating inter and intra-team working. But they still kept
that hierarchy to a minimum. Now they have only four visible, meaningful
levels: individual contributor, manager, director and vice president. Rather
than micro-managing, managers are focused on creating the right environment
for great work and outputs. Beyond that, staff are given autonomy
to fulfil objectives in the way that they believed would be most successful.
A focus on outputs and results rather than inputs helps to keep teams on
track and support this freedom.
When Amazon established their two-pizza team model, they structured
in such a way to allow for focus through objective and direction, autonomy
in prioritization and execution, and accountability through performance
measures. Each one of those small teams was established with a ‘fitness
function’, a key business metric agreed between the senior leadership and
220 Flexibility
the team lead who gives the team focus. This autonomy enables greater
entrepreneurialism, the opportunity for greater ownership and growth. The
value in the organization is naturally oriented towards performance rather
than presentation, great ideas and problem solving rather than managing
upwards, expertise and capability rather than status or job title. To quote
VC Ben Horowitz:
In well-run organizations people can focus on their work (as opposed to politics
and bureaucratic procedures) and have confidence that if they get their work
done, good things will happen both for the company and them personally. By
contrast, in a poorly run organization, people spend much of their time fighting
organizational boundaries and broken processes.10
Netflix believes that most companies naturally curtail freedom and autonomy
as they scale. As organizational complexity increases, talent density
decreases, heightening the need for over-burdensome process, which worsens
the talent drain. In the short term the well-optimized, process-driven,
efficient company may be successful but then it is unable to adapt quickly
to context changes since process-adherence becomes what is valued, there
are ever-fewer ‘curious innovator-mavericks’ introducing new thinking, and
growing irrelevance ensues. CEO Reed Hastings:
Our model is to increase employee freedom as we grow, rather than to limit it,
to continue to attract and nourish innovative people, so we have a better chance
of long-term, continued success.11
Instead, Hastings advocates eliminating distracting process and rules,
enabling a culture that values simplicity, and increasing talent density at a
faster rate than growth in complexity. Creating an environment characterized
by informal running and the freedom to make an impact but also a
culture that celebrates self-discipline and high performance serves to maintain
agility at scale but also attract the best talent.
This requires the right framework within which to bring autonomy alive.
In Part Two we talked about how the high operational tempo that characterized
Blitzkrieg enabled frontline commanders to have the freedom to
respond quicker to shifting scenarios. Schwerpunkt (or the underlying goal,
or intent) gave them the clarity of direction, but Fingerspitzengefuhl (or
fingertip feel) allowed the flexibility to make rapid, intuitive decisions in the
face of fluid situations. This is how autonomy empowers agility.
Netflix describe this as ‘highly aligned’ but ‘loosely coupled’. The former
means that the strategy and goals are clear, specific and broadly understood,
but also that team interactions are focused on strategy and goals rather than
A blueprint for flexibility 221
just tactics. The investment in management time is in being transparent,
articulate and perceptive. Being ‘loosely coupled’ means that cross-functional
meetings are kept focused on strategy and goals. This requires a high level
of trust on tactics and a low level of preview or approval between groups
in order to facilitate moving fast, and leaders proactive in reaching out as
needed for coordination and perspective, or doing ‘post-mortems’ to ensure
alignment.
Frontline autonomy only works if we set the right guidelines, boundaries,
direction and measures and then get out of the way. But it also
needs us to be able to internalize the external. If employees (particularly
digital-native talent) feel that they have out-of-work behaviour that is
highly empowered by digital technologies and connections, yet conversely
experience restrictive practices, technologies and expectations within the
workplace they will not stick around for long. In fact they will probably
leave and launch the next disruptive startup to attack your position in the
market. As organizations, we need to pay attention to changes in consumer
behaviour and norms around social behaviours and acceptance not only
to produce better customer experiences but also better employee environments.
We need to empower the people closest to the customers to make
suggestions and be able to implement changes that benefit both customer
and employee. Looking from the inside out means that we fall behind. It
should be outside in.
Mastery
In the agile organization, mastery means empowering staff to not only learn
and improve but also to visibly see the results of their learning. The role of
data, in supporting data-driven decision-making but also tracking individual
and team progress is central to this idea. In Part Three we looked at how
using OKRs can tie execution to strategy and provide a universal framework
for tracking objectives and performance. Making performance visible
in real-time through dashboarding is also a powerful way to demonstrate
impact and motivate improvement. As an example, the UK Government
Digital Service have created public dashboards that show real-time performance
across 803 services (just 541 of them account for 2.4 billion completed
transactions per year at time of writing).12
A data-driven approach to employee performance and well-being has
been championed by Laszlo Bock, long-time Head of People Operations at
Google. Recognizing the paucity of data in the field of human resourcing,
222 Flexibility
he initiated a long-term study involving thousands of Googlers in a bi-annual
survey called ‘gDNA’. Bock also established a team of people at Google,
under Prasad Setty, focused on so-called ‘People Analytics’, who are entirely
devoted to expanding a data-driven approach. Work by this team has already
led Google to evolve its recruiting practices, downplaying the importance of
college degrees in favour of ‘intellectual humility’ and other softer qualities
(as discussed later in this Part).
Harvard Business School professor David Garvin has described how the
People Analytics team launched a set of research questions which became
Project Oxygen, another long-term research and training programme that
seeks to identify, measure and improve key management behaviours.13
Through the accumulation and analysis of multiple data points relating
to management and employee effectiveness (including employee surveys,
performance reviews, exit interviews, and interviews with high and low
scoring managers), the team leading the programme were able to show that
even small incremental improvements in manager effectiveness had significant
impacts.
Google had expanded data-driven decision-making from its traditional
areas of application (product development, marketing) into assessing the
effectiveness of management itself. Unsurprisingly, there was a high degree
of correlation between managers that scored high on quality scores, and
the satisfaction of the employees in their teams. The team delved deeper
into the data to identify specific traits exhibited by high-scoring managers,
alighting on eight key behaviours. A good manager:
1 Is a good coach.
2 Empowers the team and does not micro-manage.
3 Expresses interest in and concern for team members’ success and personal
well-being.
4 Is productive and results-oriented.
5 Is a good communicator – listens and shares information.
6 Helps with career development.
7 Has a clear vision and strategy for the team.
8 Has key technical skills that help them advise the team.
These key behaviours, primarily focused on leaders of small or mediumsized
teams, incorporated the kind of elements that might be thought of as
classic good management techniques (including communication, team and
individual development, autonomy and empowerment) but are ones that
A blueprint for flexibility 223
in reality are often neglected. It is also notable how softer qualities such as
being a good coach, being engaged in employee well-being, and communication
of team vision and strategy ranks higher than having specific
technical skills.
The project has led to a quantifiable and wide-ranging improvement in
management effectiveness scores over time, helped the company develop
a common language and expectation around management, and impacted
positively on employee perception of working at Google.
It is important that we recognize that mastery and autonomy go handin-
hand. Laszlo Bock and his team have deliberately taken power and authority
over employees at Google away from managers, meaning that decisions
over recruitment, performance rating, salaries or awards are not the jurisdiction
of one person, but a group of peers or a dedicated team. Younger
employees (often grouped as ‘millennials’) increasingly desire both the freedom
to make the key decisions that impact the area that they are responsible
for, and the support to help them get there. One survey by Intelligence Group
found that 72 per cent of ‘millennials’ want to be their own boss at work,
and that 79 per cent wanted their superiors to act as coaches or mentors.14
In this context, the old-style performance review, often conducted infrequently
(and locked into an annual or bi-annual frequency) can do more
harm than good. A succession of companies including Accenture, Deloitte,
Microsoft and Adobe have moved away from these old-style reviews and
replaced them with simpler, more focused evaluation processes that unfold
incrementally throughout the year. When Deloitte conducted a review of
their old-style performance review system it was discovered that the review
cycle including administration, meetings and rating was consuming around
2 million hours a year (mostly in discussing the ratings rather than the actual
performance).15 In the context of more fluid, iterative working and embedded
reflection time, there should be multiple opportunities for feedback. If
there are not, you are not doing it right.
The antithesis of this is valuing upwards management over real measures
of output. As Peter Thiel puts it:
In the most dysfunctional organizations, signaling that work is being done
becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work (if
this describes your company, you should quit now).16
In addition to improving visibility of performance data through dashboarding,
and more regular feedback, simple tools and hacks can facilitate
better working in flatter, and more decentralized hierarchies. The system of
‘Snippets’ (originated at Google but now widely used in technology-driven
224 Flexibility
and increasingly other businesses), involves staff writing down on e-mail
what they have achieved in the past week, and what they are setting out to
achieve in the coming one. This is compiled into a public forum and distributed
as a transparent but simple way to ensure that employees take the time
to reflect on progress and plans, and are more connected to their work.
The ‘Snippets’ system (and others like it) create minimal time disruption but
maximum transparency, helping to log progress and reduce internal politics.
Improved performance transparency through data, visible learning,
embedded reflection, combined with the autonomy to move at pace: these
are all elements that not only intuitively feel right, but drive exceptional
performance.
Purpose
Much has been written about the importance of purpose to business and
brands, but perhaps one of the most compelling arguments comes from
Simon Sinek and his concept of the ‘golden circle’. Sinek argues that people
don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.17 If we consider the way
in which the brain works, our neocortex deals with rational and analytical
thought and language, and that aligns to the ‘what’. But we ignore the ‘why’
at our peril since this speaks to the limbic brain, which has no capacity for
language but is central to how we feel, behave and make decisions.
This is powerful not only in attracting customers but also talented
employees. A compelling mission, cause or belief catalyses loyalty, alignment
and motivation. People who want to make a difference in the world are
attracted to organizations who themselves are setting out to achieve what
no other company can do. Shared passion creates an imperative to do great
work but also a great environment in which to do that work. As exceptional
talent becomes more selective about where it wants to work, and employer
brands become more transparent, organizations that do not have a compelling
purpose will fail.
This clarity of purpose needs to run through the organization. Pixar, one
of the most successful film businesses of all time, has a creative culture that
relies on an interpretation of leadership firmly routed in vision and purpose.
Ed Catmull, Pixar President, has said:
We say we are director led, which implies they make all the final decisions, [but]
what it means to us is the director has to lead… and the way we can tell when
they are not leading is if people say ‘we are not following’.18
A blueprint for flexibility 225
Author Adam Grant has demonstrated why purpose is so powerful.19 Working
with employees of a university fundraising call-centre, he divided them into
three groups: a control group; a group who read stories from other employees
about the benefits of the job; and a group who read stories from students
who had received a scholarship about how it had changed their lives. The first
two groups saw no difference in performance. The third group however, grew
their weekly pledges from 9 to 23 per week and their weekly fundraising by
143 per cent. Extending the study to see what would happen if another group
of fundraisers actually met some recipients of scholarships, he found that the
weekly fundraising for that group went up by 400 per cent. Creating a significance
for the work beyond money, it seems, leads to far greater performance.
Purpose brings meaning, and meaning brings connection.

Digital-native
talent
Hiring smart
In Good to Great,1 Jim Collins’s research emphasized just what a difference
finding the right people to fill the right positions in a company makes to that
company’s performance. This intuitively feels like something that should
be obvious, and yet it is one of the hardest things to actually get right. Not
least because of the (internal and external) pressure that often exists to fill
an important position in a timely manner.
Collins found that one of the characteristics of the leaders of ‘good to
great’ companies was that they kept searching for the right person if they
were not categorically sure that the candidates in front of them were not
absolutely right. They were also great at ensuring that they positioned their
best employees in the optimum opportunities for growth in the business
(rather than solving everyday problems). And they focused on character,
ideals, values (that match those of the business), behaviour, work ethic as
well as (and sometimes as a higher priority than) direct experience. In short,
they valued people for who they were and not just what they could do for
you, and demonstrated attributes themselves that they also looked for in
others like a disciplined work ethic mixed with a sense of personal responsibility,
of cultivating passion and an entrepreneurial spirit.
Earlier we discussed Eric Schmidt’s concept of ‘Smart Creatives’, or the
individuals who can combine technical knowledge, business expertise and
creativity and really transform organizational capability (‘when you put
today’s technology tools in their hands and give them lots of freedom, they
can do amazing things, amazingly fast’). The empowerment of digital technologies
is dramatically amplifying the potential of exceptional talent to
make a difference to the business in which they work. In their research
into star performers in 21st-century organizations, Herman Aguinis of the
George Washington University and Ernest O’Boyle of the University of
Iowa, argue that the nature of modern work has led to the emergence of a
15
227
228 Flexibility
few individuals who contribute disproportionately to outputs: ‘instead of a
massive group of average performers dominating … through sheer numbers,
a small group of elite performers (dominate) through massive performance’.2
Instead of following a normal distribution, individual performance follows
an underlying power law distribution.
Yet the competition around exceptional digital talent is such that creating
the environment in which such talent can thrive is essential, not a niceto-
have. As is taking the time and space to find them. Google front-load
their people investment, spending an unusually high proportion of money
and time on attracting, evaluating and cultivating new employees since they
believe that talent is a major pressure (‘Our greatest single constraint on
growth has always, always been our ability to find great people.’ Laszlo
Bock).3 Patrick Collison, founder of the (rapidly growing) payment technologies
company Stripe has articulated how important it has been for them
to take their time to make sure they hire the best talent. It was six months
before they had hired their first two people, and another six months before
they had hired the next few.4 Peter Thiel talks about how recruitment is a
core competency for any company and should never be outsourced.
When Laszlo Bock reviewed the outputs of Google’s extensive employee
research, he noted that school and college performance correlated poorly
with predicting ultimate performance. Instead, Google have found that
structured behavioural interviews involving a more consistent standard for
assessing people is more useful than highly individualized interviews from
different managers. Recruiting managers are encouraged to ask candidates
to give examples of situations where they have solved difficult problems in
the past. Such questions about direct experience enables better assessment of
how candidates have reacted in a genuine situation as well as revealing good
insight into what they consider to be difficult. While educational qualifications
don’t hurt, and while vertical or technical skills are important for a significant
proportion of roles, the importance of softer skills is really emphasized:
For every job… the No. 1 thing we look for is general cognitive ability, and it’s
not I.Q. It’s learning ability. It’s the ability to process on the fly. It’s the ability
to pull together disparate bits of information.
There is priority attributed to qualities such as ownership and humility,
the latter in the context of intellectual humility, to be committed to a line
or argument but then be willing to change their point of view when new
data arises.
As well as intellectual humility, traditional forms of candidate selection
often undervalue soft skills at the expense of direct experience. While the
Digital-native talent 229
latter is, of course, important it is perhaps easier to quantify than softer
skills such as articulation and persuasiveness and yet these latter attributes
can mean the difference between an applicant who proves to be competent
and one whose contribution is extraordinary. Staff who can effectively
articulate complex digital concepts or ideas (particularly to non-digital
specialists), and are persuasive in winning support from people (particularly
those in other teams or departments) can be enormously valuable.
Culture fit, or how well a candidate’s qualities align with the culture,
purpose and values of the organization can be another difficult aspect to get
right, and one that feels tricky to systematize. Yet it is a critical part of the
hiring process for the digital-native business. As an example, Anurag Gupta,
who runs data warehousing and database solutions at Amazon (Amazon
Redshift and Amazon Aurora), talks about how half the interview time
should focus on culture fit, and how essential it therefore is to have absolute
clarity about what your company culture is, and what it is not.5 Amazon
have spent time defining their core leadership principles and have not only
detailed them on their website but also thought about what those principles
mean for every job at every level, and brought them to life through the
language used in interviews, one-to-ones with existing staff, and in performance
reviews.
The leadership principles include many qualities that we have discussed
already such as customer obsession, ownership, thinking big, the ability to
invent and simplify, a bias toward action, recruiting the best talent, relentlessly
high standards, but also to have good instinct, and to be vocally
self-critical when appropriate.6
The difference between good and great in talent has never been greater,
nor more fundamental to organizational performance in a digitally empowered
world.
Peacocks, penguins, and pie bakers
There are two kinds of people and organizations in the world: eaters and
bakers. Eaters want a bigger slice of an existing pie; bakers want to make a
bigger pie. Eaters think that if they win, you lose, and if you win, they lose.
Bakers think that everyone can win with a bigger pie.
Guy Kawasaki7
We need more pie bakers in the world. To move fast we need people who
can see the bigger picture, who embrace positive change as an opportunity,
230 Flexibility
and are optimistic about their ability to change the world around them.
But we also need to create an environment in which many different types
of people can thrive. Complex problems require diversity to solve them,
and solve them well. Author Scott Page has made a compelling case for
how diversity supports not only better problem solving, but better predictive
capability, defining four key diversity dimensions: diverse perspectives
(how we represent or envision differently); diverse interpretations (how we
classify); diverse heuristics (the ways in which we generate solutions); and
diverse predictive models (how we extrapolate analysis or stories).8
Like the famed fable about A Peacock in the Land of Penguins,9 we
need to be able to celebrate and combine very different attributes. While
the penguins are those who maintain order, and keep the system running,
the peacocks are the mavericks who create the opportunity for innovative
thinking and creative leaps forward. We need to celebrate non-conformism
as much as we revere efficiency. We need both to flourish if we are to survive.
Redefining effective leadership
for the digital age
During the research conducted for this book, one of the most interesting
pieces of feedback came in the area of leadership, and notably on the value
of softer skills. Traditional leadership characteristics such as having a strong
commercial focus or being visionary, inspiring or clear-minded and actionoriented
when it was needed were, of course, still seen as being important,
but there was consistent feedback about the increasing value in ‘softer’ qualities
such as curiosity, empathy, collaboration, creativity and adaptability.
This concurs with research from Wharton University which posits that
leadership styles need to change in the context of the shift in business
models, new sources of value and new types of relationship with suppliers,
partners, customers that digital has enabled.10 While more traditional
‘command and control’ leadership styles were still valid in some scenarios,
leaders need to increasingly embrace the role of collaborator or co-creator.
Where command and control assumes most of the key insights will come
from the top of the organization, the modern reality is increasingly about
an emphasis on ideas and insights from wherever, meaning that leaders need
to draw on a wider range of leadership styles to reflect this broader set of
value sources. As more business models rely on the creation of technology,
or on so-called ‘network orchestration’ involving value being derived from
Digital-native talent 231
more intangible assets such as relationships, leadership styles that prioritize
collaboration or co-creation become more important.
IDEO founder Tim Brown has also argued that the traditional way in
which we have thought about leadership as ‘leading from the front’ with
someone at the top making all the decisions, is not the most effective way
of unlocking the kind of creativity in an organization that is so crucial in an
environment that dictates a need to constantly evolve. He frames the role of
the leader as an explorer – someone who can set the direction but also ask
the best questions. Modern, successful leadership, he says, is like a dance:
It’s about the effective playing of a number of different leadership roles
depending on the moment and the circumstances and having the skill to move
between those stances as needs require.11
In the digital age, effective leadership is increasingly not about telling people
what to do, but more about inspiring, nurturing, persuading. It is less about
directing, and more about empowerment, empathy and cultivation. It is less
about control and more about setting the right context to enable great work.
It is about having the determination and persistence to pursue a compelling
vision, but having the humility to learn, and to know when to change direction.
It is not about coercion, it is about bringing people on the journey with you.
Key takeouts
In this Part we have discussed how human-centred flexibility in culture,
resourcing and behaviours can create the enabling factors and environment
to catalyse real change and agility. Key takeouts include:
1 Pay attention to the balance between in-house and outsourced, central
and local, and specialist and generalist resourcing, but above all maintain
a heightened level of fluidity to enable responsiveness.
2 Use small multi-functional teams, working concurrently in iterative
sprints, and co-located, in order to drive organizational momentum.
Consider how to combine business, technical and creative skills, and
utilize the power of self-organization to catalyse motivation and productivity
but above all, keep the teams small.
3 Scale agility by focusing small, multi-functional units on key business or
innovation challenges, and support the core team with collaborators and
supporters. Recognize the need for pioneers, settlers and town planners,
and pay particular attention to nurturing early stage concepts as they
232 Flexibility
come out of the innovation lab or digital team. Establish appropriate
digital or change governance, perhaps through a ‘digital board’.
4 Build the culture to move fast by promoting mutual trust and respect
alongside comfort with dissent. Promote, recognize and exhibit behaviours
that can nurture a digital-native culture. Encourage ’psychological
safety’ and ‘productive informality’ in the work environment to lead to
high performance.
5 Build engagement, motivation and productivity through empowering
autonomy, mastery and purpose.
6 Spend a disproportionate amount of focus and time on hiring the exceptional
talent that can really make the difference.
7 Draw from a wider set of leadership qualities, and recognize the value in
softer qualities in bringing people on the journey with you.
8 Celebrate the mavericks.

Part five
The transformation
journey
True digital transformation is an enormously complex and manifold beast
that is intertwined with a broad range of dependencies and factors. So there
is no one definitive path to getting it right. Yet there are some useful ways of
thinking about the process of transformation that we have collected here in
our final Part. We are calling this Part ‘The Transformation Journey’ because
that’s exactly what it is – a journey. Change is a process, not an event.
The five dimensions of change
The journey to becoming a truly agile business is a multifaceted one involving
a number of fundamental aspects. We can therefore frame this transformation
in the context of five core dimensions:
1 Personal: the individual journey, the challenges, the ups and downs, the
highs and lows.
2 Principles: reorienting around a new foundational organizing idea and
vision, and mapping the values, behaviours and outcomes to that vision.
3 Process: the structure and process of change. The route into transformation,
the key stages and progression of the journey.
4 Practice: change through behaviour, systematizing change.
5 Pace: the time dimension. The speed of change of component parts, and
the tempo of the transformation process itself.
235
236 The transformation journey
Dimension one: personal
The transformation leader and
the ‘hero’s journey’
Digital transformation, like any change process, is hard. And it takes time.
Potentially, a long time. Perhaps even years. Leading this change, therefore,
can be a soul-crushing, thankless, morale-sapping, attritional task. But don’t
let us put you off. It can also be the most rewarding work you’ll ever do. An
unmissable opportunity to affect real change in a company. Visible change
to the fundamental way in which that company works. Tangible benefits
that can make the difference between whether that company prospers, or
doesn’t even survive.
It’s an adventure. But it’s not for everyone. The transformation leader
needs to be optimistic, determined, and above all, resilient. People used to
talk about the change management process in terms of the Kubler-Ross
model for the ‘5 Stages of Grief’ (Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and
Acceptance). The digital transformation leader will likely find that they need
to deal with these reactions from many different sources and all at once.
They may well face their own emotional ‘hype cycle’ (akin to the famous
Gartner Hype Cycle) where initial excitement around the potential to make
real, lasting change soon peaks in the face of the sheer challenge of trying
to create change in the face of wearying inertia. But then, just when it seems
to reach its most difficult point, a small success shows what’s possible. And
then another, and another. And hope, energy, momentum and motivation
build until we’re truly ‘in the zone’ (Figure P5.1).
So who are these heroes? It is critical, of course, that the impetus and
support for digital transformation comes right from the very top of the
organization. But more often it will be a Chief Digital Officer, Director of
Transformation, or a dedicated board member who will be charged with
leading the change process. These are leaders with energy, enthusiasm, a
thick skin, resilience and a passion to make things better. They can keep
focused on underlying needs rather than becoming distracted by the
complexity and messiness that surrounds change, or the intrusive nature of
the internal politics that that brings. They are the type of leader who can
articulate a vision and then enthuse people to follow them on the journey
to realizing it. They are not fazed by the fact that if they do their job well,
The transformation journey 237
their job will eventually disappear as new practices, a new culture, a new
organization takes shape and becomes the norm. Their job is essentially to
make themselves redundant, but the knowledge and experience they’ll gain
is priceless.

Stories from the frontline
Eva Appelbaum, Partner Digital Talent @Work and former Head of Digital
Marketing Transformation, BBC: The importance of resilience
Leading digital transformation is hard. It is challenging, and it is
invigorating, but it is also extremely taxing. Looming over us is the fact that
most transformation programmes fail. And this is the case even when the
transformation entails moving from one known, fixed state to another. With
digital, we have the added pressure of a future in constant flux and even
the current state has not solidified enough to give us any certainties to
make decisions off of.
So to lead digital transformation you either need to suspend all disbelief
and jettison the organization towards a future ‘you’ see clearly, or, give in
to the uncertainty and do your best to shepherd your businesses towards
a hazy unknown. Either of these approaches require a leadership style
and competencies that stretch way beyond technological know-how or
commercial acumen.
238 The transformation journey
Much has been said about digital leadership and the need to develop
leaders who are more agile, curious, collaborative and so forth. Digital
transformation in particular requires leaders who can lead with strong
emotional intelligence, and who are as comfortable with uncertainty and
intuition, as they are with data and process.
However, there is another side to leading transformation that is less
spoken about, less acknowledged – and that is the personal resilience
and strength it takes to hold these roles. Leading digital transformation
means accepting a difficult, sometimes impossible mission. Stats tell you
that it is unlikely you will deliver everything you set out to achieve. The
business’s expectations are often unrealistic to begin with. Sometimes you
do not have enough resource, budget or buy-in to fully disrupt what needs
to be disrupted. Other times the board has bought in too much, believing
digital to be some sort of magic bullet, which will only disappoint in the
end. Typically, you have no blueprint for change in your sector, as very few
businesses are that far ahead of you on the journey. Your transformation
vision is a mix of gut decision-making and peering into the proverbial
crystal ball.
As a digital transformation leader you are simultaneously telling the
story of change, running the agile programmes to drive change, leading
your team, managing up, managing down, convincing some stakeholders
that ‘digital’ IS in fact important, and convincing others that it is not going
to solve everything, promoting innovation on one hand, while trying to stop
too much investment in shiny but ineffective distractions on the other, all
the while being seen as a potential threat to other ambitious leaders in the
business.
And in the end, you will find that you have a very short life-cycle. Most
transformational leaders come into a business with an aura around them,
and for about six months, maybe a year, will be trusted as the champion
of change with a Midas touch. It is in everyone’s interest to believe in
you. But by year two, the shine wears off, and by year three everyone is
bored of your song and dance, and probably starts questioning what you
have really delivered anyway. You start to look stale. Unfortunately, truly
impactful digital transformation often takes a lot longer than three years!
In order to keep the aura alive, to keep everyone on board the journey and
evolve the narrative, transformational leaders have to expend a lot of their
own personal energy over years keeping momentum going, telling and
retelling a constantly evolving story, networking and keeping everyone
on side. This can take a huge toll on the individual and it helps to have
The transformation journey 239
Building a movement for change
How do we bring people on the journey with us? Once we have made the
case for change and created the positive urgency needed to counteract the
forces of inertia, we need the engagement of those who can make the change
happen. There are several powerful tools we can use here:
1 Work towards a shared vision. The key word here is ‘shared’. People are
far more motivated to work towards a vision if they feel ownership in
helping to shape what that end point is and how it is achieved. Framing
the way forwards as a choice between two mutually exclusive options
(perhaps as simple as the choice between doing nothing and taking
decisive action) helps a broader constituency within the business feel as
though they are part of a deliberate choice about where the business is
going. An inclusive approach is far more likely to result in greater ownership
and appropriate behaviour change than a diktat from the top. Even
better if we can create a real movement for change by framing the choice
as a genuine call to arms, an insurgency against the slide into irrelevance.
2 Use the power of empathy. This involves enabling stakeholders to see the
world through the eyes of customers, to see the real pain points in current
processes or approaches (customer journey mapping or other forms of
immersion are excellent ways to do this). Design firm IDEO talk about
‘Transformative Empathy’, and how easy it is for key stakeholders in
a business to become far removed from their customers, and difficult
then for them to imagine how things could be different. Immersion in a
a strong balance outside of your working life to give you the reserves
needed to persevere.
In the end, there is usually an in-built hard stop to your efforts. The
point at which, if successful, you are able to integrate ‘digital’ into the
businesses and effectively make yourself obsolete. And the hardest truth
of all – the glory of your efforts often come after that point, and the kudos
will go to others.
This is why the real differentiator for truly outstanding digital
transformation leaders is personal and emotional resilience. People who
thrive on this challenge and can take pleasure in the outcomes, despite the
mission impossible.

different perspective can free up thinking and gain alignment on the real
problems that need to be solved.
3 Make them look good, help them do their job better. Everyone likes to
do well, to be recognized for great work, or to find better ways to achieve
objectives. Framing progress or projects in ways that enable people to
understand how it will benefit them is a simple, but very powerful way to
gain engagement.
4 Use the power of advocacy. Creating an expanding network of influencers
and champions to spread new thinking through the organization helps
build social proof, amplify influence and extend behaviour change. As an
example of the power of wider employee digital advocacy Barclays Bank
implemented a scheme called ‘Digital Eagles’ that created 20,000 staff
champions who each volunteer their time to help explain technologies to
other staff and to customers. Drawn from multiple functions, the eagles are
responsible for championing the use of new technologies at a grassroots
level but also running ‘tea and teach’ sessions designed to answer their
customer’s questions about digital. Hundreds of workshops have trained
thousands of people over the course of the programme, creating a network
of proponents for learning digital skills across the company. A partnership
with the Young Rewired State organization has even seen the launch of
‘tech accelerators’ in over 1,500 branches in the UK. As the community
has grown, so has the waiting list to become a Digital Eagle. For Barclays,
they have gained not only a grassroots movement for empowering digital
change, but new ways to identify talent and manage career development.
Leading a group of people who are creating real change within a much
bigger organization can sometimes feel like leading an insurgency. As people,
we have a strong instinct to belong to small groups defined by clear purpose
and understanding, and if done in a positive way this tribalism can help
build momentum. Tribe members support one another in an environment
where respect and status comes from contribution value and outputs rather
than job title or how many people you manage. Loyalty, shared purpose,
strong bonds, and shared and individual accountability are all characteristics
of belonging to a tribe. As Sebastian Junger has said:
Humans don’t mind hardship, in fact they thrive on it; what they mind is not
feeling necessary. Modern society has perfected the art of making people not feel
necessary.1
In his book on tribalism, Junger goes on to talk about how human beings
have three basic needs to be content (with strong echoes of the autonomy,
The transformation journey 241
mastery and purpose that we discussed in Part Four): to feel competent at
what they do; to feel authentic in their lives; and to feel connected to others.
Work conducted by anthropologist Christopher Boehm has demonstrated
that human groups have long been at their most productive and successful
when there is an absence of arbitrary authority, and when moral behaviour
stems from group pressure with good actions (like doing something for
another person) being recognized and rewarded and bad behaviours (most
notably a failure to share) being punished.2 As Junger says:
The beauty and the tragedy of the modern world is that it eliminates many
situations that require people to demonstrate a commitment to the collective good.
We are wired to want to help one another. So organizational momentum has
its foundations in a company’s ability to be able to harness our fundamental
need to share, feel connected, and work productively towards a common
purpose with other people. Technology is the enabler.
Dealing with negativity
As we discussed earlier, leading change inevitably results in the need to face
up to a not insignificant amount of negative reaction along the way. So
it’s as well to be prepared for what Dr John Gottman (Professor Emeritus
of Psychology at the University of Washington) has identified as the ‘four
horsemen’ – the four key reasons why work relationships fail:3
1 Criticism: while complaints focus on specific behaviour, criticism might
attack the character of the person.
2 Contempt: open signs of disrespect, perhaps coming from an assumed or
relative position of authority.
3 Defensiveness: often a form of self-protection.
4 Stonewalling: when one person closes off from the interaction.
Handled badly and in the wrong circumstances, these behaviours can serve
to amplify each other, so while a degree of misunderstanding, conflict or
negativity (particularly from those in the wider organization that are resistant
to change) is inevitable, it’s sensible to prepare strategies for dealing with
it. While not necessarily feeling like the most natural thing to do, making
efforts to empathize with the potential reasons for negativity can often help
to diffuse conflict. We need to remove the language and behaviour of blame
from situations as much as possible. Caroline Webb, in the excellent book
How To Have A Good Day: Harness the power of behavioural science to
242 The transformation journey
transform your working life4 tells how helpful it is to assume that you are a
good person, but in bad circumstances or just having a bad day.
The motivation inherent in pursuing a shared vision, and the support that
we can draw from the like-minded collaborators around us can go a long
way to combating the negative impacts of conflict. But the work of creating
a culture of appreciation, respect, constructive feedback, and healthy rather
than negative dissent should never cease.
Dimension two: principles
The organizing idea
Our second dimension comes from the need in any change process to set
out the vision and direction for change, and provide structure to how we
can reorient the business around some foundational principles, values and
behaviours. Our favourite framework for this comes from Steven Anderson
(Future Kings Ltd) and Jonathan Lovatt-Young (Love Experience Ltd) who
have built a one-page framework to encapsulate the key elements (the planks
and the pillars) of an agile organizational strategy (Figure P5.2). The framework
is useful in helping to orient the direction and activity of diverse
teams working concurrently on multiple work streams, potentially across
numerous initiatives and touchpoints, and motivate a tribe of change agents
around a singular organizing idea and vision, providing a clear link with the
strategy, execution and customer experience benefits that feed off from it.
Working from the top of the framework down:
1 The Organizing Idea: the overarching statement or principle which
defines the fundamental orientation for the business. This is what drives
the company at its most elemental level.
2 Purpose: a related purpose provides the reason that the company exists.
3 Vision: the longer-term view of the world we are building or contributing
to. Although the strategy will come to life through the pillars we expand
on below, it’s also possible to capture an overarching strategic statement
at this point.
These planks are supported by three sets of pillars that support and fulfil our
vision, purpose and organizing thought. These are set out as key component
blocks (captured as single words):

244 The transformation journey
4 Values: the things that the organization believes in.
5 Experience principles and behaviours: sets out what these values feel like
as a customer experience and the behaviours by those in the organization
who can bring these values to life (it’s also possible to take these customer
experience principles further to determine what functional user experience
assets can really bring this to life).
6 Operating model: characterizes the change state that is required to fulfil
these customer experience principles and related behaviours.
7 Customer benefits: defines the tangible benefits for the end user ensuring
again that everything we do is brought back to customer need.
This framework can be used as the basis for a series of workshops that can
draw out and inform the key planks and their supporting pillars.
The benefit of representing this framework on a single page is that it
encapsulates in the simplest but most powerful form what the organization
is setting out to achieve and the expected behaviours and customer benefits
that support that. It can be circulated to new and existing employees as an
uncomplicated, transparent way of communicating vision and expectation,
rather than this critical information being buried in lengthy documentation
or impenetrable company manuals. It can help align functional and small
multi-disciplinary teams to head in the same direction, and provide a solid
basis for greater ownership and autonomy.
Dimension three: process
The process and structure of digital transformation
In his 1996 book Leading Change,5 John Kotter famously laid out a sensible
eight-step process for change that became one of the most widely respected
and quoted change management models. The eight steps were (to paraphrase):
1 Establish a sense of urgency: through analysis of market or competitive
realities, major opportunities or crises and potential crises.
2 Form a powerful guiding coalition: establish a senior group who can lead
the change.
3 Create a vision: to provide direction, and support that with a strategy for
activation.
4 Communicate that vision: repeated communication, and setting an example
via the guiding coalition.
The transformation journey 245
5 Empower others to act on the vision: remove barriers, change systems
and structures to prevent change being undermined.
6 Plan for and create short-term wins: recognition and reward of visible
performance wins.
7 Consolidate improvements and keep the momentum for change moving:
more systems change, hiring, reinvigorating with new projects.
8 Institutionalize the new approaches: visibly link new behaviours to
corporate success, leadership development and succession.
In his 2014 follow-up book, Accelerate6 (subtitled ‘Building strategic agility
for a faster-moving world’), Kotter updated the eight-step process in some
key ways:
1 Where the 1996 version recommended responding to and generating
episodic change in sequential and relatively rigid ways, the updated model
suggested that the steps should be run concurrently and continuously.
2 Similarly, focusing on a linear progression characterized by doing one
thing well at each stage before moving on is replaced with a continuous
search for, and activation of new opportunities.
3 The idea of a small, guiding coalition in the old model is replaced with the
idea of the engine for change coming from a large, diverse ‘volunteer army’.
4 Where the old model recommended operating within the existing hierarchy,
the new one proposed a network-like function that could work in
flexible and agile ways in conjunction with the traditional hierarchy.
Kotter’s updating of his model makes intuitive sense in the context of the
fast-moving world in which we now operate. We should, after all, not take
a waterfall approach to becoming more agile. But we still need a route into
digital transformation, to be able to track progress against key elements of
change, and there are some unique attributes to the process of digital transformation
that enable us to augment existing thinking with the new.
Our framework builds on existing change management thinking to
propose a more digital-native framework for change. One that utilizes much
of what we have discussed so far in this book. The key to digital transformation
is about generating velocity (and momentum), and combining that
with the adroit application of focus (vision, strategy, execution), and the
environment and culture that enables change to happen. The new reality, as
Kotter’s update suggests, is that this will not be a linear, waterfall process.
As we work to become more agile we need to be agile in iterating and adapting
the process to respond to ever-shifting contexts. We need to move away
246 The transformation journey
from a linear transition model to one where we can run multiple elements
concurrently. We need to move on from the idea that this is a story with a
beginning, middle and an end. It is, instead, an evolution to a new form of
organization that is in a continuous state of organizational flex and flow.
Our model, the Agile Spiral (Figure P5.3) comprises three foundational
components:
1 Situation and Story: creating the reason and impetus for change. We need
to fully appreciate the new contexts that shape the world we now exist
in (competitive, customer and company), where we are now and how we
need to respond to these challenges. Then, we need to set out our new
vision and direction, and the elemental components that can get us there.
Storytelling is critical to any transformation process, not least in bringing
people on the journey with us, so how we conceive, craft and tell our
story is fundamental to success. The key parts to this story are therefore:
a Redefine: to understand and define why the world has changed forever.
Show how the new world will result in winners and losers, why fundamental
change is necessary, and what happens if we do nothing.
b Visualize: to visualize the promised land, frame the choice open to us,
define and bring to life your organizing thought, related purpose and
vision for reaching the promised land.
c Map: to set out the component elements of change, define approaches
to data, technology, structures, process, culture. Show how they can
overcome obstacles to progress, and how the company can make the
change come true. Map the dependencies that will enable success.
2 Energize and Enable: having crafted the vision and the story for change,
we need to not just execute, but energize the drivers of change, marshal
resource, remove barriers, build momentum and amplify positives. We
need to prioritize and reprioritize to bring focus and give direction to the
momentum. The essential ingredients here include:
a Communicate: Find the most compelling way to tell the story – tell it,
tell it again, never tire of telling it. Live it through behaviour, expectation
and the questions you ask everyday.
b Lead: Leading the insurgency – the transformation leader, the support
and involvement of the senior leadership team, ongoing communication
and support through the digital board, removing barriers to progress.
c Focus: Gather the insurgents – centralize resource and initiatives (digital
centre of excellence, innovation hub, catalyst brand) to bring focus
The transformation journey 247
and catalyse change. Prioritize and reprioritize – fix the basics, continuously
track performance and progress, but optimize for momentum
(the biggest impact first) to address key business challenges and continuously
search for new opportunity.
d Execute: Work iteratively in small, multi-functional teams to escalate
experimentation and learning and build momentum. Nurture new
cultures and ways of working through translator roles, by empowering
autonomy and encouraging psychological safety and accountability.
e Capture: Create some highly visible quick wins to create the space to
grow, and celebrate and amplify those wins.

Dimension four: practice
Change through behaviour
Dr B J Fogg (founder of the Persuasive Tech Lab at Stanford University)
has defined long-term behaviour change as coming from three key sources:
an epiphany; a change of context; and the cumulative impact of tiny habits
over time.7 Framing the context for change, the new reality, and the new
vision for addressing that reality in the ways that we discussed earlier can
lead to the realization of the need to shift direction. We can change the
context around decision-making, processes, structures, expectation and
environment in the ways that we have also discussed at length throughout
the process of change. But it is the everyday behaviours and the culture that
supports and surrounds them that will ensure lasting, embedded change.
Fogg also says that behaviour comes from the combination of three elements
at the same time: the trigger, motivation and ability. If one of these elements
is missing, then a behaviour doesn’t occur.8 This being the case, to encourage
new behaviours we need to ensure that the motivation and ability to
respond to triggers in a different way is present. In other words we need to
create the reason for people to respond differently, and equip them with the
capability to do so.
Real transformation comes from bringing a compelling long-term vision
to life through everyday approaches, defaults and behaviours. In order to
The transformation journey 249
truly change behaviour we need a deliberate shift in the conscious choices
that we make, but also shifts in the habitual behaviours, decisions and
routines that shape much of corporate life.
Remaking organizational habits
All our life is but a mass of habits.
William James
Old habits die hard, or so the phrase goes. The behaviours we repeat are
imprinted as patterns in our neural pathways, unconscious routines that we
regularly follow. The more we repeat a process the stronger the link between
the context and the action becomes, so increasing automatic behaviour.
Organizations are comprised of people and so just as people develop habits
over time, so might companies. These might be habits of thinking (like the
kind of ‘toxic assumptions’ we described earlier in the book), or habits of
doing. If a habit is an acquired behaviour pattern that is followed until it
becomes almost involuntary or automatic, then an organizational habit is
a customary practice or an inveterate response to a stimulus that is often
accepted, unthinking, deep-rooted. Transforming an organization means
that we not only have to be aware of what these organizational habits are,
but also how powerful they can be in resisting and also enabling change.
In his book on The Power of Habit,9 Charles Duhigg talks about just how
powerful habits can be in shaping behaviour. A study by researchers David
Neal, Wendy Wood and Jeffrey Quinn at Duke University,10 for example,
estimated that habits, rather than conscious decision-making, shape up to
45 per cent of the choices we make every day. The best way of changing a
habit or ridding ourselves of a bad one, says Duhigg, is to replace it with
another habit. This involves recognizing three things:
1 The cues that trigger the start of the habit.
2 The action you take.
3 The benefit you get from doing it.
Breaking it down like this helps us to understand that habits are comprised of
several different elements, each of which might be challenged and changed.
The cues, routines and rewards that comprise the habits that people acquire
enable us to interrogate their origins and what bolsters them. Cues trigger
an action, a reward reinforces it, a routine develops. Understanding this in
the context of both personal habits as well as organizational habits gives a
250 The transformation journey
far greater opportunity to reform habits, and in the context of digital transformation,
make habits our friend rather than our enemy.
With cues, says Duhigg, at the moment we feel the urge for the habit we
want to change, we need to ask ourselves questions around our situation
(Where are we? What just happened? Who else is involved? What did we
just do? What emotion are we feeling?) that will help us identify the most
commonly occurring cue.
With rewards, we need to understand the need that the habit is satisfying
(for example, is it our need for status? Or ego? Or gratification or some
kind?). Once the reward has been identified we can test that diagnosis by
substituting another reward or experiment further with other rewards until
we have found the correct one.
Having identified the cue and the reward, we can then change the habit
by inserting a new routine.11 This new activity can then still be triggered by
the old cue, and deliver the same old reward. Duhigg suggests writing a plan
for change along the lines of: ‘When (insert cue), I will (insert new routine),
because it provides me with (insert reward)’.
When bringing change to a company, we therefore need not only to be
aware of what organizational habits have developed that support and reinforce
outdated ways of working, but what the cues and rewards are that are
associated with that routine. We must identify the times when old routines
are no longer appropriate or are even falling apart (perhaps due to a crisis of
some kind) and utilize that opportunity to bring in a new routine.
We must also focus on what Duhigg calls ‘Keystone Habits’, the particularly
significant behaviours that can act to create a culture within a company
and ‘unlock all these other patterns in someone’s life or in an organization’.
Such keystone habits are more important than others since they can
start a chain reaction, shifting other habits as they change, and starting a
process that over time can transform a far wider set of behaviours. In order
to identify keystone habits, Duhigg suggests focusing on the three key characteristics
that they all share:
1 Keystone habits create small wins, are places from where momentum can
build, and are typically characterized by giving you lots of small senses of
victory.
2 They also create new platforms or a new basis from which other habits
can emerge (they serve as ‘the soil from which other habits can grow’).
3 They change our sense of what is possible, or give us confidence, and so
establish a culture where an attribute or virtue (like change, or perseverance
or excellence) seemingly becomes contagious.12
The transformation journey 251
Duhigg uses the Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) as an example
of a company that transformed through a focus on keystone habits.13 As a
newly installed CEO, Paul O’Neill was expected by analysts to focus directly
on worker relations (15,000 workers had recently gone on strike), efficiency
drives, margins and profits, or new markets. Instead, O’Neill surprised
everyone by announcing that his top priority was going to be worker safety,
and that his mission was to make Alcoa the safest company in the United
States with a record of zero employee injuries.
Despite analyst scepticism, this focus on how better practices and habits
could improve employee safety catalysed a whole series of improvements
meaning that Alcoa became a far more efficient and profitable business. Within
a year, profits had hit a record high, and over the next 13 years of O’Neill’s
tenure, Alcoa’s market capitalization rose by US$27 billion and its net income
rose to become five times larger than it was when O’Neill took over. It turns
out that the focus on worker safety engendered an environment characterized
by greater employee trust and more open communication of ideas, which led to
significant improvements in efficiency. Focusing on worker safety as a keystone
habit had catalysed a positive change to the culture of the entire company.
So, what might be the keystone habits in your organization? The answer
will likely be different in different organizations, but when thinking about
digital transformation the keystone habits that matter will likely be those
behaviours and approaches that are fundamental to the day-to-day operations
of the business, yet can also catalyse new ways of working across
a broad spectrum of functions and roles. Perhaps that might be how the
organization uses data in its everyday operations, or behaviours around
openness and transparency, or approaches towards risk and experimentation.
Whatever keystone habit is identified as sufficiently broad-based yet
impactful, it is critical that the subsequent strategic focus must be brought
to life in the very fabric of what the organization does every day.
Developing systematic change
As we’ve said earlier in this book, change is a process, not an event. That
means that in order to embed long-term and impactful change, targets
are not enough. Change needs to be systematic. In How To Fail at Almost
Everything and Still Win Big14 Scott Adams (the creator of Dilbert) defines
this difference as:
If you do something every day, it’s a system. If you’re waiting to achieve it
someday in the future, it’s a goal.
252 The transformation journey
If a goal is a target that you set to achieve at some point in the future, a
system is a change in behaviour, a way of continually looking for better
options or creating the right habits to build towards success. Systems, says
Adams, are ultimately more powerful than goals:
Goal-oriented people exist in a state of continuous pre-success failure at
best, and permanent failure at worst if things never work out. Systems people
succeed every time they apply their systems, in the sense that they did what
they intended to do. The goals people are fighting the feeling of discouragement
at each turn. The systems people are feeling good every time they apply their
system. That’s a big difference in terms of maintaining your personal energy in
the right direction.
This can make a significant difference in keeping energy and momentum
going in the right direction. Adams gives a few examples to make his point,
a simple one being setting a goal to lose weight (something that may be
difficult to maintain motivation for) as compared with learning a systematic
way to eat better (and substituting willpower for knowledge).
Companies love setting goals. They are nice and tangible, give a good
sense of direction, and can give clarity on what targets to achieve and where
activity should be directed. The classic scenario of a CEO announcing a new
strategic direction, and a new set of targets to facilitate the new strategy,
plays out often. What businesses are much less adept at doing, however,
is developing systems that will enable change to happen. The trouble with
isolated goals is that unless there is more fundamental change in behaviours,
processes, skills and incentives, those goals will likely never be achieved. In
this scenario, not only will the change effort fail, but also staff may well
become demotivated, and even lose trust in the ability of senior management
to lead change. Changing everyday behaviour, orientation and defaults
are fundamental ways to systematize change and create lasting transformation.
So while goals are good, finding ways to change, recognize and reward
behaviours to create a new system is better.
Think, feel, know
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but
expecting different results.
Albert Einstein
A key way to think about changing everyday behaviour is to consider
the factors that shape it. Author Clive Hyland has written about a
The transformation journey 253
simple behavioural model (expanding on a coaching framework originally
created by Darren Shirlaw)15 based on three key structures of the
brain, and the way in which it works in order to represent how our
everyday behaviour (in relationships, team working and leadership) is
shaped:16
1 Think: from the cortex (the grey outer mass of the brain). This is the
domain of logic, reason and rational processing. The domain of selfawareness,
sense-making, the rules of social engagement.
2 Feel: from the limbic region (in the middle of the brain). This is the
domain of the senses, emotions, relationships, connections with others,
and is most closely linked to the heart. It is about the personal, the subjective,
the desire to bond and to form groups.
3 Know: from the basal region of the brain (just above the spinal column).
This is the domain of instinct, intuition, ‘gut feel’. The so-called ‘reptilian
brain’.
Each of these areas of the brain wields its own type of influence over our
behaviour, and particular types of response may become more dominant
over time, notably in response to specific circumstances. The thinking style,
for example, might elicit the need for structure, logical argument and clarity
of thought or method. The feeling style may make decisions based more
on emotive reasons, or be influenced more by close associates. They may be
more immediate, perceptive, creative. The knowing style are more intuitive,
using ‘gut feel’ to inform decisions, and keen to get things done without
distraction.
This is useful is a number of ways. It can be helpful in understanding
the reasons behind certain behaviours, or empathizing with where people
are coming from. It can be advantageous to consider how a great team will
naturally need a combination of styles drawn from all three areas, and how
different people in the team might map to different roles, and combine to
greater effect. As Clive Hyland says:
… if people are developed in the right cultural environment they will inspire and
energize one another to higher levels of achievement…
It can also be fruitful as a way to understand how best to connect with and
engage others in order to bring them on the journey with us. And it is useful
as a way to understand how we might map new behaviours to particular
styles, and therefore inform what levers we need to pull in order to affect
behaviour change.
254 The transformation journey
Dimension five: pace
Our fifth dimension draws in the key dimension of time, notably in enabling
us to understand the varying tempo inherent to different elements of change,
and to better manage the pace of the change process itself.
Managing the pace of transformation: pace layering
It’s important to recognize that along the transformation journey, not
everything changes at the same pace. Writer Stewart Brand expounded
the concept of pace layering in his book The Clock of the Long Now.17
Pace layering sets out six layers that function and evolve simultaneously
at different speeds within society. From fastest to slowest: fashion;
commerce; infrastructure; governance; culture; nature. In 2012, Gartner
then used pace layering as a way to describe the different layers of an
organizational technology and application strategy. From fastest to slowest:
systems of innovation (characterized by experimentation); systems
of differentiation (supporting processes that are different from competitors);
systems of record (supporting core processes which may not be
unique).18
In the same way, there will be layers and elements of the digital transformation
process that will develop and evolve at different timescales.
Broadly, from fastest to slowest: while there will be fundamental customer
needs that do not change, or that develop very slowly, it is likely that we
will need to respond to rapidly shifting customer interaction on a continuous
basis; similarly while there will be basic approaches and procedures
that will remain essential and consistent, it is also likely that we will need
to adapt tactics, processes and workflow rapidly to respond to shifting
requirements; as we’ve discussed earlier, resources need to be fluid and
adaptive, so may change but will likely need to be modified at a slower
pace than the practices and execution that they enable; our overarching
strategy and governance is also adaptive, but changes more slowly than
the tactics that they inform and oversee; our vision may adapt but should
remain relatively settled and anchored; and lastly while we can take steps
to begin cultural change at the earliest opportunity, this takes the longest
time to transform.
A pace-layered approach to digital transformation might, therefore, look
like Figure P5.4.
The transformation journey 255
The productive zone: the balance between comfort
and urgency
Dr Ronald Heifetz of the Center For Public Leadership at Harvard University has
delineated a clear differentiation (in his book Practice of Adaptive Leadership)19
between what he calls ‘technical change’ and ‘adaptive change’. Broadly speaking,
he describes technical change as the type of change that addresses more
tangible things such as products, procedures or processes, whereas adaptive
change is that which is more concerned with less tangible human aspects such
as attitudes, thinking, beliefs, values and behavioural change.20
Adaptive challenges, he says, have a different timeframe to technical
problems. The latter might cause a high level of disturbance that will then
trigger an organizational response, but since the organization is typically
already well equipped with relevant knowledge, cultural assumptions and
capability to deal with such a challenge, a solution may quickly be found.
Adaptive challenges are different. Instead of being problems that might
be solved rapidly with existing expertise, they require ongoing experimentation,
learning, behavioural and attitudinal change from multiple parts of the
organization.

256 The transformation journey
Heifetz argues that we are often quite poor at distinguishing the difference
between these two types of change, and yet the response required is very
different. Technical change is focused on fixes to simpler problems that do not
require a change to the system in which they exist. Adaptive change, however,
is about more fundamental shifts to the system or environment in which the
company operates, and therefore demands different thinking, the learning of
new skills, and more disruptive forms of innovation. The former helps maintain
the status quo, the latter is much harder to achieve since people are much more
ready to embrace technical change than they are the more elemental adaptive
change. Making changes to the system is something that the system itself resists.
Our argument in this book has been that businesses are increasingly facing
complex, adaptive challenges that require far deeper change than the quick,
easy fixes that might be more suited to technical challenges. In this scenario,
staff will need to feel comfortable with a certain degree of ambiguity and have
an ongoing commitment to the longer-term vision, which dictates that while
clarity and communication of vision is key, leadership might well be more
about asking the right questions rather than providing the final solution.
A key challenge of ‘adaptive leadership’, as Heifetz calls it, is to help staff
to distinguish what from the past is worth building on, and what needs to be
discarded. In this sense, he says, successful adaptations are ‘both conservative
and progressive’. As they help people to navigate through a period of
potentially significant disturbance, the adaptive leader needs to be patient
and persistent, determined and resilient in order to prevent the system from
slipping back into its old ways.
Heifetz describes the ‘productive zone of disequilibrium’, whereby the
focus and pressure is high enough to create forward momentum and engagement,
but not so high that it creates unmanageable levels of pressure that
might lead to unhappiness, chaos or the wrong kind of disruption. Building
on this idea, the secret of managing effective transformation is working
within these boundaries. We need to create sufficient ferment, positive restlessness
and impetus to move beyond complacency and comfort zones,
and to break the forces of inertia. Not reaching this threshold will mean
that transformation efforts will be stifled before they have even begun. But
moving beyond the limits of tolerance may result in breaking key components
of the business needed to ensure positive outcomes (Figure P5.5).
Our job, in leading transformation is to stay within the ‘productive transformation
zone’. At the boundaries of this zone will be signals that we have
either not gone far enough to create movement and momentum, or that we
are starting to break things. The signs that you haven’t reached the threshold
for change are likely to be:
The transformation journey 257
1 Behaviour – no visible changes to behaviour, no ownership for change.
2 Inertia – change too slow, old relationship capital still dominates.
3 Drift – the business starts to drift immediately back to the old ways of
doing things.
4 Innovation – marginal improvements rather than breakthrough innovation,
no change to rate of innovation/experimentation.
5 Complacency – people still within their comfort zone, not exhibiting
changed behaviour or priorities.
The signs that you’re exceeding the limit of tolerance are likely to be:
1 Morale – dispirited workforce, lack of belief in leadership.
2 Performance – lack of attention to the core business, outputs suffer,
performance declines rapidly.
3 Behaviour – becomes overly pressured, unpredictable, or characterized
by unwanted shortcuts.
4 Talent – the most talented people start to leave, challenges in retaining
the best staff.
5 Focus and governance – unfocused or poorly thought through innovation
initiatives, disjointed focus, breakdown in governance processes and
structures.

258 The transformation journey
The workings of an organization, says Heifetz, can be like dancing on a
dance floor. When you’re busy dancing you only really notice what is immediately
around you, but the adaptive leader needs to periodically ‘get on
the balcony’ to see the wider picture of what’s happening, and gain a true
perspective in order to avoid applying technical solutions to adaptive challenges.
This is also true of digital transformation. Every now and then we
need to take a step back to look for the signals that can tell us whether we
are still in the productive zone of transformation or not.
Staying agile
The danger of drift
Once we have begun to create real momentum for change the work, of
course, does not stop there. A company that does not keep pushing the drivers
for change will lose momentum in the same way that a car that runs out
of petrol will coast to a stop. As we mentioned in Part One of this book, this
is not a transformation with a beginning, middle and an end, it is journey to
becoming a new type of organization that is characterized itself by continuous
change, fluidity and rapid adaptation. Losing momentum in the renewal
process means losing performance, position and advantage.
Analysis by Boston Consulting Group found that 75 per cent of transformation
efforts ultimately fail (only 25 per cent having outperformed in
the long term).21 Their research indicated two common trajectories whereby
a period of short-term recovery (typically following an initial streamlining
process to reduce inefficiencies) was followed either by long-term slow
decline or less commonly by long-term reinvigoration of growth and performance.
Which ‘chapter two’ trajectory (following the ‘chapter one’ efficiency
drive) a company followed was determined by their commitment to creating
lasting change, deploy, grow and innovate around a new vision, model and/
or strategy and then refine it over a multiyear period.
Success was dependent on many of the factors that we’ve discussed already
in the book: a conscious decision to move beyond efficiency and refocus on
growth and innovation; the creation of room for experimentation and separation
of new business models from legacy operations, coupled with a new
and clear shift in strategy; an appetite to challenge the old assumptions, ask
the big questions and reinvent business models; multi-dimensional innovation;
determination in taking the long view, sticking to the vision over a
long period of time, and persisting through internal resistance and setbacks;
The transformation journey 259
evolving transformation through test and learn, deploying a portfolio of
initiatives to drive growth, and constant adaptation of a flexible plan.
Interestingly, the research also revealed a number of key traps from those
that attempted transformation but ultimately failed. To paraphrase:
●● The early-wins trap: calling victory too early, after initial gains in efficiency,
and failing to move to ‘chapter two’ and create lasting change.
●● The efficiency trap: over-lengthy and enthusiastic cost-cutting and efficiency
drives.
●● The legacy trap: not moving on from legacy assumptions and ways of
working.
●● The proportionality trap: dabbling in change (eg a small-scale series of
pilots) rather than properly addressing the scale of the challenge with a
fundamental and scaled response.
●● The false certainty trap: sticking to a rigid transformation plan instead
of iterating and adapting continually in response to new knowledge or
contexts.
●● The proximity trap: keeping the new business too close to the legacy
business, and thereby undermining its chances of survival.
●● The persistency trap: giving up too soon and underestimating the amount
of time needed to realize results.
Avoiding these traps requires long-term commitment to a vision, and to
continuous adaptation, and the right approaches to implementing and
embedding lasting change. Irresolute or lackluster executions do not work.
Bringing in new ways of working and implementing agile, for example, halfheartedly
simply leads to doing waterfall in an agile way, which will not
work. Underpinning these traps is the fundamental risk of how easy it is for
large organizations to succumb to what Russell Davies (former Director of
Strategy at the UK Government Digital Service) has called ‘principle drift’.
It’s always possible, he says, to make the internet fit the business model you
understand:
… the biggest challenge in Digital Transformation is not in the initial refocusing on
a new organizing principle, it’s in resisting the steady drift back to the old one…
Or, worse, to something that looks like the new one but is, in fact, the old one.22
Digital transformation is not a quick fix. Becoming an agile organization is
a fundamental, long-term shift, and so we need to be resolute in our determination,
stamina and in pursuing our vision.
260 The transformation journey
Minimum viable bureaucracy
Once we have established a growing momentum behind new ways of working,
one of the key ways to kill them is to allow a drift back to legacy
practices that are unnecessarily additive to bureaucracy and serve only to
slow things down. We need to be single-minded in maintaining the focus to
stay fast. One of the key battles to wage is against low value time-suck and,
in particular, meeting creep.
There are two types of meetings: those that result in action and those that
result in a loss of very valuable time. Paul Graham (Silicon Valley startup
incubator founder) has drawn a distinction between what he calls a ‘maker’s
schedule’ and a ‘manager’s schedule’. Makers (creative types, writers, programmers,
do-ers) prefer to use time in units of at least half a day since you can’t
complete a project or write or program well in anything less. Managers use
time in a different way, typically segmenting time into one-hour slots. Several
hours can be blocked off to complete a specific task, but the default is that
you change what you do every hour. For those on a manager’s schedule, a
meeting is simply a matter of finding an open slot and booking it in. But when
you’re operating on the maker’s schedule meetings can be a disaster, since
one meeting can blow the whole afternoon by breaking it up into chunks too
small to do anything truly productive with. The different types of schedule
can work in isolation but problems arise, says Paul, when they meet. And
since most bosses operate on the manager’s schedule ‘they’re in a position
to make everyone resonate at their frequency if they want to’.23 Protecting
blocks of time for key staff to make progress on initiatives is essential.
Yet meetings are a necessary part of corporate life. People need to get
together in order to give and receive updates, make decisions, move projects
on so when we do need to have them we should run them in the right way
and question the defaults we have. It is, after all, very easy for a growing
internally focused, meeting-driven culture to permeate. Noah Brier
(co-founder of innovative marketing technology platform Percolate, based
in New York) describes how the slow growth and normalization of this
behaviour can slow everything down:
In the case of meetings what starts as a one-off meeting to discuss something,
becomes a weekly meeting for 15 minutes, eventually with more people
involved, and eventually you have 15 people spending an hour together without
any real sense for what they’re talking about or why.
Add in a layer of creeping formalization, which manifests in the form of evermore
convoluted preprepared reports which eventually create a mountain
The transformation journey 261
of pre-meeting reading, and you have created a serious brake on agility and
actually getting things done. Noah’s company has introduced six rules for
meetings:24
●● Do you really need a meeting?
●● Meetings should be 15 minutes by default.
●● No spectators.
●● Have a purpose, state it upfront.
●● Make tasks, assign them to people.
●● Don’t bring computers or phones.
The questioning about whether you need a meeting at all should always
happen. Setting a time default that pushes teams to make decisions or to
update quickly resets the norms away from the one-hour blocks of time that
typically characterize the manager’s schedule (and meetings have a habit of
growing to fit the time allocated even if that is not needed). Clarity about
objectives and outputs seems obvious but can often slip. And screens distract
from the task at hand. Sensible, but important.
At LinkedIn they begin by defining the success criteria for the meeting,
apply the RAPID framework (making sure the key people are in the room –
the recommender (R), where necessary key people who agree with recommendation
(A), the performer who executes the decision (P), if appropriate
those with key input (I), and the decision-maker (D)), always begin with a
silent read through, rely on as few slides as possible, poll the room, and then
afterwards distribute and cascade actions, and follow up.25 These might
sound like obvious best practice, but meetings are often run in multiple,
unstructured ways in a business (dependent on who is chairing it) which,
when the majority of management time may well be spent in this way, can
lead to a significant drain on resources.
Amazon have a no PowerPoint rule for meetings. Says Jeff Bezos:
The traditional kind of corporate meeting starts with a presentation. Somebody
gets up in front of the room and presents with a PowerPoint presentation, some
type of slide show. In our view you get very little information, you get bullet
points. This is easy for the presenter, but difficult for the audience.26
Instead, a six-page narrative memo is created and attendees sit and read it
in silence at the beginning of the meeting. This forces greater clarity, better
presentation of data and reasoning, it removes unnecessary questioning, and
ensures better decisioning.
262 The transformation journey
It’s important to find your own rules and norms for maintaining time efficiency
but establishing better defaults and common expectations is a good
place to start.
The ultimate goal: achieving organizational ‘flow’
When we talk about being ‘in the zone’, we’re usually describing what
psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi has termed ‘flow’, the mental state
where we are completely immersed and absorbed, with deeply focused motivation,
on a singular task or activity.27 The concept has been applied to a
broad range of contexts including work, education, music, art, sports and
gaming.
If becoming a truly agile organization is about transitioning to a highly
manoeuvrable state of continuous adaptation and renewal, then we
might also say that it is about achieving a state of ‘organizational flow’.
Csíkszentmihályi has described how achieving flow in the workplace
requires clear goals that are combined with more immediate feedback and
the right balance between opportunity and capacity.28
The ultimate goal of the agile organization is to achieve a highly
productive state of organizational flow, the characteristics of which can be
described as:
●● Complete focus on achieving clearly defined goals, with no distraction.
●● Tight feedback loops that enable constant feedback and action.
●● Seamless adaptation to continually accommodate improved ways of
achieving objectives.
●● Exceptional manoeuvrability and fluidity in response to rapidly shifting
contexts.
●● Restless, constant innovation and experimentation in search of
opportunity.
●● Deeply ingrained learning culture.
●● An energizing, absorbing, invigorating environment in which to work.
●● Propelled by a self-perpetuating momentum that never slows.
●● The personification of a singular, bold, confident business.
Only when we have achieved a state of organizational flow, can we really
say that we have created a truly agile business.

Summary
Digital transformation affects different areas of society and the economy. It opens up
new networking possibilities and allows for cooperation between different actors, who
can then exchange data and thereby initiate new processes. In this book, the concept of
the digital transformation of business models is explained. Four examples of digital
transformation are presented. In addition, existing approaches to digital transformation
are shown and a five-phase Roadmap based upon these approaches is presented. The
phases are described with their objectives, activities, and tools. In the final section of
this book, selected examples are provided.
What you can find in our book:
– A compact, tried-and-true aid for the digital transformation of your business
model
– Foundations for the digital transformation of business models
– Selected examples of digital transformation
– A selection of existing approaches to digital transformation
– A Roadmap to the digital transformation of business models with activities,
tools, and examples.
Technological potentials, which allows for digitization and facilitates digitalization,
play an important role in the context of the digital transformation of business
models. Today, products are produced with mechanical and electronic components
and represent complex systems that allow for the linkage of hardware, software, and
data storage. This makes productsmore intelligent and interconnected than in the past
(Porter and Heppelmann 2014: 36). In addition to products, new business models
require but also allow for services, processes, and value chains to be digitized (Porter
and Heppelmann 2015).

One example of more intelligent products is Linde Material Handling, a manufacturer
of forklift trucks. Linde Material Handling equips its forklift trucks with
transmission units which send data such as operating hours or error codes via
Bluetooth or mobile network. This data allows spare parts to be ordered and repairs
to be performed without delay.
In addition to technological potentials and changing businessmodels, ever-changing
customer requirements also play a vital role. Nowadays customers often demand full
service packages instead of merely individual products.
The objective of this book is to explain the concept of the digital transformation of
business models. Furthermore, existing approaches to digital transformation are shown.
These approaches are then used to develop a Roadmap that includes five-phases: 1)
Digital Reality, 2) Digital Ambition, 3) Digital Potential, 4) Digital Fit, and 5) Digital
Implementation. The phases are described along with their objectives, activities, and
tools, while selected activities are further explained using detailed examples.
What is included in our book:
– Brief introduction to the foundations of digital transformation

History of Digital Transformation
Summary
In this section, the definition of digital and a brief history of digital transformation
will be presented. Additionally, we explore the difference between digitization and
digitalization. Finally, we will address the similarities and differences between
Business Process Reengineering and digital transformation and look at the future
of digital transformation.
2.1 What Is Digital?
Before examining the digital transformation of business models, it is important to
understand exactly what the “digital” in digital transformation means. There are
several definitions of “digital” (Berman 2012; Auriga 2016) but we utilize a
definition developed by McKinsey which states that digital is less about any one
process and more about how companies run their business (D€orner and Edelman
2015). McKinsey’s definition of “digital” can be broken down into three primary
foci:
• Creating value at the new frontiers of the business world
• Optimizing the processes that directly affect the customer experience
• Building foundational capabilities that support the entire overall business
initiative
In a Capgemini Consulting publication in cooperation with MIT Sloan Management,
Westerman et al. (2011) defined digital transformation “the use of technology
to radically improve the performance or reach of enterprises.” Although the definition
highlights the broad sense of the term, it fails to include the important
ingredients for achieving digital transformation. In any definition of digital transformation,
it is important to stress the requisite elements that lead to digital

transformation because without these ingredients true digital transformation is not
possible.
The implementation of technologies into business processes is only a small part
of digitally transforming a business. Technologies need to create additional value
for the customers, the business itself, and other essential stakeholders. “To succeed
in digital transformation, leading companies focus on two complementary activities:
reshaping customer value propositions and transforming their operations using
digital technologies for greater customer interaction and collaboration” (Berman
2012).
For the purposes of this book, we define digital transformation as a sustainable,
company-level transformation via revised or newly created business operations and
business models achieved through value-added digitization initiatives, ultimately
resulting in improved profitability.
2.2 Brief Historical Look at Digital Transformation
Although digital transformation is a popular point of discussion at the moment, the
ideas of digital products, services, and mediums were already well-understood in
the 1990s and 2000s (Auriga 2016). For example, in the retail industry, mass media
advertising campaigns were considered important digital channels to reach customers
in the 1990s and 2000s, even though purchases were still primarily made
inside brick-and-mortar stores, often with cash. From 2000 to 2015, the rise of
smart devices and social media platforms led to a drastic sea change in the methods
customers used to communicate with businesses, and also the expectations customers
had with regards to response times and multi-channel availability. Businesses
started to see that they were now able to digitally communicate with their
customers on an individual basis, and often in real time. An ever-growing selection
of digital payment options such as PayPal also contributed to more and more online
commerce and opportunities for web-based points of sale. Nowadays, there is a
focus on mobile devices and on creating value for customers by leveraging the
kinds of personalized customer data that mobile technologies can generate on a
massive scale. Businesses are taking advantage of this personalized information and
are able to better tailor their products, communications, and interactions to fit
customers’ specific needs.
2.3 Digitization vs Digitalization
In this book, the terms “digitization” and “digitalization” will both be used but they
are not interchangeable. There has been some recent discussion regarding the
definitions of digitization and digitalization (Brennan and Kreiss 2014). There is
considerable value in understanding the distinction between these terms before
4 2 History of Digital Transformation
diving into the digital transformation of business models. First, the importance of
differentiating digitization and digitalization will be discussed. Next, current definitions
for both terms will be shown and lastly, our definitions for digitization and
digitalization will be presented.
2.4 What Is Digitization?
There are several different definitions of “digitization” which differ depending on
the context. One of the most common associations with the term digitization is the
transformation from analog to digital. Researchers across different fields would
define digitization as the transformation of some type of analog or physical artifact
into a digital artifact. One (easy) example of this would be taking a photograph and
turning it into a digital photograph. One (more complex) example would be a
synthesizer. Synthesizers create sound through “continuous variables such as
changing voltages” rather than binary 1s and 0s (Pinch et al. 2009).
The first explanation can be considered a more transformation-oriented definition.
The next definition could be seen as process-oriented definition. Companies
should not simply turn analog things into digital artifacts just to follow the current
trends. Brennan and Kreiss (2014) argue that any material with two differentiated
states can store and communicate digitized signals. “This has motivated many
scholars to highlight the “immaterial” (e.g. Manoff 2006) quality of information
generated through digitization, while deemphasising the material systems (transistors)
on which that information is housed” (Brennan and Kreiss 2014). This
definition of digitization emphasizes the innovative process of mediation between
material (i.e. sensors) and immaterial (i.e. business processes).
Additionally, some industry experts have also offered additional definitions of
digitization. For example, Cisco has defined digitization as “the connection of
people, process[s], data and things to provide intelligence and actionable insights
enabling business outcomes” (Surber 2016). This definition points out the importance
of data and processes but also highlights the newly gained knowledge which
is a key difference between Business Process Reengineering (BPR) and digitization.
BPR will be discussed later. Another industry expert, Garnter, defines digitization
by saying, “the goal is to create and deliver new value to customers, not just
improve what is already being done or offered” (Moore 2015).
For the purposes of this book, we define digitization as digitally enabling analog
or physical artifacts for the purpose of implementing into said artifacts into business
processes with the ultimate aim of acquiring newly formed knowledge and creating
new value for the stakeholders.
2.4 What Is Digitization? 5
2.5 What Is Digitalization?
The first use of the term “digitalization” can be found in a 1971 essay published in
the North American Review (Brennan and Kreiss 2014). Robert Machal talked
about the “digitalization of society” with regards to the limitations and potential for
computer-aided research. A digital business consultancy, I-SCOOP (2016), offers a
concise definition of digitalization. “Digitalization means the use of digital technologies
and of data (digitized and natively digital) in order to create revenue,
improve business, replace/transform business processes (not simply digitizing
them) and create an environment for digital business, whereby digital information
is at the core.”
For the purposes of this book, we define digitalization as fundamental changes
made to business operations and business models based on newly acquired knowledge
gained via value-added digitization initiatives. In this book, we will focus on
the digitalization of business models and ultimately, the digital transformation of
these models.
2.6 Business Process Reengineering vs. Digital
Transformation
Some researchers and practitioners might see some similarities between Business
Process Reengineering (BPR) and digital transformation. In their oft-cited work,
Hammer and Champy (1993) provide a definition of BRP. The authors state that
BRP is the rethinking and reengineering of business-related processes to reduce
costs and improve products and services.
Although there are some similarities between BPR and digital transformation,
there are some distinct differences between the two approaches as well. According
to Proctor (2017), BPR’s focus is mainly on automating rule-based processes. Rulebased
processes are defined as clearly assigned rule-based processes which are
automated by technologies. Instead of focusing on the rule-based processes like in
BPR, the main objectives of digital transformation are obtaining new data and using
this data to reimagine these old, rule-based processes.
A more data-oriented approach allows for the opportunity to gain new knowledge
and in turn reimagine innovative business models and operations. For example,
Airbnb turned its attention from processes to data. Airbnb does not own its own
physical assets (e.g. hotels). Here is an example of how old, rule-based processes in
the hotel industry can be completely reimagined in a data-driven world. These
temporary apartment landlords and landladies who own properties in highly soughtafter
locations offer an alternative to hotels and provide an unique value for guests
(Bendor-Samuel 2017).
The big difference with digital transformation is how employees interpret the
newly acquired know-how and use it to improve decision-making capabilities. All
6 2 History of Digital Transformation
of the new data sources create newly formed knowledge sources based on that data.
Instead of only making processes more efficient or quicker, which is the aim of
automation, digital transformation requires individuals to rethink old processes and
reimagine new processes and decisions.
2.7 What Does the Future Hold for Digital
Transformation?
There is a general consensus among industry experts and professionals that digital
transformation needs to be an integrated and continuous part of any overall business
strategy. Many companies are creating new digital departments and hiring digital
specialists in several different divisions with the aim of driving their digital
transformation strategy. The International Data Corporation (IDC), global provider
of market intelligence, predicted that by 2018, the number of Internet of Things
(IoT) devices will double. In part because of this, mobile application development
should not be expected to slow down anytime soon. More importantly, IDC predicts
that digital transformation (DX) will reach a macroeconomic scale and impact.
“Over the next three to four years, DX efforts will no longer be “projects”,
“initiatives”, or “special business units” for most enterprises. In effect, every
(growing) enterprise—no matter its age or industry—will become a “digital native”
in the way its executives and employees think and how they operate” (Gens 2016).
Gartner also recognizes the impact of digital transformation now and in the
foreseeable future (Forni 2016). For example, Gartner states that by 2021, 20 percent
of individual daily engagement will involve at least one of the digital giants. At
the time of publishing, the top seven digital giants were Google, Apple, Amazon,
Baidu, Facebook, Alibaba, and Tencent.

Chapter 3
Digital Transformation of Business Models
Summary
This chapter introduces relevant definitions for elements pertaining to the digital
transformation of business models. These definitions are developed based upon
existing definitions from the field of digital transformation. The concept of a
business model is also explained. Lastly, the definition and development of the
digital transformation of business models is presented.
3.1 Digital Transformation
There is currently no single, commonly accepted definition for the term digital
transformation, although we have arrived at one for the purposes of this book.
Moreover, the terms digitization, digitalization and the digital age are often used
interchangeably (BDI and Roland Berger 2015: 4). Selected definitions referring to
digital transformation are shown in Table 3.1.
BMWi does not explicitly define their concept of digital transformation, but does
emphasize the importance of digitalization. Digitalization is considered to be a
networking of all areas of business and society. In addition, digitization is the
ability to collect relevant information, analyze it and translate into actions, which is
linked to the topics of big data and analytics (BMWi 2015: 3).
Bowersox et al. use the term digital business transformation and their definition
includes the process of redefining a business, digitizing processes, and expanding
relationships across multiple value-added chains. They see the challenge for management
to be leading companies and leveraging the full potential of information
technology along the entire value chain (Bowersox et al. 2005: 22). Several
dimensions of digital transformation are relevant.
Westerman et al. understand the role of technology in digital transformation to
be the enhancement of the performance or the reach of companies. The use of new

9
technologies serves to address the following dimensions: operational processes,
customer experiences, and business models (Westerman et al. 2011).
Mazzone (2014: 8) defines digital transformation as the conscious and ongoing
digital evolution of a company, a business model, an idea, a process, or a method,
which can be both strategic and tactical. This definition shows that digital transformation
can also relate to different dimensions.
PwC (2013: 9) defines the digital transformation as a transformation of the
corporate world through the establishment of new technologies based on the
internet that impact society as a whole. It is clear that the use of new technologies
is at the forefront of this definition.
Table 3.1 Selected definitions of the term “digital transformation”
Reference Definition
BMWi (2015: 3) Digitization stands for the complete networking of all sectors of the
economy and society, as well as the ability to collect relevant
information, and to analyze and translate this information into actions.
The changes bring advantages and opportunities, but they create
completely new challenges
Bowersox et al.
(2005: 22ff)
Digital Business Transformation is a “process of reinventing a business
to digitize operations and formulate extended supply chain relationships.
The DBT [Digital Business Transformation] leadership challenge
is about reenergizing businesses that may already be successful to
capture the full potential of information technology across the total
supply chain”
Westerman et al.
(2011: 5)
“Digital Transformation (DT)—the use of technology to radically
improve the performance or reach of enterprises—is becoming a hot
topic for companies across the globe. Executives in all industries are
using digital advances such as analytics, mobility, social media, and
smart embedded devices—and improving their use of traditional technologies
such as ERP—to change customer relationships, internal processes,
and value propositions”
Mazzone (2014: 8) “Digital Transformation is the deliberate and ongoing digital evolution
of a company, business model, idea process, or methodology, both
strategically and tactically”
PwC (2013: 9) Digital transformation describes the fundamental transformation of the
entire business world through the establishment of new technologies
based on the internet with a fundamental impact on society as a whole
Bouee´ and Schaible
(2015: 6)
We understand digital transformation as a consistent networking of all
sectors of the economy and adjustment of the players to the new
realities of the digital economy. Decisions in networked systems
include data exchange and analysis, calculation and evaluation of
options, as well as initiation of actions and introduction of
consequences
10 3 Digital Transformation of Business Models
Boue´e and Schaible (2015: 6) understand this trend as the networking of all
economic sectors and the adaptation of the actors to new realities of the digital
economy. To do so involves decisions about networked systems, which includes
data exchange and data analysis, the calculation and evaluation of options, as well
as the initiation of actions and the introduction of consequences.
Digital Transformation
The digital transformation framework includes the networking of actors,
such as businesses and customers, across all value-added chain segments
(BMWi 2015: 3; Bowersox et al. 2005: 22; Bouee´ and Schaible 2015: 6),
and the application of new technologies (PwC 2013: 9; Westerman et al.
2011: 5). As such, digital transformation requires skills that involve the
extraction and exchange of data as well as the analysis and conversion of
that data into actionable information. This information should be used to
calculate and evaluate options, in order to enable decisions and/or initiate
activities (BMWi 2015: 3; Bouee´ and Schaible 2015: 6) which increase the
performance and reach of a company (Westerman et al. 2011: 5). Digital
transformation involves companies, business models, processes, relationships,
products, etc. (Bowersox et al. 2005: 22; Mazzone 2014: 8).
3.2 Business Model
To fully address this trend, it is important to first define the term, “business model.”
Definition 1: Business Model (Schallmo 2013: 22)
A business model is the basic, underlying logic of a company which
describes what benefits are provided to customers and partners. A business
model answers the question of how the benefits provided by the company also
flow back into the company in the form of revenue. The value created enables
a differentiation from competitors, the consolidation of customer relationships,
and the formation of competitive advantage. A business model
involves the following dimensions and elements:
– The customer dimension contains the customer segments, customer channels,
and customer relationships.
– The benefit dimension includes products, services, and values.
– The value-added dimension includes the resources, skills, and processes.
(continued)
3.2 Business Model 11
– The partner dimension includes partners, partner channels, and partner
relations.
– The financial dimension includes revenues and expenses.
The objective is to combine the business model elements in such a way
that they mutually reinforce each other. Thus, it is possible to achieve growth
in a way that is difficult for competitors to imitate.
3.3 Digital Transformation of Business Models
Based on the aforementioned statements and the definition of Business Model
Innovation (Schallmo 2013: 29), we define the digital transformation of business
models as follows:
Definition 2: Digital Transformation of Business Models
The digital transformation of business models relates to individual business
model elements, the entire business model, value-added chains, as well
as the networking of different actors in a value-added network.
The degree of the digital transformation relates to the incremental (marginal)
as well as the radical (fundamental) change of a business model. The
reference unit with regards to the level of novelty is primarily the customer,
but it can also affect its own business, partners, industry, and competitors.
Within the digital transformation of business models, enabler(s) or technologies
(e.g., big data) are used to generate new applications or services
(e.g., on-demand predictions). These enablers require skills that make data
collection and exchange, as well as analysis, possible, which the enablers
must be able to use to calculate and evaluate options. The options are then
used to initiate new processes within the business model.
The digital transformation of business models is based on an approach
which includes a sequence of tasks and decisions that are related to one
another in a logical and temporal context. It affects four target dimensions:
time, finance, space, and quality.
Figure 3.1 presents digital transformation of business models definitions and
components.

Selected Examples Demonstrating the Digital
Transformation of Business Models
Summary
This chapter presents four case studies, each of which exemplifies the successful
digital transformation of a business model. Each example showcases the initial
starting point, problem definition, the objectives, a solution approach, the results
and application to the first phase of the model.
Initial Situation and Problem Definition
In this section, the selected company’s current situation and problems will be
outlined. These are important points to discuss not only to get a better understanding
of why a company chose a particular approach to the digital transformation
of their business model but also to understand potential alternatives.
Objective and Solution Approach
In this section, the objective of the company’s digital transformation of their
business model and their solution approach will be outlined.
Results and Application to Model
The Venn diagram below portrays the key factors one should consider when
initially taking the first steps towards the digital transformation of a business
model. The initial step requires a thorough evaluation of the business model
in search of opportunities for digital transformation. The next step is called
Digital Reality, which is the beginning of our Roadmap to the digital transformation
of business models. This will be further discussed in the final
section, Application to Model.
Figure 4.1 presents the Venn diagram serves as a preface to our Roadmap.
First Circle: Data to Be Utilized
The first circle, “Data which could be utilized,” depicts the broad world of information
which could potentially be quantified, digitized, analyzed, shared, etc. but is
© The Author(s) 2018

Business, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-72844-5_4
15
currently lying fallow. With the broad array of sensors and transmitters currently
available and the omnipresence of cheap, ubiquitous computing, this circle is ever
expanding. Of course, not all theoretically harvestable data can or should be
collected. One could, for example, equip a coffee mug with a wireless modem
and a barometer and begin collecting and transmitting air pressure and altitude data,
but unless the end user or the manufacturer have an interesting value-added idea for
what to do with that information, this new, java-filled member of the Internet of
Things would simply be an overpriced mug with superfluous functionality, not the
expression of a beneficial, digital business model transformation.
Second Circle: Added Value and Alleviation of a Pain Point
That is why the second circle, “Added value/alleviation of a pain point,” is so
important. From the broad universe of potentially quantifiable data, unutilized
information must be identified which has the potential to solve a problem or create
additional value for customers, suppliers, subsidiaries, or departments within the
company which is seeking to digitally transform its business model. It should be
noticed that most of circle two does not overlap with circle one. That is because
there are many ways to create value or solve problems which have little or nothing
to do with processing hitherto unutilized data. Extending the length of a warrantee
or paying invoices faster might be excellent examples of the successful “analog”
transformation of a business model, and while these “analog” transformations too
may be essential, they simply do not fall under the purview of this book.
Fig. 4.1 Venn diagram as a preface to our Roadmap
16 4 Selected Examples Demonstrating the Digital Transformation of Business Models
Third Circle: Profitability
The core function of any business is to generate returns on investments and to those
ends the third circle (and criterion) when evaluating a business model for digital
transformation potential is profitability. One could imagine many changes to
services, products, or processes which might make good use of unutilized data &
add value for customers, employees, or partners, but which fail the third and final
test-sustained, long-term profitability. A furniture store could, for example, create
an online portal which collects and presents competitors’ products and prices in
addition to its own, so that customers can compare and shop for furniture more
quickly and easily. This would obviously fit inside the overlap of circles one and
two in our Venn diagram. Previously neglected data is being utilized in a way that
alleviates a pain point for an external stakeholder, namely the customer. So far so
good. But if the end result of this online furniture comparison portal is that
customers are driven to a competitor’s discount warehouse who is able to offer
lower prices because they save money on overhead by not offering things like free
comparison portals to their customers, then the customer-centric furniture store has
undermined its business model rather than digitally transformed it.
Non-profit or academic institutions may not technically be seeking a profit, but
they do typically work within the context of limited resources and are hence
obligated to their stakeholders to use their budgets as efficiently as possible in the
service of their institution’s stated mission. Non-profit-oriented organizations can
view the third circle of the diagram as “ROI maximization,” or stated colloquially,
“The most bang for the buck.”
In any case, the overlap of these three criteria—potentially utilizable data (circle
one), utility for stakeholders (circle two), and profitability (circle three), creates a
narrowed target zone in which to hunt for digital transformation potential during the
initial brainstorming process.
Application to Model
The Venn diagram depicted above serves as a preface for the Roadmap for the
digital transformation of business models, which is outlined in greater detail in
Chap. 6 of this book. The Roadmap for the digital transformation of business
models is broken down into five phases, and the first of these phases is Digital
Reality. Using Digital Reality as our guide, the following dimensions will be
applied to each of the four case studies in this chapter:
– Customer dimension
– Benefit dimension
– Value-added dimension
– Partner dimension
– Financial dimension
The purpose is to show different examples of how current business models can
be evaluated. Later in Chap. 6, the entire Roadmap for the digital transformation of
business models, complete with activities and tools, will be enumerated and applied
to a single industry in an additional case study.
4 Selected Examples Demonstrating the Digital Transformation of Business Models 17
4.1 Hagleitner senseManagement
Hagleitner is an Austrian manufacturer of sanitary products and sanitary product
dispensers. In addition to liquid cleaning and disinfecting agents, they also manufacture
paper towel dispensers and dispensers for liquid soap solutions. Hygiene
training courses are also offered to their customers.
Most of Hagleitner’s customers are in the healthcare, catering, and food industries,
as one might expect given the demanding hygiene standards required by law
in these industries (Hagleitner 2016a).
Selected Hagleitner products are shown in Fig. 4.2.
Initial Situation and Problem Definition
Hagleitner helps customers meet hygiene requirements by selling and delivering
dispensers, especially touchless dispensers, and related supplies. The supplies (e.g.,
liquid soap and paper towels) are designed to allow easy and quick refilling.
The increasing hygiene requirements from customers, a lack of transparency as
to which and when a dispenser must be refilled, unsuitable human resource planning
that caused high personnel costs, burdensome supply inventory planning, and
excessive inventories led Hagleitner to develop a new system: Hagleitner
senseManagement (Hagleitner 2016b).
Objective and Solution Approach
The objective of Hagleitner’s senseManagement is providing a benefit to customers
by monitoring dispensers’ supply levels with sensors. This achieves cost and time
savings when refilling the dispensers. Additionally, customer and user satisfaction
has risen due to the increased availability of necessary hygiene items.
The system consists of dispensers (e.g., soap dispensers, disinfectant dispensers,
paper towel dispensers, and air fresheners) with integrated sensors that measure the
current fill level and send the data to a base station. This base station sends the data
to a Hagleitner server that provides this data to customers (e.g., cleaning staff) via
internet-enabled devices.
The benefit for customers is the increased transparency regarding consumption
and costs, which allows for more precise and accurate material and personnel
planning calculations. The benefit for Hagleitner is that their own production
planning and inventory levels can also be optimized, which has resulted in significant
cost reductions (Hagleitner 2016b).
The Hagleitner senseManagement concept is shown in Fig. 4.3.
Results
Hagleitner’s decision to create the senseManagement system is an example of
digitalization and developing and utilizing dispenser sensor data is an example of
digitalization. Their senseManagement system’s data collection aims to increase
transparency between Hagleitner and their customers, improve inventory planning,
and increase customer and end user satisfaction. Some of these issues could have
been addressed in other ways, such as by digitizing other product lines. From the
universe of theoretically useful data, other data streams could have been leveraged.
18 4 Selected Examples Demonstrating the Digital Transformation of Business Models
Fig. 4.2 Selected Hagleitner products (Source: Hagleitner 2016a)
4.1 Hagleitner senseManagement 19
For example, Hagleitner could have considered implementing toilet paper dispenser
sensors which indicate the current number of rolls of toilet paper remaining and
when the toilet paper dispenser needs to be refilled.
New standards and/or customer requirements often result in the changing of
pricing strategies by the manufacturer, new prices which are not always immediately
transparent to the customer. A dearth of real-time stock keeping data and
usage patterns had resulted in a lack of transparency and ineffective inventory
planning. The implementation of the senseManagement system addressed these
problems and provided added value to the customer and to Hagleitner.
The toilet paper dispenser sensor could also have addressed these issues and
provided some additional value to the senseManagement system. When considering
the different areas of a restroom, some parts, such as stalls, are not always
accessible. The location of soap dispensers allows facility managers constant access
but that’s not true of stalls.
From the customer’s perspective, the soap dispenser or toilet paper dispenser
sensor would both increase profitability by providing more transparency with
regards to costs, allowing for more accurate inventory planning and more efficient
personnel planning.
Due to limited access to the toilet stalls, the customers’ employees would know
immediately when toilet paper needed to be refilled, reducing pointless trips to the
restrooms and ensuring a comfortable experience for end users.
The added value for the customer of the soap dispenser sensor or the toilet paper
dispenser sensor could be considered and compared ad nauseum but the final and
Fig. 4.3 Hagleitner’s senseManagement system (Source: Hagleitner 2016a)
20 4 Selected Examples Demonstrating the Digital Transformation of Business Models
decisive test is the potential profitability of each digitalization pathway. While a
toilet paper dispenser sensor may have offered more overall value to the customer
than a soap dispenser sensor, more practical, profit-oriented considerations may
have prevailed. One reason why Hagleitner might have decided on the soap
dispenser over the toilet paper dispenser is that it required less engineering problem
solving and in turn a quicker development process and roll-out. The decision to
include either the soap dispenser sensors or the toilet paper dispenser sensors
depended on the perceived value by the customer but also on whether this value
could be translated into higher profits for Hagleitner.
Application to Model
Hagleitner’s road to the digital transformation of their business model involved
several critical self-evaluations of their current situation, potential alternatives, as
well as an initial look at their proposed solution. This all-important period of
reflection corresponds to the first phase of the Roadmap to the digital transformation
of business models; discovering their Digital Reality.
Hagleitner’s customer dimension
Hagleitner looked at the current requirements of their customers and noticed a
discrepancy between their own expectations and those of their customers. These
mismatched expectations also affected the customer channels.
The strength and trust of communication between Hagleitner and their customers
was tested by their different expectations. Hagleitner recognized that their
expectations need to be better aligned but also Hagleitner also needed to provide
better transparency.
Hagleitner’s benefit dimension
Hagleitner saw the new customer requirements were important to their customers
and developed their senseManagement system to meet these requirements.
(e.g. increased transparency). The toilet paper dispenser would also have delivered
this benefit but it might have come down to which solution created would have
strengthen the customer relationship more and generated more enthusiasm.
Hagleitner’s value-added dimension
Hagleitner recognized that they possess the internal know-how to develop a
senseManagement system and the underlying components like soap dispensers.
Hagleitner would most certainly also have had the resources and capabilities to
develop a toilet paper dispenser. For Hagleitner, when considering the soap dispenser
or toilet paper dispenser for their senseManagement system, the deciding
factor might have been the industry’s current value-added chain and how
Hagleitner would want to be positioned on this chain.
Hagleitner’s partner dimension
Based on insights from the customer dimension, Hagleitner discovered that their
customers were more price-sensitive and more concerned with personnel scheduling
than Hagleitner had previously thought. Based on these two realizations,
Hagleitner saw an opportunity to improve their partner relations with promises of
better transparency and introducing a partner channel which created more efficient
personnel scheduling with their senseManagement system.
4.1 Hagleitner senseManagement 21
Hagleitner’s financial dimension
As previously mentioned in the value-added dimension, when Hagleitner was
considering whether to develop a soap dispenser or a toilet paper dispenser the final
decision would have been heavily influenced by how much a customer would be
willing to pay for this benefit and how much would it cost to develop said benefit.
Put simply, profitability was a critical factor is the digital transformation of
Hagleitner’s business model.
4.2 ThyssenKrupp Elevator MAX
ThyssenKrupp is a German industrial group with different divisions. The Elevator
Technology division produces passenger and freight elevators as well as escalators
for office buildings, residential buildings, hotels, airports, shopping centers, and
other facilities. In addition to the sale and installation of elevators and escalators,
maintenance, repair, and modernization services are also offered (ThyssenKrupp
2016a).
Initial Situation and Problem Definition
ThyssenKrupp’s current business model mainly focused on the manufacturing of
elevators, installing them, and carrying out maintenance when needed. An increasing
number of tall buildings in major cities led to an increased demand for highperformance
elevators. Furthermore, customers and users demanded superior elevator
reliability. In addition, several already-installed elevators posed a risk to users due to
maintenance backlogs (ThyssenKrupp 2016b; Wetzel 2016).
Additionally, ThyssenKrupp’s competitors also offered elevator maintenance
services, services which are high margin compared to pure product sales (Dispan
2006: 22; Odermatt and Kressbach 2011).
Objective and Solution Approach
The objective of ThyssenKrupp’s elevator business was to reduce the outage
duration of their elevators by identifying causes of potential failure in a timely
manner. This would ultimately allow for faster maintenance and repair times. To
address this concern, they created the MAX, Elevator Monitoring System.
A timely identification of potential causes of outages requires a real-time flow of
information which provides key insights into the elevator’s current status. To
accomplish this, they outfitted ThyssenKrupp’s elevator components, such as
drive motors, elevator doors, and elevator shafts, with sensors. These sensors
collect information such as the cabin speed and motor temperature. The information
obtained is then evaluated with the help of predictive analytics and provided to
employees, who are responsible for maintenance and technology. These employees
now receive warning alerts as well as maintenance guidance and recommendations.
These changes allowed ThyssenKrupp to carry out maintenance work proactively,
thus reducing elevator downtime. In addition, costs, resources, and maintenance
planning were improved (CGI 2016).
22 4 Selected Examples Demonstrating the Digital Transformation of Business Models
Figure 4.4 shows ThyssenKrupp’s MAX concept.
Results
ThyssenKrupp’s MAX Elevator Monitoring System is an example of a
maintenance-oriented digitization initiative. MAX collects relevant technical and
mechanical information through sensors to reduce maintenance backlogs and
improve ThyssenKrupp’s overall maintenance services. Put simply, information
that was being ignored before is now being collected and utilized to provide value
to customers and create profit for ThyssenKrupp—a textbook example of the digital
transformation of a business model.
One could also imagine other opportunities for digital transformation which
ThyssenKrupp could avail themselves of. For example, an interactive screen/
billboard could be implemented into select models of elevators. These touch
screens could add value to a wide swath of stakeholders. The interactive elevator
billboard could be used by ThyssenKrupp to collect customer satisfaction feedback
or the interactive elevator billboard space could be leased or sold outright to end
users or third-party advertising agencies. End users could use the interactive
elevator billboard space to increase company awareness or collect employee feedback
on certain company events, while third party advertisers could use the screen
to serve highly-targeted ads to a captive audience.
ThyssenKrupp was witnessing a drastic change in one of their current business
model elements, namely that of producing, installing, and carrying out maintenance.
Similar to Hagleitner, the customer maintenance requirements were changing
and ThyssenKrupp needed to come up with a solution. The sole purpose of the
MAX is to gather and take advantage of data and utilize modern predictive analytics
to better evaluate and predict maintenance issues.
The proposed interactive elevator billboard space would have addressed another
opportunity to add value; workplace communication and a chance to introduce a
new media channel and marketing platform into an otherwise barren environment.
Effective maintenance services are an obvious priority add-on for a major elevator
manufacturer like ThyssenKrupp but an in-elevator touch screen digitization initiative
could also have been valuable. The idle-time spent riding the elevator could
be seen as a golden opportunity to broadcast information to or collect information
from elevator riders. ThyssenKrupp’s Max system increased profitability by offering
a premium maintenance add-on service which promises to decrease maintenance
backlogs.
Fig. 4.4 ThyssenKrupp’s MAX concept (Source: ThyssenKrupp 2016b)
4.2 ThyssenKrupp Elevator MAX 23
The proposed interactive elevator billboard space could have provided an additional
revenue stream via one-time sales or third-party leasing agreements. Alternatively,
advertising revenue from the screens could be used to subsidize the initial
list price of the elevator for builders and contractors, allowing ThyssenKrupp to
position its products at more competitive price points while maintaining healthy
margins vis-a-vis their competitors.
ThyssenKrupp’s final decision to implement the MAX system could have
stemmed from the realization that their in-house maintenance know-how was not
being fully utilized. The increase of revenue through new advertisement space
could still be an attractive proposal if ThyssenKrupp believes that such communication
expertise exists in the company and can be further leveraged to create
additional revenue streams for the company. Comparing the two examples,
ThyssenKrupp’s MAX maintenance system could be seen as a more pressing
need, given their core competencies.
Application to Model
ThyssenKrupp digitally transformed their business model by developing an innovative
maintenance management system. ThyssenKrupp’sMAX system delivered a
data-driven maintenance system which created new benefits for their customers and
in turned generated a new revenue stream. The following sections will apply our
Digital Reality analysis to ThyssenKrupp’s MAX system and compare it to the
theoretical, potential alternatives which they could have pursued but did not.
ThyssenKrupp’s customer dimension
Similar to the previous case study, ThyssenKrupp’s maintenance-oriented customer
dimension in their business model was digitally transformed by their MAX
system. ThyssenKrupp’s customer requirements were becoming more demanding
and with their MAX system, customers were willing to pay more for the increased
valued to the customer segment element. The MAX system provided clear communication
with regards to maintenance repairs and improved their customer
relations.
The MAX system introduced an innovative data-driven digital initiative that
spoke directly their customer’s and ThyssenKrupp’s maintenance department.
Although the MAX system included additional costs for their customers, the
improved long-term relationship and trust between the partners outweighed the
costs.
The interactive elevator billboard space takes advantage of underutilized space
in the elevators and create a new customer channel. This form of advertisement
could create a unique customer relation platform and reaches customers who would
be unexpectedly shown commercials and could provide invaluable insights through
interactive advertising campaigns.
ThyssenKrupp’s benefit dimension
The enhanced transparency with regards to the maintenance requirements provided
excellent benefits for all stakeholders. ThyssenKrupp recognized it was
essential to create a new digital-driven process but the real benefit for both
ThyssenKrupp and their customers was the access to data allowing for real-time
maintenance alerts.
24 4 Selected Examples Demonstrating the Digital Transformation of Business Models
High excitement could be generated when elevator riders are presented with an
opportunity to provide personal feedback. The touchscreen itself is a relatively
uncomplicated technology and its development and installation should easily
deliver the benefit of revenue generating advertising or gathering personal
feedback.
ThyssenKrupp’s value-creation dimension
The data and capabilities (i.e. resources) for such real-time maintenance alerts was
available but there was not any process within ThyssenKrupp’s business model that
specifically took advantage of such resources. Once ThyssenKrupp realized the importance
and value of such an innovative maintenance system, it is clear that the development
of theMAX system would be able to fulfill this value proposition. The gathered
data and simultaneous deliver to both the internal and external stakeholders created
tremendous value.
ThyssenKrupp would probably possess the internal capabilities to develop their
own interactive elevator billboard space but the development of actual content
could also be handed by other external stakeholders. Once the actual space is
created, the process of creating content could be handed off to marketing
departments.
ThyssenKrupp’s partner dimension
ThyssenKrupp’s partners are an important part of the business model and to
better integrate the partners in their business model, the value of ThyssenKrupp’s
maintenance services needed to be communicated. In the industry’s value-added
chain, the communication of maintenance repairs needs to be clearly communicated
to the partners and the MAX system was able to deliver which in turn improved the
relations between ThyssenKrupp and their partners.
The partners’ involved in the development of an interactive elevator billboard
space would depend on who delivers the actual content. Again, ThyssenKrupp
could use this space to obtain feedback about the overall elevator experience but
third-party companies could use the space to communicate to their own
demographics.
ThyssenKrupp’s financial dimension
The consideration of either developing a data-driven maintenance system like
the MAX system or an interactive screen/billboard ultimately depends on the
potential revenue and expenses. The revenue stream created by the MAX system
could potentially have a better long-term effect with regards to revenue. The
importance of an innovative maintenance system might outweigh the potential
additional revenue stream of an interactive screen/billboard. The one argument
for an interactive screen/billboard could have been the expenses. The MAX system
would involve considerable financial investment but an interactive screen/billboard
would have involved a smaller investment.
The financial dimension would be affected by an interactive elevator billboard
space by providing an additional revenue either to ThyssenKrupp or their partners.
For example, ThyssenKrupp could require a rental fee for the space or simply
include a surcharge in the purchase of one of their elevators. Another example
involving their partners could be pay per click revenue mechanism similar to
Google.
4.2 ThyssenKrupp Elevator MAX 25
4.3 Dynasens in Outpatient Care
Dynasens is a research project which investigates technical solutions to reduce
physical and mental stress among outpatient nurses. To these ends, they use
dynamic, sensor-based personnel and personnel deployment and tour planning in
nursing. It was a research project investigating technical solutions to reduce physical
and mental stress among outpatient nurses (Dynasens 2016).
Initial Situation and Problem Definition
One challenging aspect of outpatient care is that nurses are increasingly suffering
from the symptoms of physical and mental stress. Repetitive stress injuries arise
due to high physical demands and mostly manifest themselves in the limitation of
the body’s functions due to the damage and impairment of the skeleton, the joints,
and the muscles. Mental symptoms include lower job satisfaction and chronic
fatigue. Nurses face stresses from hard deadlines and a lack of creative possibilities/
freedom.
Objective and Solution Approach
The objective of the project was to provide outpatient nursing staff physical relief
through adjustments in individual ergonomic postures. For example, documentation
requirements can be reduced in order to alleviate time pressures. Additionally,
their documentation responsibilities can be improved so that it allows nurses to
maneuver more easily while performing their duties.
The approach which they developed was divided into three areas: a shirt sensor
to detect movements and postures, automated documentation, and dynamic personnel
deployment and tour planning.
The sensor shirt detects movements and postures that can help promote physical
relief. Integrated sensors were developed that are sewn directly into the work attire.
This captures a nurse’s posture and movements to create a body stress profile. This
body stress profile then allows for the identification of improper postures that create
stresses and can be used to develop stress reduction training programs. Ultimately,
improvements in this area can lower illness- or stress-related absences. Moreover,
the body stress profile can provide ideas to improve work functions and procedures
to achieve positive transformation.
Some automated documentation of care services is possible by utilizing sensor
data. For example, it is possible to determine nursing care activities through data
derived from the movement patterns which is then matched with the specified care
services. The collected data can be read directly from mobile devices and released
by the nursing staff to transfer the data into the care services maintenance software.
Therefore, the services provided can be captured completely and in a timesaving
manner.
Additionally, dynamic personnel deployment and tour planning was done via
software that can accommodate short-term and unplanned events (e.g., personnel
shortages or patient delays). Moreover, a combination of employee stress and
qualification profiles can be compared and matched to patient requirement profiles.
26 4 Selected Examples Demonstrating the Digital Transformation of Business Models
This would ensure that those in need of care are accommodated by the appropriate
caregivers (Dynasens 2016).
Dynasens’ shirt sensor is shown in Fig. 4.5.
Results
Dynasens’ digitization initiative focused on improving the workplace environment
for their nurses. Dynasens used dynamic sensors which embedded into the nurses’
clothing and were worn as the nurses went about their work day. The sensors
captured motion, position, and orientation data. Once the data had been collected,
it was analyzed with the goal of improving ergonomics and workplace layout, and
reducing redundant or stressful motions, all of which it was hoped would ultimately
result in fewer illness- and injury-related absences and improve the quality of life
for the nurses.
Once again, we can contrast and compare the digitalization which Dynasens
actually conducted with digital transformations that Dynasens could have (and still
could) implement. While a focus on employee ergonomics is certainly understandable,
there are other ways to improve the functionality of hospitals and in ways that
more directly affect patient outcomes. A sophisticated software diagnostic system
like IBM’s Watson Health not only has the capability to store endless amount of
medical information but also to understand and use language, suggest and assess
diagnoses, analyze patient data, and ultimately help doctors make critical medical
decisions (Friedman 2014). By giving doctors and nurses access to such a powerful
Fig. 4.5 Dynasens’ shirt sensor (Source: Starringer 2016)
4.3 Dynasens in Outpatient Care 27
tool, doctors could diagnosis diseases earlier and more accurately, improving
patient outcomes, and both doctors and nurses could spend their time more
efficiently.
Healthcare industry experts and researchers can all agree that the physical and
mental stress of their health employees particularly the nurses is difficult to manage.
Dynasens’ digitization initiative included the collection of posture and movement
data and this information was analyzed and used to develop nurse body profiles.
The nurse profiles aim to create awareness about their overall health and the
decrease of absences.
A sophisticated diagnostic system like Watson could benefit not only nurses but
also doctors. While providing diagnostic support for nurses, Watson would also
allow for the more efficient use of physicians’ time which could reduce physical
and mental stress. While access to a supercomputer such as Watson might have
been out of many institutions’ fiscal reach in the past, in recent years these kinds of
resources have become increasingly ubiquitous to the point that they are feasible
not only for large corporations but also small and mid-cap companies and even
nonprofit institutions like Dynasens.
Both the study of worker ergonomics and the addition of a powerful AI tool such
as IBM’s Watson would add value for Dynasens’ healthcare client. But in a world of
constrained resources, which avenue of digital transformation allows the non-profit
Dynasens initiative to achieve the greatest impact with its limited budget?
Employee absences affects productivity, team performance, and impacts hospital
budgets. If employees call in sick, this requires other employees to cover these tasks
and work longer hours. These overtime hours need to be paid by the employer,
increasing the total wages paid. The development of nurse body profiles aims to
reduce these absences.
A sophisticated diagnostic system could be profitable for healthcare clients by
increasing the time efficiency of doctors and nurses. The diagnostic system could be
sold to healthcare institutions with the promise of quicker diagnoses and potentially
quicker hospital releases.
Wearable sensors are a low-cost digitization initiative compared to the implementation
of a supercomputer and subsequent analysis of the resulting data.
Although supercomputers are become more accessible, the cost is still significantly
higher than the ergonomics research. Ultimately, the wearable sensors offer a low
risk, high reward digitization initiative which could have made it hard for Dynasens
to pass up.
Application to Model
The Dynasens project attempted to change healthcare-industry’s business model by
introducing reasonable priced dynamic sensors on their healthcare employees. The
digital transformation of the business model aimed at improving their nurses’
ergonomics and through these health awareness tools, nurses would gain a better
understanding of their workplace physical and mental stress preventing frequent
absence. Below, the first phase of the Roadmap will be applied and show exactly
how Dynasens approached their own transformation.
28 4 Selected Examples Demonstrating the Digital Transformation of Business Models
Dynasens’ customer dimension
In Dynasens’ situation, the healthcare employees’ (e.g. nurses) relations played
an essential role in Dynasens’ customer dimension. The danger of healthcare
employees increased physical and mental stress threatened the long-term relationship
between healthcare institutions and their employees. The implementation of
the dynamic sensors and improved health awareness was seen as a promising
digitization initiative. Through these dynamic sensors, the healthcare employees
received valuable communications about their personal health. The implementation
of a sophisticated diagnostic system would expand the customer segment by
including physicians and the patients.
Dynasens’ benefit dimension
The dynamic sensors offered a new benefit to the healthcare employees and this
was achieved by equipping the employees with a non-intrusive digitization initiative.
Additionally, the healthcare employees were offered the benefit without any
fear of making their data visible to other external stakeholders.
The requirements for all healthcare employees (i.e. nurses and physicians) and
patients are constantly changing and a sophisticated diagnostic system would be
flexible and able to adjust over time. Therefore, the benefit would be offered to
more stakeholders and the excitement of a sophisticated diagnostic system could be
felt not only by one stakeholder.
Dynasens’ value-creation dimension
Dynasens’ business model mirrors the healthcare institution’s model especially
with regards to the value-creation dimension. The healthcare employees are some
of the most critical internal resources and possess valuable skills that are hard to
replace. High healthcare employee absenteeism has a clear negative impact on the
healthcare industry’s value-added chain. The introduction of the dynamic sensors
provided an important process which aimed to further nurture the relationship
between all parties.
A sophisticated diagnostic system possesses capabilities that no human can
match. This resource creates value for all of the stakeholders and its integration
into a business model provides a truly data-driven process. But ultimately, the
nurses and physicians would be the ones who make the final diagnosis. Therefore,
without complete acceptance from all of the stakeholders, a diagnostic system
would not truly transform the value-creation dimension.
Dynasens’ partner dimension
Dynasens’ digital-driven project involved several partners but it is clear that the
healthcare employees were the most vital partners in this business model. The
dynamic sensors succeed in not creating more work for the healthcare employees
but still provided a new health-related channel and improved partner relations.
Although a diagnostic system provides the capabilities, the human element
would still play the most important role in the partner dimension. Therefore, the
system should only be implemented if its capabilities are properly communicated to
all affected stakeholders and these stakeholders support the implementation of such
a system.
4.3 Dynasens in Outpatient Care 29
Dynasens’ financial dimension
In this case study, it is more difficult to see the short-term gain in revenue or
decrease in expenses but a long-term effect on personnel expenses should be seen.
Themain objective of the dynamic sensors was to provide healthcare institutions with
information to help prevent illness-related absenteeism. Additionally, the costs of the
sensors were covered by several project partners, helping to reduce the initial costs.
The expense of a diagnostic system would be significantly higher than dynamic
sensors. The questionable long-term financial returns of diagnostic software might
outweigh the benefits of introducing such a system.
4.4 Wurzer Umwelt Limited
Wurzer Umwelt Limited is part of the Wurzer Group. It is a modern waste disposal
company and service company and operates in the fields of environmental protection,
the material and biological recycling of waste, and the recycling of valuable
waste. The services offered include green material recycling (composting),
biowaste recycling (biogas production), utilization of waste wood, recycling of
bulky waste and mixed waste, mineral processing, as well as the associated
container services.
Initial Situation and Problem Definition
A waste management company’s garbage pickup routes must be planned in great
detail. It is necessary to know exactly where the garbage cans are located and which
of them are to be emptied. If a garbage can be overlooked, a second vehicle must be
sent, which results in additional and unnecessary costs. The recording of such a
route plan is therefore very time-consuming and just as complicated to change.
Teaching new routes to employees or existing routes to new employees is therefore
also very time-consuming (TomTom Telematics 2017).
Overall, there are three problems that Wurzer Umwelt Limited wanted to solve:
• Enormous time spent preparing a detailed route plan
• Enormous time spent training new employees (about 7 months)
• High employee turnover rate in this industry
Objective and Solution Approach
The above-mentioned problems were to be solved by using the latest technologies,
which specifically meant:
• Time saving: Planning and processing of pickup routes should be more flexible
• Cost reduction: Training for new employees was to be streamlined and more
efficient
• Improved Resource efficiency: Employees should be deployed more flexibly,
decreasing the demand for standby services.
• Independence from employee turnover: Faster incorporation of new employees
30 4 Selected Examples Demonstrating the Digital Transformation of Business Models
• Potential for continuous improvement: Recording and visualization of the routes
should facilitate the recognition of more efficient routes
Wurzer Ltd turned to two partners for solution development: Hausner Logistik
Services and the IT service provider Logistikkonzepte Software Limited. Together,
they developed a branch-specific platform with which dispatchers could plan and
process daily routes faster. The basic functions are from WEBFLEET.
WEBFLEET is a fleet management platform from TomTom. In addition to
navigation and route planning, it offers an open interface, which allows vehicles’
position data to be seamlessly integrated into HLS’ own platform. Through the
combination of both platforms, complete street sequences can be tracked and
visualized (TomTom Telematics 2017). The special feature of the TomTom platform
is the point-to-point navigation, including detailed information about the next
stop, which helps the waste disposal worker to empty all required garbage cans
without forgetting one. The dispatcher can also track the route. The guided route
can be stored directly on the navigation device in the vehicle, so that employees not
familiar with the route can easily drive it (TomTom Telematics 2017).
By installing the navigation system in any vehicle with a mobile connection to
the specially developed platform, the following improvements have been made
(TomTom Telematics 2017).
• Shortening of the training period by 93%, from 7 months to 2 weeks
• Enormous increase in efficiency: Only four employees required to operate
300 routes
• Significant cost savings; approx. 90,000–100,000 euros per year.
Results
Wurzer’s branch specific WEBFLEET is an example of a multiple partner digitization
initiative joint venture and how these partners saw the value of reimagining
the use of existing technologies to address current problems. Together with three
external partners, Wurzer developed a waste fleet management system which
collected specific route information to help current and new employees with route
efficiency.
One alternative digital initiative for Wurzer could have been the implementation
of NFC sensors on the residents’ trash cans. These NFC sensors could have offered
more two-way communication Wurzer and their customers. One practical use of
these NFC sensors could be customers’ requests for additional trash pick-up or even
special requests like large bulk pick up.
Wurzer’s WEBFLEET was a joint venture between several external stakeholders.
Together with these external stakeholders, the overall aim of the
WEBFLEET system was to create more efficient waste management routes and
help with some fairly ubiquitous personnel issues (e.g. decrease new employee
training time and employee turnover). According to the results, not only did the
WEBFLEET address those issues but it also contributed to extreme cost savings,
which dramatically affected the financial dimension of Wurzer’s business model.
4.4 Wurzer Umwelt Limited 31
In several countries, designated recycling centers provide residents with the
opportunity to throw away large bulky items like furniture, beds, and applications.
The first difficulty for some residents is that these recycling centers are not in close
proximity. Another problem is that residents need sufficient loading equipment
like a trailer hitch and trailer to haul these bulky items. Moreover, these recycling
centers sometimes charge an additional waste removal fee for such bulky items.
Wurzer could have created a new communication channel with NFC sensors
which would digitally reinvent the partner dimension of their business model.
This communication channel could have allowed residents to communicate
directly with Wurzer and request special bulk waste pickup whenever the need
was there.
Wurzer saw immediate tangible results which directly affected their profitability.
The shortening of training times naturally led to a decrease in training costs.
The improved route efficiency (e.g. lower fuel consumption) also positively
influenced Wurzer’s profitability. Although it is sometimes difficult to see the
return on investment (ROI) with some digitization initiatives, Wurzer’s
WEBFLEET clearly delivered positive results.
The proposed NFC sensors on the residents’ trash cans could have also directly
affected the financial dimension of Wurzer’s business. The NFC sensors would
have affected the financial dimension of the business model not only by providing
additional revenue potential but the additional revenue could also have been
invested in other areas like personnel and route planning. Additionally, the development
of NFC sensors for the residents’ trash cans would be less expensive and
could potentially be done using Wurzer’s internal know-how. Finally, the new
communication channel could provide Wurzer with marketing research on what
possible new services could be offered. For example, based on the frequency of
major appliance pickups, Wurzer could offer more frequent pickup dates at an
additional charge.
Application to Model
The road to Wurzer’s digital transformation involved multiple partners who
assisted in developing the WEBFLEET system. Their system harvested already
accessible information and Wurzer increased their waste pickup route efficiency
and reimagined their employee training program, dramatically reducing training
times. Using the Digital Reality as a framework, Wurzer’s path to the digital
transformation of their business model will be outlined.
Wurzer’s customer dimension
Wurzer’s digital transformation of their business model focused on their current
fleet, waste management workers, and the value of employee training and route
efficiency. Wurzer recognized that forming long-term relationships with their
employees was difficult given their high rates of employee turnover. The easiest
way to solve their problems and reach their waste management workers was by
introducing the WEBFLEET system into their vehicles. Interestingly, Wurzer’s
WEBFLEET digitally changed their customer dimension not by direct
32 4 Selected Examples Demonstrating the Digital Transformation of Business Models
communication with their waste management workers but with one of Wurzer’s
non-current assets; its vehicles.
Alternatively, the implementation of NFC sensors would have provided direct
communication with another partner; the residents. Companies like Wurzer might
not look close enough at their residents but this could be a potential interesting
customer to add to this segment. Implementing a new customer channel with NFC
sensors could have created a new form of customer relations.
Wurzer’s benefit dimension
In this case Wurzer received the most obvious benefit. Wurzer’s fleet was
already on their books and Wurzer believed available vehicle data could be
processed by the new WEBFLEET system which would in turn assist in their
personnel and route planning.
It might be difficult to excite residents at the prospect of using NFC transmitters,
but it is hard not to see the clear benefit of improved communication with their
waste management services. The benefit of easily communicating with a waste
management company like Wurzer about additional services without the need to
call or look up Wurzer’s contact information could be of tremendous value.
Wurzer’s value-creation dimension
Wurzer recruited some important partners who possessed the resources and
capabilities to deliver the WEBFLEET system. The technology to develop such a
digital fleet management system already existed but the WEBFLEET system was
developed specifically for a waste management business model. Therefore, the
system was able to be seamlessly integrated into Wurzer’s business model.
Wurzer’s core competency is the removal and transport of waste, but ignoring
residents in their customer dimension was causing them to miss out on an opportunity
to fundamentally change the industry’s value-added chain.
Wurzer’s partner dimension
Wurzer may not have possessed the necessary internal know-how to develop
such a system alone, but was able to rely on key partners who in turn provided
unique capabilities and became fully integrated into the waste management
company’s value-added chain. The development of the partner relations was critical
to the successful digital transformation of Wurzer’s business model.
One of the clear advantages of NFC sensors is that this type of digital initiative
could be done with less partners or even by Wurzer alone. This could have reduced
any possible partner communication problems that might arise when dealing with
multiple partners like with the WEBFLEET system.
Wurzer’s financial dimension
Wurzer’s bottom line was improved with the reduction of employee training and
overall costs. It is unclear what the agreed upon cost structure was for the partners to
develop the WEBFLEET system but based on the initial reports, the financial
dimension was positively affected.

Existing Approaches
Summary
The following section introduces three existing approaches to digital transformation
that can serve as the basis for a Roadmap.
In the area of business model innovation, numerous approaches have already been
analyzed in the literature and consolidated as procedure models (Bucherer 2011:
63; Schallmo 2013: 47; Schallmo 2015: 5, 131; Wirtz and Thomas 2014: 37).
Innovation of a business model includes changes in individual business model
elements (e.g., customer elements, services, etc.) or changes to the entire business
model (Schallmo 2014: 13). The digital transformation of a business model aims to
utilize enablers within the business model, to raise digital potentials, and to create a
digital value-added network as well as digital customer experiences. In addition, the
digital transformation of business models is based on existing business models, and
changes existing business model elements or creates new ones.
The following section introduces three existing digital transformation
approaches that serve as the basis for a Roadmap to the digitalization of a business
model. Additional approaches are also included that can be used for the design and
modeling of new digital business models (Cole 2015; Hoffmeister 2017), or of a
mature, existing model (Azhari et al. 2014: 38). These approaches, which are not
specifically addressed in the Roadmap, can also be integrated into the Roadmap
when suitable. Meanwhile, our primary focus is on Roadmap development.
5.1 Esser’s Approach
Esser (2014) defines five phases that outline the development plan for a digital
transformation strategy and its implementation. The phases are shown in Fig. 5.1
and are described briefly below.
Figure 5.1 illustrates Esser’s approach.

Analysis
Analysis focuses on four areas: customers, competitors, markets, and business
capabilities. Customer needs and values are analyzed and segmented. Competitors
are described and measured by their current (market) performance and market
positioning. Newcomers to the market are also considered. The market is analyzed
according to its size, its potential, its limitations, and future developments. Finally,
available business capabilities are gathered.
Strategy
The second, strategy phase includes defining market position, deciding how the
business wants to differentiate itself, and selecting the customer target group.
Design
Design is based on three areas: a vision for the customer experience, value proposition,
and the identification of opportunities. The vision for the customer experience
includes a statement about what the business would like to achieve. The value
proposition answers the question of how and with what services one will excite
customers. Finally, the identification of opportunities assesses current and new
design ideas.
Organizational Impact
Organizational impact refers to the people, the structure, and the culture within the
business. In addition, processes and systems are examined, and finally governance
and control are defined.
Transformation
The transformation ultimately dictates the Roadmap and program management. In
addition, internal communication as well as change management are planned.
Lastly, branding and external communications are defined.
The defined phases are very general and therefore specific references to digital
transformation are infrequent. Nevertheless, Esser’s approach offers useful ideas
about which phases and what content should generally be taken into account.
5.2 PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Approach
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) defines six phases for digital transformation within
a framework (2013: 40). The phases are shown in Fig. 5.2 and specifically below
(PwC 2013: 40).

Figure 5.2 shows PwC’s approach.
Strategy
A strategy is developed within the framework of the first phase, and the effects of
digital dynamics should be understood here. The company’s current position is
determined and a new business model is designed. In addition, a safety assessment,
a value-creation analysis, as well as the legal and tax ramifications are considered.
Finally, corporate culture and human capital are analyzed.
Design
The second phase is the design of the transformation Roadmap. To these ends, the
collaboration model, the value-creation network, and the operating model are
defined. In addition, the target architecture, the transformation plan, and the target
model for corporate culture are determined. Lastly, the tax and legal aspects are
modeled.
Construction
The third phase is construction, which completes the development of a digital
business platform. To achieve this, governance is introduced and a platform or
application is developed. The operating model and business/IT services are adapted
based on this construction. Digital security and skill management are also defined.
Implementation
The implementation phase initiates the previously developed business platform.
Quality assurance and employee training are rolled out to ensure a successful
transition.
Operation
In this phase, new business models are considered while in operation as running
systems. Here, governance, the platform, and application management and
reporting play a vital role.
Review
The last phase is review, which includes performance monitoring and optimization.
For this purpose, service level adjustments are made and operational optimizations
as well as optimizations to the business model are carried out.
Together, these six phases account for several aspects of digital transformation,
all of which are described extensively in the PwC approach.

5.3 Boue´e and Schaible’s Approach
Boue´e and Schaible describe a digital transformation master plan that is specifically
designed to address a digital future (Boue´e and Schaible 2015: 34). The phases are
presented in Fig. 5.3.
In Fig. 5.3, Boue´e and Schaible’s approach is presented.
Analysis of the Influence of Digital Technology on the Industry
Within the framework of this phase, different distinct future scenarios are forecast
and potential changes in value chains are analyzed. In addition, technologies are
categorized and relevant market participants are evaluated. As a result, there are
frequently several changes identified in this phase.
Comparison with Current Position of the Company
The second phase involves an analysis of opportunities and risks for the existing
business. Furthermore, affected products, customers, and regions are analyzed. In
addition, digital capabilities such as human resources or partnerships are defined
and the digital business strategy is established. Resulting implementation and
competence gaps are identified.
Implementation of the Roadmap
In the final phase, relevant options for the future scenarios are defined. For example,
digital skills in need of further development are identified and cooperative market
participants are discussed.
These phases capture several aspects of digital transformation and include
detailed analyses.

Roadmap for the Digital Transformation
of Business Models
Summary
This Roadmap is based on the approaches to digital transformation presented here
as well as existing theories about business model innovation. The five Roadmap
phases are: (1) Digital Reality, (2) Digital Ambition, (3) Digital Potential, (4)
Digital Fit and (5) Digital Implementation.
A Roadmap is given here based on the presented approaches to digital transformation
and based on existing theories about business model innovation (Bucherer
2011: 63; Rusnjak 2014: 109; Schallmo 2013: 47; Schallmo 2014: 52; Schallmo
2015: 5; Wirtz and Thomas 2014: 37).
6.1 Overview of Roadmap for Digital Transformation
of Business Models
The Roadmap for the digital transformation of business models has five phases.
Digital Reality
In this phase, Digital Reality, the company’s existing business model is outlined,
along with a value-added analysis related to stakeholders and a survey of customer
requirements. This provides for an understanding of the Digital Reality for this
company along different parameters.
Digital Ambition
Based on the Digital Reality, objectives are defined for the digital transformation.
These objectives relate to time, finances, space, and quality. Digital Ambition
determines which objectives should be considered for the business model and its
elements. Objectives and business model dimensions are subsequently prioritized.

Digital Potential
During the Digital Potential phase, best practices and enablers for the digital
transformation are established. This serves as a starting point in terms of Digital
Potential and the design of a future digital business model. For this purpose,
different options emerge for each future business model element and these options
are then combined and connected in a logical manner.
Digital Fit
The Digital Fit phase looks at options for the design of the digital business model.
These options are evaluated to determine Digital Fit with the existing business
model. This ensures that customer requirements are met and that business objectives
are achieved. The evaluated options are then prioritized.
Digital Implementation
Digital Implementation includes the finalization and implementation of the new
digital business model. The various options are further pursued within a digital
implementation framework. The Digital Implementation also includes the design of
a digital customer experience and a digital value-creation network, which describe
the integration of the new business model with partners. The resources and capabilities
are also identified in this phase.
Figure 6.1 illustrates the Roadmap to the digital transformation of business
model with its various phases and activities. The phases are explained further
below, each with specific objectives and questions. Activities are shown, along
with each of their tools. Selected activities are illustrated by case studies.

42 6 Roadmap for the Digital Transformation of Business Models
General Electric with Pivotal (GE 2016a; Pivotal 2016)
GE has a total of nine divisions and sees itself as a leading digital industry
company. GE wants to link their core businesses through software-based
technologies and solutions that are fast, forward-looking, and progressive.
That is why GE invested $105 million in return for a 10% share in the
company Pivotal. Pivotal converts data into information that is used for
services. Intel and Cisco are also Pivotal partners and Pivotal has a total of
more than 100 technology partners and two system integrators: Capgemini
and Accenture.
Initial Situation and Problem Definition
GE has collected over 50 million records, gathered by over 10 million sensors
installed in machines, equipment, etc. So far, Pivotal has developed over
40 applications for GE, including flight route optimization and downtime
avoidance.
The GE Aviation division manufacturers engines and provides maintenance
for airlines, for example to the low-cost carrier Air Asia, which has a fleet of
160 planes and operates 340,000 flights per year. Air Asia’s flight network
consists of over 100 destinations in 22 different countries. There is an
example of GE engine in Fig. 6.2.
Analysis showed that across all carriers worldwide there was a savings potential
of 18–22% which was being wasted on excess fuel consumption caused by
protracted flight times and inefficient flight routes. If fuel consumption were
decreased even by 1% p.a., about $30 billion could be saved over the next
15 years.
Objective and Solution Approach
GE expanded their existing business model, the sale and maintenance of drivetrains,
by establishing GE Flight Efficiency Services. With the new department they
Fig. 6.2 Example of an GE engine (Source: GE 2016b)
6.1 Overview of Roadmap for Digital Transformation of Business Models 43
offered fuel management, navigation, flight data analysis, risk management, and
other services. The objective was to reduce operating costs and improve utilization
to achieve cost savings for airlines.
Results
GE Aviation division recognized the inefficiencies in the airline industry and
digitally transformed their business model with the creation of GE Flight Efficiency
Services. Partnered with an external stakeholder, one of the main services provided
by this new department is the collection of vital engine information for the
optimization of flights and reduction of downtime.
Meanwhile, other actors in the airline sector have been busy digitally
transforming completely different aspects of their industry. One of the most
uncomfortable experiences for airline passengers is turbulence. Boeing, in collaboration
with FedEx, will be using remote-sensing technology to detect clear-air
turbulence. The technology will use LIDAR, a light detection and ranging technology
which emits laser pulses from different areas of the plane. “It offers the
potential to accurately measure winds as much as 17.5 km (10.8 miles) in front of
airplanes and provide pilots with sufficient time to take appropriate action to avoid
wind shear and clear air turbulence, which often occurs at high altitude and does not
have any visual cues, such as clouds” (Draper 2017). Let’s compare these very
different digital transformations within the airline industry and the value they add
for stakeholders respectively.
One of GE Flight Efficiency Services’ primary objectives is improving fuel
efficiency. The data gathered by engine sensors provides the necessary information
to better plan flight routes and reduce flight times.
The detection and avoidance of turbulence on the other hand could lead to
increased passenger satisfaction. Turbulence cannot be totally eliminated but such
digitization initiatives can prevent longer spells of turbulence.
Both digitization initiatives should result in increased profitability for airlines.
GE Flight Efficiency Services allows better fuel planning schedules which can
decrease flight grounding and this shorter grounding time would increase revenue.
Additionally, maintenance planning can also benefit from such data and also lead to
decreased grounding time.
Increased passenger satisfaction as a result of consistently smoother flights could
help airlines leverage higher air fares or greater market share. Better turbulence
detection could also decrease fuel consumption.
GE Flight Efficiency Services is an ambitious attempt to improve the effectiveness
of flight planning. Decreasing the length of turbulence would be a welcome
improvement for every crew member and passenger but at the moment, such remote
sensor technology is still in its infancy. GE decided to take advantage of tried and
true technologies—like sensors on engines—but it does not exclude the possibility
of GE later including these new turbulence detection technologies as a part of their
Flight Efficiency Services.
44 6 Roadmap for the Digital Transformation of Business Models
6.2 Digital Reality: Current Status Evaluation
6.2.1 Objectives and Questions
The objective in this phase of the Roadmap is to evaluate the Digital Reality. To
these ends, the existing business model is sketched, and the value-creation chain,
actors within the industry, and customer requirements are identified.
The following questions are answered in the Digital Reality phase:
– How is the current business model structured? How distinct are the main
dimensions of the business model?
– How is the current value-creation chain structured/designed? What are the
value-creation segments?
– Which actors are involved in each stage? How are these actors linked to each
other? What are the customer segments? What are the current and future
requirements of the customer segments?
6.2.2 Activities and Tools
Within the activities, tools are utilized to achieve the desired results.
Outline of the Existing Business Model
Digital transformation refers to a change in the existing business model. For this
reason, it is crucial to develop a thorough understanding of the current business
model. A uniform description grid is utilized to describe the existing business
model based on 5 dimensions and 13 elements (Schallmo 2013: 119–139).
The business model dimensions are (Schallmo 2013: 118):
Customer Dimension
• Customer Segments
• Customer Relationships
• Customer Channels
Benefit Dimension
• Products and Services
• Values
Value-Creation Dimension
• Resources
• Skills
• Processes
6.2 Digital Reality: Current Status Evaluation 45
Partner Dimension
• Partners
• Partner Channels
• Partner Relations
Financial Dimension
• Revenues
• Expenses
Each of these business model dimensions is accompanied by several essential
questions which must be answered before a business model can be developed. The
answers to these questions will not only provide insight into the current business
model but will also be used to better understand the situation in your industry and
provide the first steps of a digital transformation, which is determining the potential
degrees of digitization.
The essential questions are formulated in such a way as to survey the current
business model. If the questions are to be applied to a future (not yet existent)
business model, the guiding questions would need to be revised accordingly.
Customer Dimension
Constructing a prototype helps us to identify and develop the customer dimension.
The customer dimension prototype should describe the following relevant
information: 1) customer segments, 2) customer channels, and 3) customer relations
(Bieger and Reinhold 2011; Osterwalder et al. 2005).
Within the customer dimension, the guiding questions for the customer segment
are the following:
• What are the current customer requirements and based on this, how is the
customer segment formed?
• What are the customer segments that should be first outlined?
• What benefits should be provided to the customer segment and how much are the
customers willing to pay?
• What is the value of the customer segment to the business and which customer
segments are the most important?
Within the customer dimension, the guiding questions for the customer channels
are the following:
• How are customers’ communication and sales channels integrated into business
operation processes (e.g. enquiries, procurements)?
• How many customers can be reached using these communication and sales
channels?
• How should the customer segment be reached using these communication and
sales channels?
Within the customer dimension, the guiding questions for the customer relations
are the following:
46 6 Roadmap for the Digital Transformation of Business Models
• How can new customers be acquired and build a long-term relationship with the
business?
• What are the costs of the various forms of customer relations?
• Which forms of customer relations are particularly promising?
• Which forms of customer relations should exist?
Benefit Dimension
Constructing a prototype helps us to identify and develop the benefit dimension.
The benefit dimension prototype should describe the following relevant information:
What benefits including services (within an incentive system) will be generated
(Bieger and Reinhold 2011; Johnson 2010; Osterwalder et al. 2005)? Are there
results available (e.g. potential service foci) and general forms for performances
and benefits?
Under the benefit dimension, the guiding questions for the products, services, and
benefits are the following (Bieger and Reinhold 2011: 37; CE VeMaB 2011; Johnson
2010: 28; Mullins and Komisar 2009: 66; Osterwalder and Pigneur 2010: 23;
Skarzynski and Gibson 2008: 113–118; Weiner et al. 2010: 57;Wirtz 2011: 140):
• What current and future requirements does a specific customer segment have and
how important are these requirements for the respective customer segment?
• What benefits should each of the customer segments be offered and how should
this benefit be formulated into a value proposition?
• Which products and services are essential to deliver this benefit and does it fulfill
the promise made by the value proposition?
• Which benefits should be offered to the internal and external stakeholders
involved?
• How will the customers become enthusiastic about the brand, its services, and
the benefits generated?
Value-Creation Dimension
Forming a value-creation dimension prototype with specified resources, capabilities,
and processes helps to identify and develop the value-creation dimension.
These elements of the value-creation dimension are necessary to develop the
services, to generate the benefits, and to operate the business model (Bieger and
Reinhold 2011: 32; Johnson 2010: 133; Osterwalder et al. 2005: 10). Results are
also made available (e.g. an industry’s value-added chain, technology industry map,
etc.) and new standards will be developed for resources, capabilities, and processes.
Within the value-create dimension, the guiding questions for the resources and
skills are the following (Schallmo 2013):
• Which resources and capabilities are essential for the benefit dimension?
• How are resources and capabilities formed and where can they be obtained?
• Which resources and capacities are critical for the success of the business
model?
• Which resources and capabilities are unique to the business?
• How should the internal and external stakeholders’ resources and capabilities be
integrated into the business model?
6.2 Digital Reality: Current Status Evaluation 47
The guiding questions for the processes are the following (Schallmo 2013):
• How is the industry’s entire value-added chain developed and what position
should be taken within this value-added chain?
• Which processes are essential for the fulfillment of the value proposition?
• Which processes are necessary for the delivery of channels and for nurturing
customer relationships?
• Which processes should the internal and external stakeholders carry out themselves
and how will this be linked with the partners?
Partner Dimension
The creation of a partner dimension prototype helps to identify and detail the
partner dimension. Partners would include any internal and external stakeholders.
The partner dimension prototype describes the following relevant information: 1)
description of the partners, 2) partner channels, and 3) partner relations
(Osterwalder et al. 2005, S. 10; Weiner et al. 2010). There are new standards for
the partners which draw from the partner channels and the partner relations.
Within the partner dimension, the guiding questions for the partners are the
following (Schallmo 2013):
• Which partners are essential to the business model?
• Which resources and capabilities should the partners provide?
• Which partners are integrated into the value-added chain and which processes
should the partners perform?
• Which customer channels could be developed through the partners?
• How should the partners be supported with the fulfillment of the value
proposition?
The guiding questions for the partners’ channels are the following (Schallmo
2013):
• Which communication and procurement channels should be used to reach the
partners?
• Which communication and procurement channels are especially promising and
cost effective?
The guiding questions for the partners relations are the following (Schallmo
2013):
• Which forms of partner relations are particularly promising?
• How cost sensitive are the various forms of partner relations?
• Which forms of relations should be developed with partners and how does this
collaboration take place?
Financial Dimension
Identifying the financial dimension aims to describe the last of the five business
model dimensions which has significant influence on digital transformation. The
48 6 Roadmap for the Digital Transformation of Business Models
financial dimension consists of the revenues and expenses (Johnson 2010;
Osterwalder et al. 2005) which arise within the aforementioned business model
dimensions and elements.
Within the financial dimension, the guiding questions for the revenues are the
following (Schallmo 2013):
• Which customers and how many of them are willing to pay for these benefits?
• How can the benefits contribute to the revenue stream?
• Which outputs (product and services) can generate revenue?
• How should the revenue mechanism (e.g. rental fee by the minute) be developed
for the customer segments?
The guiding questions for the expenses are the following (Schallmo 2013):
• What expenses will arise during the operation of the business model and within
the respective business model elements, and which expenses are essential?
• How much will the expenses relate to resources, capabilities, and processes cost?
• How will the cost structured be influenced by factors such as quantity, price,
etc.?
• How should the cost mechanism (e.g. royalties payments) be developed with the
partners?
Figure 6.3 illustrates the business model dimensions and elements. The relationships
between business model elements are also sketched (for a detailed description
of business model elements see Schallmo 2013: 117). The example refers to an
aircraft engine manufacturer.

for this industry are listed. Then the actors relevant to each stage of the valuecreation
chain are depicted, along with their business model (Hitt et al. 2012: 24;
Grant 2016: 123; Gadiesh and Gilbert 1998: 149; Schallmo 2013: 182). Next, the
degree of digitization in the value-creation chain is determined, based on uniform
criteria (e.g., the use of technologies, networking among various actors, etc.) and is
illustrated in a diagram. The degree of digitization and the resulting change in
business models varies depending on the industry (KPMG 2013: 9; Boue´e and
Schaible 2015: 27; Geissbauer et al. 2014: 3). Based on the analysis of the valuecreation
chain and the actors, it is possible at a glance to identify attractive valuecreation
chain stages and potential partners. Figure 6.4 shows the value-creation
chain stages, actors, and the respective degrees of digitization.
Collection of Customer Requirements
In order to collect customer requirements, a customer profile (or a user profile) is
created based on selected criteria (Plattner et al. 2009: 167; Curedale 2013: 224;
Gray et al. 2010: 65). A customer profile is commonly used in the business-toconsumer
(B2C) industries, but can also be used in the business-to-business (B2B)
industries to describe groups of people (e.g., purchasing or production managers or
sole proprietorships). Figure 6.5 shows the customer profile of an airline maintenance
specialist.
In particular, it is essential to collect the customer requirements based on the
following benefit categories (Schallmo 2013: 129 f.):
– Functional benefits: Derived from the use of the basic functions of the product
and/or service.
– Economic benefits: Derived from the direct/immediate performance of the
product and/or service.
– Process-related benefits: Derived from ease of procurement (e.g., time savings).

– Emotional benefits: Positive feelings experienced through the use of the product/
service (e.g., brand).
– Social benefits: Created through the social recognition one attains through the
use of the product/service.
6.3 Digital Ambition: Setting Objectives
6.3.1 Objectives and Questions
The objective in this phase is to develop a Digital Ambition for the business model.
Here, the objectives are set in terms of the digital transformation and related
business model dimensions.
The Digital Ambition phase answers the following questions:
– In light of the digital transformation, what are the objectives for each category
(time, finances, space, quality)?
– How should the objectives for each of the business model dimensions be
prioritized?
Description (How can the customer be described in
detail (e.g. age, gender, marital status, hobbies,
residence, character, etc.)?
Matthias Meyer, 45 Years-Old, male,…
Relationships (What relationships does the customer
have (e.g. Social Context, Relationships, Family, etc.)?
Contacts with other maintenance specialists,
contacts with pilots,…
Influencers (Who influences the customer (e.g. family,
Friends, etc.)?
Supervisor, colleagues,…
See (What does the customer see and how is their
environment shaped?)
Stressed colleagues who doe not receive their spare
parts for engine maintenances on time,…
Hear (What does the customer hear around their
environment?)
“…the spare part is not in stock and will be available
in three days”,…
Think/Feel (What is going on in the mind of a customer?
What are their feelings? What bothers them?)
How can I manage to reach my goals with regard to
maintenance?...

6.3 Digital Ambition: Setting Objectives 51
6.3.2 Activities and Tools
For the Digital Ambition phase, there is an activity which is described below with
the corresponding instrument.
Set Goals and Prioritize Business Model Dimensions
Objectives are set according to four categories for the existing business model and
integrated business model elements. The categories include: time, finances, space,
and quality (in accordance with: O ¨ sterle 2013: 109; Schallmo 2013: 194; Kreutzer
and Land 2016: 48).
Under the category: “time,” objectives are set which relate to the temporal aspects
of the business model (such as faster service provision, faster production, etc.).
Within the “finance” category, objectives are set which relate to the financial
aspects of the business model (e.g., cost savings, sales, etc.).
Under the category “space”, objectives are determined which take the spatial
aspects of the business model (e.g., networking, automation, etc.) into account.
The “quality” category contains objectives that relate to qualitative aspects of
the business model (relationship quality, product quality, process quality, etc.).
Table 6.1 shows the objective categories and also include business model
elements as examples.
These categories take all relevant aspects into consideration as opposed to only
focusing on temporal aspects. The objectives which are set can affect several
categories and therefore overlap. Although some overlap will exist, the objectives
should still be prioritized. Lastly, the business model dimensions can also be
prioritized.
Table 6.1 Categories for objectives including business model elements
Category Objectives based on the business model elements
Time – Response to disruptions within 6 hr
– Reduction of production time to 30 days
– Delivery within 12 h
– . . .
Finance – Reduction of sales costs by 30%
– Reduction of internal logistics costs by 25%
– Increase of service revenue by 35%

52 6 Roadmap for the Digital Transformation of Business Models
6.4 Digital Potential: Establishing Options
6.4.1 Objectives and Questions
The objective in this phase is to identify the Digital Potential of the business model.
Here, best practices and enablers of digital transformation are gathered, and they
subsequently inform future digital business model options.
The Digital Potential phase addresses and answers the following questions:
– What best practices exist within and outside of our own industry? What is the
initial situation, problem definition, objective, approach, and result in each
case?
– What enablers are available for the digital transformation? How can these
enablers be assigned to the following four categories: digital data, automation,
networking, and digital customer access?
– How should the future digital business model be designed? What options are
available?
6.4.2 Activities and Tools
Within the scope of the activities, several tools are used to develop targeted results.
Rise of Best Practices for Digital Transformation
In order to come up with ideas for the digital transformation of a business model,
the best practices from one’s own and other industries are determined and described
(Bucherer 2011: 77; Giesen et al. 2007: 32; Schallmo 2013: 185).
Table 6.2 shows possible criteria and explanations in order to uniformly
describe best practices.
A set of best practices for digital transformations can be found in the existing
literature (Brand et al. 2009; Boue´e and Schaible 2015: 9; Botthof and
Bovenschulte 2009: 15; Hoffmeister 2017; Jahn and Pfeiffer 2014: 81; Bauernhansl
and Emmrich 2015: 24).
The Rise of Digital Transformation Enablers
An enabler allows applications or services to be used for the digital transformation
of the business model.
6.4 Digital Potential: Establishing Options 53
There are four categories of enablers and applications/services (based on:
Boue´e and Schaible 2015: 19):
– Digital Data: The collection, processing, and analysis of digitized data to
facilitate and improve predictions and decisions.
– Automation: The combination of classical artificial intelligence technologies
that enable autonomous work and self-organizing systems. This
reduces error rates, increases speed, and makes it possible to reduce
operating costs.
– Digital Customer Access: The mobile internet provides direct access to
the client, who in turn is provided with higher levels of transparency and
new services.
– Networking: Using broadband telecommunications for the mobile or
wired networking of the entire value-added chain allows for the synchronization
of supply chains, which leads to a reduction in production times
and shorter innovation cycles.
Enablers are listed with their applications/services in a Digital Radar,
which is shown in Fig. 6.6.
The Digital Radar can accommodate more enablers and applications as needed.
The following is an example of additive manufacturing for bionic aircraft components.
Additive manufacturing can also be used for the printing of spare parts for
engines (Knabel 2014).
Airbus installed a bionic-shaped bracket in an A350 test aircraft in July 2014
and has already flown with it. The component was sintered with titanium

powder and it has the same specifications as a conventional component with
regards to function and strength. Advantages include:
– Less material and less weight (30% lighter)
– Reduction of fuel consumption
– Increased supply chain flexibility, as Airbus can sinter spare parts on site
per original specifications without depending on large manufacturing
facilities or waiting on deliveries. There is an example of an Airbus bionic
and conventional components in Fig. 6.7.
By leveraging enablers of digital transformation, it is possible to design a new
business model, a digital customer experience, and a digital value creation network
that utilizes the enablers within that value creation network (Boue´e and Schaible
2015: 19).
Designing Options for the Future Digital Business Model
Based on best practices and the enablers, the future structures of individual business
model elements are now considered. Here, it is crucial to first list all options,
without making an assessment. The two key questions are:
– What business model elements are to be digitized and in what form? Benchmarks
for consumption data could be provided (e.g. via platforms).
– How can enablers from the Digital Radar be used to improve business model
elements? The improvement of the maintenance process or rather the predictability
of maintenance intervals for an engine for example, could be possible
(e.g., via the use of big data).

6.4 Digital Potential: Establishing Options 55
Figure 6.8 shows the option space for a future digital business model with
attributes tailor-made for an engine manufacturer.
The design of the options for the future business model is based upon the
objectives which have been established. The options for the business model should
also consider customer requirements and all of the actors within the value chain,
and thus come up with ideas for the design of a digital customer experience and the
digital value creation network.
The design of a future business model is done within a framework that captures
various options in addition to fundamental, digital business model patterns and
includes best practices and enablers (Hoffmeister 2017; Esser 2014).
6.5 Digital Fit: Suitability Evaluation
6.5.1 Objectives and Questions
The objective in this phase is to evaluate the suitability of the digital business
model. Appropriate combinations of options are defined and integrated into the
existing business model. Finally, the combinations are evaluated in terms of
business model fit, the fulfillment of customer requirements, and the achievement
of objectives.
Fig. 6.7 Bionic and conventional components (Source: Flugrevue 2016)
56 6 Roadmap for the Digital Transformation of Business Models
The Digital Fit phase addresses and answers the following questions:
– What coherent combinations exist within the options space?
– How can the combinations be evaluated in terms of suitability within the existing
business model?
– How can the combination be evaluated with respect to the fulfilment of customer
requirements?
– How can the combinations be evaluated with respect to the objectives of the
digital transformation?
6.5.2 Activities and Tools
Within this framework of activities, several tools are used to develop targeted
results.
Set of Combinations Options
Suitable combinations are determined for the options selected. This means that the
options must be mutually compatible. Afterwards, the different option combinations
can be integrated into the existing business model.
In Fig. 6.9, two different versions of existing business models are shown with
options.

Evaluate Combinations
The evaluation of various combinations takes place with an eye to business model
suitability, the fulfillment of customer requirements, and the achievement of the
stated objectives.
Criteria for suitability with existing business model:
– How does the combination of options fit with existing members of the Customer
Dimension?
– How does the combination of options fit with existing elements of the Benefit
Dimension?
– How does the combination of options fit with existing elements of the Value
Creation Dimension?
– How does the combination of options fit to existing elements of the Partner
Dimension?
– How does the combination of options fit to the existing elements of the Financial
Dimension?
Criteria for the fulfillment of customer requirements:
– How does the combination of options contribute to the fulfillment of functional
benefits?
– How does the combination of options contribute to the fulfillment of economic
benefits?
– How does the combination of options contribute to the fulfillment of processrelated
benefits?
– How does the combination of options contribute to the fulfillment of emotional
benefits?
– How does the combination of options contribute to the fulfillment of social
benefits?
Criteria for the achievement of objectives:
– How does the combination of options contribute to the achievement of temporal
objectives?
– How does the combination of options contribute to the achievement of financial
objectives?
– How does the combination of options contribute to the achievement of spatial
objectives?
– How does the combination of options contribute to the achievement of qualitative
objectives?
Based on the criteria listed, the combinations are evaluated in a scoring table in
order to prioritize them. An example scoring table is shown in Fig. 6.10.
With this evaluation of digital suitability, different paths and the preferences of
the company are taken into account in each of the initial situations in order to drive
the digital transformation (IBM Institute for Business Value 2011). The IBM
Institute for Business Value defines these two dimensions: The “what” is the change
of the benefit for the customer and the “how” is the design of the operational model.
6.5 Digital Fit: Suitability Evaluation 59
This results in three paths: 1) digitization of business processes, 2) digitization of
benefit offers, and 3) development of future necessary competencies.
Based on these specifications, two perspectives are proposed from previous
versions: internal and external digitization. Subsequently, this results in three
paths (IBM Institute for Business Value 2011; Esser 2014):
Internal: Transformation of benefits and the value creation dimension; for
example:
– Creation of new digital products such as eBooks, apps, etc.
– Extension of the existing product offering to include digital platforms and
technologies such as E-business and M-Commerce
– Application of technologies to reduce costs in the supply chain and management
processes
– Application of technologies to carry out, for example, (worldwide) virtual
conferences
External: Transformation of the customer and partner dimension and the valueadded
chain:
– Application of tracking and analysis tools to analyze customer behaviors and to
make predictions regarding future purchasing behaviors
– Application of multiple, integrated channels such as branches, cell phones,
websites, and social media for an improved customer experience
– Direct: Parallel internal and external transformation.
The paths dependent on the perspectives are shown in Fig. 6.11.

6.6 Digital Implementation: Enabling the Realization
6.6.1 Objectives and Questions
The objective in this phase is to carry out the digital implementation of the business
model. The digital business model is finalized and implemented. In addition, the
digital customer experience and the digital value creation Network are designed.
This phase of digital implementation addresses and answers the following
questions:
– How can the digital business model be finalized and implemented? What
changes should be made to the existing business model and in what order? In
addition, which projects are necessary?
– How should the digital customer experience be designed? What digital enablers
should be used and what applications are produced accordingly?
– How should the digital value creation network be designed and how should
partners be integrated? What enablers should be used and which applications are
thus produced?
– What resources and skills are generally required to carry out the digital
implementation?

6.6.2 Activities and Tools
Within the framework of activities, tools are used to achieve targeted results.
Finalization and Implementation the Digital Business Model
Based on the previous evaluation, the most promising combination of options is
integrated into the business model in order to finalize it. Then a project and plan of
action are developed to implement the final business model. Here, necessary
resources and capabilities also play a role in creating the digital business model.
Figure 6.12 shows the embedding of the “engine” product into the business
model and the system of systems. Various developmental stages are also shown in
Fig. 6.12. The idea of the development originates from Porter and Heppelmann
(2014: 44).
The product is an engine installed in an aircraft. The intelligent product provides
data collected by engine sensors that allow one to target fuel consumption and
possible optimization. When the engine within the aircraft is networked (e.g.,
landing flaps are controllable), it is considered an intelligent, networked product.
The networking can also be done with the entire airline fleet, or fleets of other
airlines.
When more services are added to the intelligent and networked product, then it is
a product system. In the present example, it is an aircraft system that includes
navigation services, fuel management, and risk management (GE 2016a).
The navigation service enables a reduction in miles flown and therefore reduced
fuel consumption. In addition, the navigation service contributes to improving the
planning and implementation of performance-related navigation procedures. Here,
experts from various domains have access to this system which facilitates the
implementation of tailor-made customer solutions.

62 6 Roadmap for the Digital Transformation of Business Models
Fuel management involves providing insights to achieve sustainable fuel savings.
Fuel management includes analysis and reporting capabilities to provide
insights for additional savings.
Risk management ensures flight safety and fleet productivity with flight-data
analysis software. The evaluation and validation of multiple data sources, such as
flight, weather, and navigation data is done with the help of automated integration.
The functions can be adapted to all fleet types. Precise analysis capabilities also
include customizable navigation.
On the one hand, at each stage of development, benefits are generated for
customers (e.g., cost savings) and customer loyalty increases accordingly. This
also allows for greater differentiation from competitors. On the other hand, however,
the complexity, the number of partners, and thus the costs for the provider for
each stage of development will also increase.
Design of Digital Customer Experience
The digital customer experience is now developed based upon the customer
requirements which were collected in the first phase. In doing so, the most important
phases from the customer’s perspective are determined. Requirements, tasks,
and prerequisite experience are established for each phase, and services as well as
digital enablers are defined (in accordance with: Stickdorn et al. 2011: 158;
Curedale 2013: 213).
In order to analyze the most important phases from the customer’s perspective, a
valid description of the digital customer experience is developed. This is presented
in Fig. 6.13 (based on: Schallmo and Brecht 2014: 104; Schallmo 2013: 209).
Depending on the industry, customer, and business model, other phases may also
be relevant from the customer’s perspective. Moreover, the phases should be
worked out individually. In Fig. 6.14, an example taken from the use of an aircraft
engine is used to demonstrate a digital customer experience design.

6.6 Digital Implementation: Enabling the Realization 63
Design of the Digital Value Creation Network and Partner Integration
Based on the analysis of the value-added chain and actors, as well as the final
business model, the design of the digital value creation network is determined and
integrated with partners.
It is at this point that someone must be found to fill the role of integrator. Digital
enablers are also needed to form the value creation network. Figure 6.15 shows the
integrated digital value creation network.
During the final phase, it is crucial that the finalization and implementation of the
business model, the design of the digital value creation network, and the design of
the digital customer experience are done iteratively. This means that adjustments
can be made based on iterative tests.

6.7 Intelligent Business Model as an Ideal Condition
In the ideal scenario, the processes described above conclude and result in an
intelligent business model which is characterized by a sophisticated technological
infrastructure that is integrated into a cloud. This is equivalent to the system of
systems, which is shown in Fig. 6.12. Figure 6.16 shows an intelligent business
model with a technological infrastructure, within a cloud (in accordance with Porter
and Heppelmann 2015: 57).
The starting point for this ideal scenario is a business model with products,
services, processes, etc., using hardware and software. The software includes
embedded operating systems, software applications, and an advanced user interface.
The hardware includes embedded sensors and processors, network connections
and antennas, in addition to traditional mechanical components. By
networking the business model, network communication between products, services,
processes, etc. is made possible within a cloud.
An intelligent business model within a cloud performs intelligent applications,
implements rule analysis engines, operates an application platform, and uses a

database. The intelligent applications use cloud features that can monitor, control,
optimize, and also be run at least somewhat autonomously.
The engine analysis contains rules, business logic, and big-data analysis capabilities.
It provides information and enables new insights into products, services,
processes, etc. The application platform includes a development environment in
which intelligent, networked applications with data access, visualization, and
run-time tools can be created quickly. Within the database, historical and current
data is aggregated, normalized, and managed.
The intelligent business model within the cloud is tied to corporate systems and
linked to intelligent business models by customers and partners within the cloud. In
addition, there is a network with external data sources.
Within the framework of connection-to-connection enterprise systems, tools are
used that deliver data from intelligent, networked business models to core systems
(ERP, CRM, and PLM). External data sources include connections to information
from external sources that serve as a database (e.g., weather, traffic, energy prices,
social media, geo-location) for business model functions. User identities and
security are ensured with tools that facilitate the management of user profiles and

68 6 Roadmap for the Digital Transformation of Business Models
Chapter 7
Summary
This book provided two insightful definitions for the digital transformation of
business models in Chap. 2.
Then, in Chap. 3, the definition of the digital transformation of business models
was developed within a synthesis of previous works. Finally, the future of digital
transformation was considered.
In Chap. 4, four examples of successful digital business model transformations
were presented, complete with the initial starting point, problems to be solved,
objectives, solution approach, results, and application to the first phase, Digital
Reality.
In Chap. 5, existing approaches to digital transformation were outlined and these
were also used as the basis for the Roadmap.
In Chap. 6, the Roadmap was explained along with its five phases: Digital
Reality, Digital Ambition, Digital Potential, Digital Fit, and Digital Implementation.
The phases of the Roadmap were discussed along with their respective
objectives and the relevant questions which need to be asked when establishing
those objectives. Afterwards, innovative activities were put forth, each with its
corresponding tools. Finally, the procedure model was presented, which summarizes
all the phases of the Roadmap and contains objectives, activities, and results.
The Roadmap and the procedure model for the digital transformation of business
models is based on existing approaches and experiences which were garnered
within the framework of consulting and research projects.

ARE YOU READY?
Technology is the biggest story in business today, plain and simple.
There are other big stories, of course. The Great Recession of
2007–2009 and subsequent sovereign debt crises were hugely Â�important
events; they affected the fortunes of countless people and companies,
and their impact is far from over. Globalization and offshoring are also
key forces shaping strategy and structure both now and for some time
to come. Demographics are shifting in ways that will cause deep and
lasting changes in markets.
These are big deals, but technology is bigger. It’s bigger because
recent progress in all things digital is removing constraints and creating
exciting new possibilities that affect everyone’s lives and enterprises.
Do you want to finally hear the voice of your customers and escape the
narrow lenses of surveys and focus groups? Social media let you. Do
you want all of your people to be available and productive no matter
where they are? Mobile computing makes that possible. Want significantly
better forecasts, judgments, and decisions in key areas? That’s
the promise of big data. Want to roll out entirely new organizational
structures, business processes, and customer offerings, and to quickly
modify them over time as circumstances change? We all know these
things are possible because we’ve seen companies doing all of them.
The tech wave has been building for a long time, but has Â�accelerated
in recent years. The past decade has witnessed a remarkable run of
2 LEADING DIGITAL
progress in digital technologies. The phrase Web 2.0 entered popular
use in 2004 to signify a deep change under way on the World Wide
Web: a great democratization of content creation. The rise of Facebook,
Twitter, Wikipedia, and many other utilities full of user-generated content
shows that there really is a new version of the Web. Moreover,
a new generation of computing devices seems likely to challenge, if
not completely overturn, the decades-long dominance of the personal
computer as the device of choice for knowledge workers. Apple’s twin
breakthroughs—the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010—ushered
in the era of the smartphone and the tablet and made real the longstanding
promises of mobile computing. These technology advances
are staggering, but the real impact is how they are changing the way we
live and work. Companies, and people, can do things that would have
been impossible a decade ago.
The data center has been disrupted as much as the desktop has
in recent years, thanks to the rapid rise of cloud computing, which is
calling into question the standard assumption that you have to own
Â�technologies like servers, operating systems, and applications if you
want to use them. Enterprise applications, social networks, mobile
devices, sensors, and just about every other element of modern digital
infrastructure generate scads of data—so much that we really do need
to use the modifier big now to distinguish the current era. These and
many other innovations are being combined to bring us the sharing
economy, supercomputers that win game shows, cars that drive themselves,
and a host of other novelties that fundamentally challenge our
thinking about business structure, labor costs, and the relationship
between people and machines.
The last time there was this much technological innovation hitting
the business world was the first time. It was the Industrial Revolution,
when new machines bent the curve of commerce, capitalism, and,
indeed, human history. Today, innovation in digital technologies is
bringing our world into what one of us (Andy) and his coauthor Erik
Brynjolfsson called “the second machine age” in their 2014 book of the
same name.
Are You Ready? 3
Are you ready for the second machine age? With all due respect,
you’re probably not.
We say this because for the past three years, we’ve been conducting
research on how firms around the world and in many industries work
with digital technologies. We’ve collected data and interviewed people
at hundreds of companies. We’ve talked with executives and examined
the companies’ performance. We’ve studied both how the companies
approach all things digital and the results of their efforts.
Our most fundamental conclusion is that Digital Masters—Â�
companies that use digital technologies to drive significantly higher
levels of profit, productivity, and performance—do exist, but they’re
rare. For reasons that we’ll explain here, most firms fall short of digital
mastery. That’s the bad news, and it’s why we believe you’re probably
not ready to survive and thrive in the second machine age.
Here’s the good news: the reasons that companies fall short of
digital mastery aren’t mysterious or too numerous to list. In fact, the
reasons are pretty easy to categorize. Companies that struggle with
becoming truly digital fail to develop digital capabilities to work differently
and the leadership capabilities required to set a vision and execute
on it. The firms that excel at both digital and leadership capabilities are
Digital Masters.
If you read the business press about technology, you might well surmise
that most Digital Masters are American; that most American masters
reside in Northern California, the Pacific Northwest, or New England;
and that most of these companies are in the hardware and software businesses.
And certainly, giants like Apple, Facebook, and Amazon.com,
and start-ups from San Francisco to Boston are excellent users of technology.
But these aren’t the Digital Masters we’re talking about.
In fact, we didn’t even include them in our research. We wanted to
understand how technology was being adopted and used in the 90-plus
percent of the economy that doesn’t do technology for a living. So we didn’t
look at Silicon Valley’s stars. And we didn’t look at start-ups and other
small companies either, because their tech-related opportunities and
challenges are quite different from those faced by large enterprises.
4 LEADING DIGITAL
We focused on big companies, in industries from finance to
Â�manufacturing to pharmaceuticals. These companies power much of the
economy, but are rarely mentioned in the technology news. Not all of
them are Digital Masters, but still, many are doing amazing things with
technology. We also spent a lot of our time looking outside the United
States, for the simple reason that most of the world is there. The diffusion
of business technology is a global phenomenon, and we wanted
to understand what was happening around the world. So we conducted
research at large enterprises from around the globe to understand their
approaches to harnessing the many recent waves of innovation in information
and communication technology and to see which approaches
worked best. We discovered all kinds of companies, both those struggling
and those succeeding in the great challenge of becoming digital. As
we explained above, the companies that are succeeding—and they range
across industries and sectors—we’re calling Digital Masters. And Digital
Masters outperform their peers. Our work indicates that the masters are
26 percent more profitable than their average industry competitors. They
generate 9 percent more revenue with their existing physical capacity and
drive more efficiency in their existing products and processes.
As we’ll show, achieving digital mastery is not an impossible task or
arcane art. It doesn’t require that you hire away Google’s top talent or
spend 20 percent of revenue on technology every year. It does require
some level of human capital and investment, of course, but the main
requirements are time, tenacity, and leadership. With these, knowledgeable
companies can assemble the elements of technological progress
into a mosaic not just once, but continuously over time. Digital
Masters, in short, keep making digital technologies work for them even
though the technologies themselves keep changing.
Our research has convinced us—and with this book, we hope to
convince you—that digital mastery is an achievable goal for any enterprise.
We’ll give many examples of what digital mastery looks like,
why it’s important, and how it can be developed. We hope that you’ll
find the examples compelling, and that you’ll use our work to help you
embark on your own journey toward becoming a Digital Master.
Are You Ready? 5
This is an important journey because when it comes to the impact of
digital technologies on the business world, we ain’t seen nothin’ yet. The
innovations and disruptions of the past ten years have been nothing short
of astonishing, but they’re just the warm-up acts for what’s to come.
Robots will become more dexterous, mobile, and aware of their
surroundings. They will start showing up not only on factory floors, but
also in warehouses, stockrooms, and retail environments. Their close
cousins, autonomous vehicles, will start driving and flying at first in
remote areas, and then probably in populated ones.
The data these drones generate will be combined with the streams
from countless sensors as we instrument (in other words, slap a sensor
on) just about everything. As the entrepreneur Gil Elbaz puts it,
“The world is one big data problem.”1 The coming years will show
that if Elbaz’s comment is an overstatement, it’s not much of one.
Digital Masters will take this torrent of data; combine it with the latest
Â�innovations in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and visualization;
and use the resulting insights to make smarter decisions, see the
future more clearly, drive out inefficiencies, and better understand their
customers. Everyone else will fall behind.
No one can predict all the digital innovations that the coming
years will bring. Perhaps the best general prediction is an expansion of
what inventor, entrepreneur, and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen
wrote in a 2011 Wall Street Journal column: “Why Software Is Eating
the World.”2 We wholeheartedly agree and just want to expand on his
point: the elements of the digital world—software, hardware, Â�networks,
and data—are pervading the business world, and they’re doing so
quickly, broadly, and deeply. Regardless of industry or geography, businesses
will become much more digitized in the future. It’s inevitable—
so the time to start pursuing digital mastery is now.
If you want to become a Digital Master, read on. Chapter 1 defines
digital mastery: what it is, what it means, and how it varies from
Â�company to company and from industry to industry. Our research has
identified the key characteristics that make companies Digital Masters.
What these masters have done, though not easy, can be adopted by any
6 LEADING DIGITAL
company willing to follow a similar path. Digital Masters excel at two
essential capabilities. They build digital capabilities by rethinking and
improving their business processes, their customer engagements, and
their business models. They also build strong leadership capabilities
to envision and drive transformation. Each dimension of capability is
important on its own. Together, they make you a Digital Master.
The next two parts of the book examine the two critical capabilities
that constitute the DNA of digital mastery in turn. Part I focuses
on digital capability. It is the what of digital mastery—the investments
and initiatives that executives have undertaken to transform the way
their companies operate. Chapter 2 examines the most visible aspect
of digital capabilities—how you engage with customers. This capability
goes beyond websites and mobile apps to truly change the customer
experience. Chapter 3 explores a far less visible, but equally important
element of digital capability, namely, operational processes. Digital technology
allows companies to break some of the traditional paradoxes of
operational excellence, helping you to build capabilities that improve
efficiency and agility, power new customer engagements, and enable
new business models—all while remaining largely hidden from your
competitors. Finally, chapter 4 discusses new business models, from
reconfiguring delivery models to creating new products and services to
reinventing whole industries. Through these models, you can gain an
advantage over your competitors and outwit new entrants.
Part II focuses on the other critical dimension, leadership capabilities.
These are the how of digital mastery—the ways in which executives
are driving change. Large companies are prone to both inertia
and entropy; it can be tough to get started, and even tougher to keep
things moving in the same direction. The only effective way we’ve seen
to drive transformation is top-down, through strong senior executive
direction coupled with methods that engage workers in making the
change happen. Chapter 5 shows how to create a transformative digital
vision. Vision sets the aspirations for your company, but many companies
lack this essential part of driving transformation. Chapter 6 then
describes a distinctive approach to engagement, which is the process of
Are You Ready? 7
energizing employees to make the vision a reality. Chapter 7 Â�examines
digital governance. Vision and engagement are just part of the story
of leadership capabilities. An energized workforce, believing strongly
in a shared vision, may still proceed in many directions. Governance
provides the guardrails and steering wheel to keep the transformation
on the right track. Finally, chapter 8 examines the technology Â�leadership
capabilities you will need to power your transformation forward: the
strong relationship that Digital Masters build between their IT and
business leaders, and the way these companies use that relationship to
drive change in their internal platforms and digital skills.
Part III constitutes what we call the leader’s playbook for digital
transformation. This toolset, synthesized from the insights in previous
sections, provides concrete management guidance to help get you
started in creating your own digital advantage. Chapter 9 is the starting
point: framing the digital challenge. It shows how to build awareness,
understand your starting point, craft a vision, and align your senior
executive team around it. Chapter 10 shows how to focus your investments.
It provides advice on how to translate your vision into action,
build the required governance, and fund your transformation. Chapter
11 is about mobilizing the organization to make the transformation happen—
signaling your ambitions, earning the right to engage, setting
new behaviors, and starting to evolve the company’s culture. Finally,
chapter 12 discusses how to sustain the change. It includes building
foundation skills, aligning incentives and reward structures, and continuously
monitoring progress. Although each topic in Part III could
be a book on its own, each chapter contains a self-diagnostic exercise,
as well as some useful examples and techniques to help you get started.
Our overarching conclusion from this work is simple: we ain’t
seen nothin’ yet. Within the next ten years, industries, economies, and
probably entire societies will be transformed by a barrage of technologies
that until recently have existed only in science fiction, but are now
entering and reshaping the business world. Becoming a Digital Master
is challenging, but there has never been a better time. The longer you
wait, the more difficult it will become.

WHAT IS DIGITAL
MASTERY?
If people knew how hard I worked to get my
mastery, it wouldn’t seem so wonderful at all.
—Michelangelo
Sporting goods company Nike has built its business on innovation.
According to CEO Mark Parker, “We’re an innovation company .Â€.Â€.
Innovation and design is at the epicenter of all we do.”1 That innovation
focus goes beyond Nike’s products to include the way it engages
with customers and even the way it manages internal operations. And
digital technology is making new kinds of innovation possible.2
Online customers can order personalized shoes in hundreds of
color combinations. Digital tools have made product design and
manufacturing faster and more efficient than ever before. Additional
digital capabilities have helped Nike to improve visibility and performance
in its operations, increasing efficiency, reducing waste,
and enhancing corporate social responsibility in the company’ global
supply chain.
10 LEADING DIGITAL
Social media enable Nike to be an integral part of the Â�conversation
around major sports, sporting events, and sporting apparel. And Nike’s
digital products, such as the FuelBand, allow athletes to track their
workouts, share their performance online, and even receive advice from
digital “coaches.” Meanwhile, both social media and digital products
provide Nike with rich data on customers, their activities, and their
preferences.
These innovations arise in different parts of the company as managers
constantly seek new ways to improve. According to CEO Parker,
“I always like to say that we focus on our potential and the distance
between where we are and our potential, not the distance between us
and our competition. That’s where a leader should be. And as you focus
on that space, you’re gonna create some incredible things.”3
Yet in 2010, Nike executives decided to invest in something different.
They created a new business unit, called Nike Digital Sport, to build
new digital products and reimagine how Nike could engage with customers
across its categories. Marketers, designers, and engineers work
together to develop and launch products under the Nike+ banner. The
unit also helps other parts of Nike develop their digital efforts. Its “innovation
kitchen” produces new designs and techniques ranging from marketing
to manufacturing. Its accelerator program is building the firm’s
digital ecosystem. Analysts mine mountains of data, gathered from
Nike’s digital products and marketing efforts, to get ever closer to customers
around the world.
According to Nike’s global digital brand and innovation director,
Jesse Stolak, “The goal hasn’t changed since the beginning of Nike—
we want to connect with athletes to inspire and enable them to be better.”
4 No longer just a seller of products, Nike is becoming part of its
customers’ lives.
Nike’s story is not unique. Asian Paints is India’s largest paint
company and Asia’s third-largest paint company, with revenue of
$1.8Â€Â�billion.5 It has been able to globalize and maintain fast growth, more
than 15 percent annually for a decade, while increasing efficiency, transforming
customer experience, and reducing its environmental impact.6
What Is Digital Mastery? 11
Having built a digital advantage serving India’s billion-person economy,
Asian Paints has expanded to seventeen countries around the world.
None of this would have been possible without successive waves of digital
transformation over the past decade.
According to CIO and head of strategy Manish Choksi, a challenge
of the company has been “to drive efficiency and growth in a business
spread over 120 locations, which deals directly with twenty thousand
to thirty thousand retailers.”7 After first unifying the company through
strong IT systems for manufacturing, order processing, and supply
chain, the company was on a good foundation for growth. This set the
stage for a series of transformations. Centralizing the routine customer
order-taking process into a single corporate call center increased efficiency
and customer service. The firm’s salespeople then transformed
from clipboard-carrying order takers to always-connected relationship
managers. New automated plants produced higher product quality and
environmental safety than labor-intensive plants did. Expanding into
services—selling painted walls instead of cans of paint—provided benefits
beyond new revenues. Providing the service ensured that high-end
products were applied properly, thereby improving customer satisfaction,
and helped the firm get closer to end consumers that it didn’t typically
meet.8 As Asian Paints’ website affirms, digital transformation
will continue into the future: “The road ahead is to integrate all our
stakeholders including suppliers, employees and customers and create
an extended enterprise.”9
Nike and Asian Paints are in very different industries. The companies
have very different products, customers, and histories. But they
have something in common: the way they use digital technologies to
drive their businesses forward. As two examples of Digital Masters,
Nike and Asian Paints are using digital technologies to transform the
way they do business. Digital Masters use technology better than their
competitors do and gain huge benefits. The benefits occur not only in
visible customer interactions, but also in less visible internal Â�operations.
The advantages are apparent in the financials; Digital Masters are
Â�substantially more profitable than their peers.10
12 LEADING DIGITAL
But what do Digital Masters do differently? How can you become a
Digital Master? Nike and Asian Paints did not start as Digital Masters.
They built their digital advantage over time. And they did it through
different paths. But both came to realize what our research has shown:
Digital Masters do more than just invest in digital capabilities. They
create the leadership capabilities to get the most from their digital
activities. We’ll show you how.
THE DNA OF DIGITAL MASTERS
We started our research with a simple but broad question: how are
large companies around the world using fast-evolving new digital technologies
in their businesses? When we started our research, we didn’t
have specific dimensions or practices in mind. We just knew that big
companies were doing far more than we were hearing in the media.
And we were intrigued by the juxtaposition of speeds between the digital
technology industries and the slower, more deliberative cultures of
large firms in many other industries.
We’ve learned over the years that when we are faced with a big
question that doesn’t have clear answers, the best thing to do is see
how executives are actually answering the question for themselves. So,
we talked with executives in large companies—150 executives in fifty
companies around the world—to understand how these leaders were
thinking about new digital challenges, and what they were doing with
new technologies.
We found that most of the companies were already investing in
technologies such as social media, mobility, analytics, and embedded
devices. But some—the firms we call Digital Masters—were making
far better progress than others. Comparing these companies and the
rest of the pack helped us identify differences in how the masters conceptualized
and managed their digital activities. We found that it’s not
just what they invest in, but it’s how they lead change that makes these
companies Digital Masters.11 After testing our theory in a global survey
of nearly four hundred companies, we became even more convinced.
What Is Digital Mastery? 13
Digital Masters excel in two critical dimensions: the what of
Â�technology (which we call digital capabilities) and the how of leading
change (which we call leadership capabilities). These are two very distinct
dimensions of digital mastery, and each plays its own role. What
you invest in matters, to a point. How you use those investments to
transform your company is a key to success. Neither dimension is
enough on its own. Each is associated with different types of financial
performance, and each provides only partial advantage.12 Taken
together, they combine to give Digital Masters a clear advantage over
their competitors.
Digital Capabilities
Digital Masters know where and how to invest in the digital opportunity.
The size of the investment is not as important as the reason—and
the impact. Digital Masters see technology as a way to change the way
they do business—their customer engagements, internal operations,
and even business models. To these companies, new technologies such
as social media, mobility, and analytics are not goals to attain or signals
to send their customers and investors. These technologies are tools to
get closer to customers, empower their employees, and transform their
internal business processes.
But more than technology is needed. While the changes possible
through smart digital investment are impressive, they are not enough.
Companies that invest in the right areas have higher revenue for each
unit of their existing physical capacity (such as people and facilities)
than their competitors, but they are no more profitable. Gaining the
true digital advantage also requires leadership.
Leadership Capabilities
For Digital Masters, committed leadership is more than just a buzzword.
It is the lever that turns technology into transformation.
Despite the advice of many gurus to “let a thousand flowers bloom”
14 LEADING DIGITAL
in your company, we saw no examples of successful transformation
happening bottom-up. Instead, executives in every Digital Master
steered the transformation through strong top-down leadership: setting
direction, building momentum, and ensuring that the company
follows through.
Top-down leadership does not mean that you need to plan out the
transformation in complete detail from the start. Nor does it mean that
you can just energize the company and wait for great things to happen.
In the Digital Masters we studied, leaders created a clear and broad
vision of the future, started some critical initiatives, and then engaged
their employees to build out the vision over time. The leaders stayed
involved throughout the transformation to make the case for change, to
drive the change forward, and to redirect activities and behaviors that
went against the vision. And they continually looked for ways to extend
the vision and move the company to the next level of digital advantage.
As Asian Paints, Nike, and others have learned, every step on the road
to transformation opens up new possibilities to exploit and extend the
company’s digital advantage.
Top-down leadership does mean strong governance and coordination.
It is very difficult to ensure that all parts of a complex company
move in the right direction at the right pace. People in different units
often do their own thing or wait before committing to a new way of
action. The true advantage comes from linking different digital activities,
and that can only happen if people are on the same page. Nike
built Nike Digital Sport in 2010 to provide coordination, innovation,
and some shared resources for the company’s many digital efforts.13
Coffee powerhouse Starbucks created the position of chief digital officer
in 2012 for the same reason.14 Asian Paints extended the role of the
chief information officer (CIO) to cover strategy as well as IT. Other
firms find that digital steering committees are enough. The roles are
less important than the results. All Digital Masters find ways to build a
clear vision of a radically different future, engage their employees in the
goal, foster strong bonds between technical and businesspeople, and
steer the course through strong governance.
What Is Digital Mastery? 15
FOUR LEVELS OF DIGITAL MASTERY
If Digital Masters like Nike and Asian Paints represent excellence on
both digital and leadership dimensions, what about other firms? Each
dimension is different, and each is important for different reasons.
Putting the two dimensions together yields four levels of digital mastery
(figure 1-1). Digital Masters excel at both dimensions, but most
companies do not. Some companies are strong on digital capabilities
but weak on leadership capabilities. Some are the reverse. Still others
are weak on both dimensions; they have not yet begun the digital
journey.
Beginners are just at the start of the digital journey. Many of them
adopt a wait-and-see strategy, trying to gain certainty before they act.
Some believe the digital opportunity is right for other industries, but
not for theirs. Others lack the leadership to make something Â�happen.
As a result, Beginners have only basic digital capabilities. AndÂ€ they

Figure 1.1

lag behind their competitors on multiple measures of financial
performance.
Many Beginners use regulation or privacy as an excuse for Â�inaction.
Meanwhile, their competitors are not waiting to act. Many insurance
companies have been slow to adopt social media because of regulatory
challenges in allowing their agents to use blogs and social media Â�messages.
But Northwestern Mutual found a safe way to put its agents on LinkedIn
so the financial representatives can build and maintain relationships.15
Similarly, many medical and pharmaceutical companies are wary of regulatory
and privacy concerns in using social media. But a medical device
company used social media to inform medical providers about a gamechanging
new device far faster than traditional media could have done.16
Fashionistas are not waiting to act. They buy every new digital
Â�bauble. They flaunt their technological trendiness but don’t change
what’s behind the veneer. However, because they lack strong digital
leadership and governance, they waste much of what they spend. Or
they find that they need to reverse what they’ve done so that they can
integrate and scale their capabilities. One company we studied built
employee collaboration platforms in different parts of the business
using different (and incompatible) technologies. Employees could collaborate
within their silos, but couldn’t share knowledge across the
company. Another company had three mobile marketing initiatives, in
different parts of the company, addressing overlapping markets. The
mobile solutions used different vendors and different technology sets,
so they could not build on each other.
Although there is nothing wrong with trying experiments to find
the best solution, neither of these Fashionistas had mechanisms to
coordinate their activities or build synergies across their investments.
Building a wide variety of incompatible processes and systems may
seem like progress, but it limits bigger opportunities. This incompatibility
impedes a coordinated approach to customer engagement and
aÂ€unified view of operations.
Conservatives have a capability profile that is the opposite of
Fashionistas. Although Conservatives have useful digital leadership
What Is Digital Mastery? 17
capabilities, excess prudence prevents these firms from building strong
digital capabilities. Unconcerned about technology fashion, the
Â�companies focus on ensuring that every digital investment is carefully
considered and strongly coordinated. Leaders in these companies
don’t want to make mistakes that would waste their scarce time, effort,
and money. This caution can be useful, especially in highly regulated
industries such as health care and financial services. But it can also
create a governance trap that focuses more on controls and rules than
making progress. By focusing on control and certainty, Conservatives
find it hard to mobilize top management—and the rest of the organization—
to see the bigger prize that digital transformation can bring.
In trying to prevent failure, these companies fail to make much progress
at all.
DIGITAL MASTERY MATTERS
Digital Masters have overcome the difficulties that challenge their
competitors. They know how and where to invest, and their leaders are
committed to guiding the company powerfully into the digital future.
They are already exploiting their digital advantage to build superior
competitive positions in their industries.
To quantify the digital advantage, we conducted a survey of
391 companies in thirty countries.17 We limited the survey to large
Â�companies only—those with revenues of $500 million or higher. We
used statistical methods on specific questions in the survey to construct
factors representing subcomponents of the two dimensions of digital
mastery, to cluster the component factors, and then to make the two
dimensions as statistically independent of each other as possible. Then,
we split the sample at the median on each dimension to place each
company into one of the four categories, with each category containing
approximately 25 percent of the firms.
Next, we analyzed the financials of the 184 publicly traded firms in
our sample. We mean-adjusted the performance of each firm by subtracting
the average performance of all firms in its industry that were
18 LEADING DIGITAL
larger than $500 million in annual revenue. Then we compared the
average mean-adjusted performance of companies in each quadrant.
We found a striking performance difference for Digital Masters
(figure 1.2). The two critical elements of digital mastery—digital capabilities
and leadership capabilities—are associated with different types
of performance; companies that excel in a particular dimension outstrip
industry competitors in some performance measures while lagging
in others. Meanwhile, Digital Masters—companies that excel in both
dimensions—have the highest performance, far outstripping other
firms on multiple financial measures. Digital Masters are 26 percent
more profitable than their industry peers and generate 9 percent higher
revenue from their physical assets.18

Digital Capability and Revenue Generation
Companies with stronger digital capabilities are better at driving
revenue with their physical assets. On a basket of measures including
Â�revenue per employee and fixed-asset turnover, Fashionistas and
Digital Masters outperform average industry performance by 6 and
9Â€percent, respectively. Meanwhile, Beginners and Conservatives, both
of which lag in their digital capabilities, trail their industry competitors
by 4 and 10 percent, respectively.
These differences between high and low digital capability make
sense; digital activities can improve and extend the reach of physical
ones. With e-commerce, companies big and small now have access to
a global marketplace for their goods and services. Digital business can
help companies to manage more volume with a unit of existing physical
capacity. And digital capabilities can also help companies grow revenue
by reaching out to new customers or engaging with existing customers
in new ways. Nike’s ability to generate buzz through social media, or
Asian Paint’s use of call centers and mobile devices to leverage its salespeople,
helps these companies grow revenue without investing in more
employees or facilities.
The revenue-generation difference is substantial. For example,
Fashionistas—strong on digital investment but not on leadership—gain
16 percent more revenue per unit of human and physical assets than
Conservatives do, and 10 percent more than Beginners. Conservatives,
being weak on digital investment, have lower revenue leverage, but they
excel in other ways.
Leadership Capability and Profitability
Moving in the other dimension, companies that excel in leadership
capability are significantly more profitable than their peers. On average,
Conservatives and Digital Masters are, respectively, 9 and 26 percent
more profitable than their average industry competitors on a basket of
measures including EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin
20 LEADING DIGITAL
and net profit margin. Meanwhile, Beginners and Fashionistas, with
their weaker leadership capabilities, trail their average competitors by
11 and 24 percent, respectively, on these profitability measures.
For companies that excel at leadership capability, strong vision
and disciplined governance help drive digital investments in a common
direction. These firms weed out activities that run counter to the
future vision of the transformed firm. They scale successful investments
enterprise-wide. And they engage their employees in identifying valuable
new opportunities.
Asian Paints built on efficiencies it gained through strong governance
and IT–business relationships to launch new digital Â�capabilities
that moved the company into the Digital Master category. Nike’s
digital unit develops digital products and capabilities, helps other
units, and manages digital activities that cut across organizational
silos. Each firm found that strong digital leadership created efficiency
and scalability in its digital efforts.
THE PERFORMANC E ADVANTAGE
OF DIGITAL MASTERS
Firms that excel in either dimension outperform their competitors in
specific and different ways. Digital Masters—firms that excel in both
dimensions—far outperform the others. On average, Digital Masters
are 26 percent more profitable than their industry competitors. They
generate 9 percent more revenue with their employees and physical
assets. For the large, traditional companies we studied—with revenues
of $500 million or larger—the difference can be many millions of dollars
on the bottom line.
Digital Masters combine digital capabilities and leadership capabilities
to achieve performance that is greater than either dimension
can deliver on its own. Strong digital capabilities make new digital
initiatives easier and less risky, while providing revenue leverage that
can generate new cash. Meanwhile, strong leadership creates synergies
that free up money for investment, while also engaging employees
What Is Digital Mastery? 21
to identify new opportunities. Together, the two capabilities spiral in
aÂ€virtuous cycle of ever-increasing digital advantage.
Our analysis shows correlation, not causality. Excelling in digital
capability and leadership capability may lead to higher financial
performance for the firm. On the other hand, we may be seeing that
companies that outperform their peers financially tend to excel in
the two dimensions of digital mastery. The direction of causality is
important from an academic research standpoint. But from a management
standpoint, either direction of causality leads to the same
advice.
So, let’s say it this way: the best-managed companies in the
world—those that significantly outperform their peers in both revenue
generation and profitability—tend to manage their digital activities
in a common way. They build both digital capabilities and leadership
capabilities that are better than other companies. If the best-managed
Â�companies in the world do digital this way, then it’s a good idea to
manage your digital activities this way too.
DO YOU HAVE TIME TO WAIT ?
Digital transformation is moving much more rapidly in some
Â�industries than in others. If you are in the travel or publishing
Â�industries, you have been dealing with digital competitors and digital
sales for years. But what if you are in an industry like pharmaceuticals
or utilities, where strong digital threats have yet to materialize? Can
you afford to wait?
Figure 1.3 shows digital mastery, by industry, for our survey. Each
dot represents the average mastery of companies in each industry for
which we have twenty or more data points. Some industries are already
squarely in the Digital Masters quadrant, while others still lag. Many
firms in the high-tech industry are already Digital Masters, while digital
mastery in pharmaceuticals is far lower. Other industries, such as
telecom or consumer packaged goods, are on the cusp of digital mastery,
but need more digital or leadership capabilities, or both, to get there.

Figure 1.3
Digital mastery by industry
If your company is trailing your industry’s average digital mastery,
then you need to get moving fast. But what if you are not behind in
your industry? If you are an executive in a Beginner industry, such as
consumer packaged goods, pharmaceuticals, or manufacturing, you
might be tempted to believe you can wait. After all, why invest the cost
and effort to become a Digital Master if your whole industry is lagging?
This kind of thinking is sensible. And it’s wrong.
You might think that if your industry is not in the Digital Master
quadrant, then you have an opportunity to grab digital advantage before
anybody else does. Such thinking is a bit more accurate, but still wrong.
You might even think that you can watch your competitors and be
a fast follower. This attitude, too, is not quite right. It’s too late to beat
all of your peers to the punch, and you can’t be a fast follower in digital
mastery unless you are already there.
What Is Digital Mastery? 23
If you are not a Digital Master, figure 1.4 has bad news. It shows,
for each industry, the percentage of firms in each quadrant. In most
industries, more than one-fourth of all large firms are already Digital
Masters. Even more important is this: every industry already hosts
at least one Digital Master. In other words, in every industry—from
pharma to manufacturing to high-tech—some company is already
reaping the benefits of the digital advantage. Every other company is
behind.
This situation should be a call to action. Think about it. Even if
it only takes you three or four years to become a Digital Master, some
firms in your industry are already enjoying a digital advantage. Even
worse, while you start to build the capabilities you need, the masters
can exploit the capabilities they already have. These companies can
accelerate ahead of you even as you try to catch up.

24 LEADING DIGITAL
HOW TO GET STARTED NO W
Digital mastery matters. It matters in every industry. We’ve found that
the DNA of Digital Masters is clear, and any company can adopt it. But
it takes time to become a Digital Master, and time is a fast-Â�diminishing
commodity for many firms.
How will you become a Digital Master? Companies take different
paths to get there. Nike was a Fashionista before it became a
Digital Master. Initially, it developed digital capabilities in silos. Then,
through its Nike Digital Sport unit, it added new leadership capabilities
to link the silos and launch new digital capabilities.
Asian Paints went the other way; it was a Conservative before it
became a Digital Master. Executives in Asian Paints created the vision
to become a more unified company and then built governance and
IT capabilities to help it get there. Then they repeatedly built on the
company’s capabilities to transform its customer engagement, internal
operations, and business models. Both Asian Paints and Nike are reaping
huge benefits from their digital mastery.
Although it is less common, some companies have made the
leap directly from Beginner to Digital Master. They did not stop in
between. Burberry, which we’ll discuss in chapter 2, did it. And while
making a direct leap is difficult and risky, sometimes it is the only way
forward. This is especially true if you have a crisis situation—a “Â�burning
Â�platform” such as in media, entertainment, or information services; in
this case making the leap may be the best way out.
Figure 1.5 shows the four quadrants of digital mastery in more detail,
including challenges that each quadrant can face. Take a minute to think
about it. What quadrant is your company in? Decide for yourself, and
then ask some colleagues. Are your digital efforts creating real change
in your company, or are they just shiny baubles? Are you being too careful
and thus missing the digital opportunity? The self-Â�assessment in the
appendix can help you identify your position in the matrix.
If your firm is a Fashionista, you should start to build leadership
capabilities and gain synergies across your digital efforts.

your company. You may want to hire a chief digital officer like Starbucks
did or create a digital unit like Nike did. Moving from Fashionista to
Digital Master may require some investment as you refocus disconnected
digital initiatives and technologies into a unified and coherent
digital program. This kind of refocusing and rework, however painful
in the short term, will pay off later in terms of lower costs, lower risk,
and greater agility.
If your firm is a Conservative, you can take advantage of your
digital leadership strengths to build new digital capabilities in a smart
way. Every company has areas that executives know they can improve,
whether in customer engagement or internal operations. Try some
experiments to address these issues. Then scale the successful trials to
enterprise level. Like the executives at Asian Paints, you can continually
think about how to expand your digital vision. What else can you
26 LEADING DIGITAL
do with your new digital capabilities? Engage your employees, through
meetings or innovation contests, to identify new digital opportunities.
Then implement.
If your firm is a Beginner, you can try some experiments to test
the digital waters, either with customers or in your internal operations.
Then build a vision of your digital future and start to create the capabilities
to make it happen. Often the best course is to start with the
capability that is most natural for your company. Then you can move
in the more challenging direction once you are ready. Insurers and
banks could leverage their conservative cultures to build committed
Â�leadership capabilities first, and then expand their digital investments.
Fast-moving, customer-focused industries such as fashion or media
could start by innovating new digital capabilities and then building
strong leadership capabilities.
WHAT’S NEXT
You’ve seen the benefits of being a Digital Master. You’ve started to
think about your level of digital mastery. Now it’s time to plot your digital
transformation strategy. In the rest of the book, we’ll show you how.
Part I shows, in depth, what it means to build your digital capabilities.
Our research has identified three broad areas in which companies
are building new digital capabilities—customer experience, operational
processes, and business models. We thus devote a chapter to each area,
including examples from many companies around the world such as
Air France, Burberry, Caesars Entertainment, and Codelco. Part
II shows how to build your leadership capabilities. We’ve identified
four elements: shared transformative vision, strong governance, deep
engagement, and solid technology leadership. We devote a chapter to
each element, including examples of how companies such as Caesars,
Codelco, P&G, Pages Jaunes, and Starbucks are making it happen.
Then, part III helps you build your roadmap. We provide concrete
management guidance—plus self-assessments you can complete with
your colleagues—to help you create your own digital advantage.
PART I
BUILDING DIGITAL
CAPABILITIES
The DNA of Digital Masters is clear. One element of the DNA
shows that digital transformation cannot happen without astute
digital investments—the what of digital transformation. But
too many companies confuse digital advantage with the digital technologies
themselves. Digital Masters focus on making their businesses
different through technology, not on the technologies themselves.
Part I shows, in depth, how executives have transformed the way
their companies operate. You can differentiate your company through
three broad categories of digital capability: customer experience, operational
processes, and business models. Let’s look at each in turn.

cHAPtEr 2
CREATING A COMPELLING
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
one of the deep secrets of life is that all that is
really worth doing is what we do for others.
—Lewis Carroll
Transforming the customer experience is at the heart of digital transformation.
Digital technologies are changing the game of customer
interactions, with new rules and possibilities that were unimaginable
only a few years back.
Do you want to finally hear the voice of your customers and escape
the narrow lenses of surveys and focus groups? Social media let you. Do
you want your clients to continue their engagement with your brand
on the move? Mobile computing lets you. Do you want to know where
your customers physically are? Geolocalization lets you. Do you want
to make better predictions to deliver a truly personalized experience?
Customer analytics lets you.
For Digital Masters, these new technologies are not goals to attain
or signals to send to investors. Instead, the technologies are tools that
can be combined to get closer to customers. Digital mastery goes well
30 LEADING DIGITAL
beyond websites and mobile apps to truly transform the customer
Â�experience and how you steer customers effortlessly through it.
Delivered properly, an engaging customer experience creates value
for both customers and firms. It drives retention and stimulates customer
loyalty. But delivering a differentiated customer experience in
large organizations is a complex task. Why? First, customer expectations
have increased substantially; of the 150 executives we interviewed
early in our study, 70 percent highlighted the ever-rising tide of customer
expectations as a key driver for change.1 Second, integrating new
digital channels into existing operations can be organizationally challenging.
Third, these digital interactions force an evolution in culture—
new clock speed, new decision-making methods, new rules—that can
run counter to the way large traditional companies have managed
customer relationships. So, like our Beginners or Conservatives, you
can choose to do only a few experiments here and there. Or, like our
Fashionistas, you can invest in every new shiny object that’s available.
But you would be missing the big prize.
Despite the challenges, huge benefits are available to those companies
that create compelling customer experiences.
LEADING THE DIGITAL REBIRTH
OF AN OLD ICONIC BRAND
In 2006, when Angela Ahrendts took the helm at Burberry, the company’s
top-line growth was significantly behind its peers.2 While the
overall sector was growing at around 12 to 13 percent a year, Burberry’s
growth was only 1 to 2 percent. The company was not keeping pace
with the rapid development in the luxury goods market, neither in terms
of innovation nor in terms of products and services. Burberry was up
against tough competition from much larger French and Italian peers,
each of which had multiple brands and many times the company’s own
revenue and profit. Something had to be done to reverse this trend.
Burberry’s management team began by asking itself a fundamental
question: “What is our vision?” From there, the team members began
Creating a Compelling Customer Experience 31
the development of a five-year strategy-making process looking at
Burberry’s unique assets and strategic direction. Ahrendts explained:
“What do we have that our peers don’t? First, we’re British. Second, we
were born from a coat. Finally, our peers were all targeting ‘ladies who
lunch’ and focusing mainly on the baby boomers. There was no way we
could meet them head on with their much larger advertising budgets.
We decided to go after the millennial customers.”3
This last strategic choice proved critical to Burberry’s digital
Â�journey. The company decided to target its marketing spending on
millennial consumers—those in their twenties. They chose to focus on
emerging economies, where the average high-net-worth customer is
typically fifteen years younger than in traditional markets. To engage
and communicate effectively with this population, Burberry had to
use millennials’ mother tongue: digital. That’s when the digital vision
became reality and the digital transformation started for Burberry.
Ahrendts identified that, to be successful, there had to be a pure,
global brand vision. Christopher Bailey, the digital-savvy chief creative
officer, became the “brand czar,” meaning anything that the customer
sees goes through his office. Working together, Ahrendts and Bailey
communicated this vision internally. Ahrendts explained: “We said we
would no longer do what was best for a person or what was best for a
region. We would do what was best for the brand. We talked about the
‘digital tsunami’ coming, and used this to drive home why and where
we needed to focus, and how united and pure our global brand expression
had to be.”4
With the top team aligned around this new vision, Ahrendts and
Bailey decided to focus on digital marketing to target their customers.
They hired a young, dynamic marketing team whose members mirrored
the millennial customer. The company allocated a substantial
portion of its annual marketing budget to digital media, shifting away
from traditional media.
The company has excelled in digital marketing, launching several
successful and innovative initiatives: revamping Burberry.com in eleven
languages;5 launching a fragrance with innovative Facebook sampling;
32 LEADING DIGITAL
developing Tweetwalk, live-stream fashion shows, with Twitter;
Â�collaborating with Google to create Burberry Kisses, allowing users to
capture and send their “kiss” to anyone in the world;6 and partnering
with Chinese social media platform WeChat in the autumn/winter
2014 runway show to launch a series of mobile content experiences.
Empowered by a closely connected, creative thinking culture, the company
used digital technologies to share the excitement of key brand
moments with its worldwide customers.
At the same time, Burberry’s retail investment was keeping pace—
opening twenty to thirty new stores a year. How could the company use
digital innovation to engage its customers seamlessly in its physical real
estate as well as online? This is where Burberry’s retail-theater concept
came into play. Ahrendts explained: “We began to partner with technology
companies to make the ‘retail theater’ concept real, enabling us
to broadcast our multifaceted content to our stores globally. We used
technology to bring our brand to life in our stores: from the music to
the rich video content on giant internal and external screens to the
iPads carried by all sales associates that gave access to the full global
collection regardless of what was available in-store. We invited our customers
to watch our runway shows live in stores and enabled them to
shop the collection on iPads immediately afterwards for delivery in six
to eight weeks. In this way, we have developed our stores to showcase
our digital innovations.”7
Prior to this wave of digital innovations, Burberry had spent several
years implementing a backbone enterprise platform to consolidate its
systems and make its global operations transparent. It was critical for
the company to have a single view of the customer in order to improve
the experience across all channels, media, and platforms. “Had we not
put that in place,” Ahrendts said, “we would not have been able to do
so much of the front-end digital innovation we have been doing.”8 The
company also made big investments in customer service not only by
training salespeople in stores, but also on its website, where customers
can click to call or click to chat with customer service representatives
365 days a year, 24/7, and in fourteen languages.9
Creating a Compelling Customer Experience 33
Burberry’s next challenge was analytics. The company layered on
new communication and analytics tools. It promoted a chief customer
officer to optimize insights from all physical and digital interactions. It
launched a “Customer 360” program—a data-driven shopping experience
that invites customers to digitally share their buying histories,
shopping tendencies, and fashion preferences—to allow Burberry to
profile and personalize the experience. Retail assistants can access customers’
digital profiles through tablets, knowing, for example, what a
Brazilian customer last bought on a stopover to Paris and what she said
about Burberry on Twitter.10
According to Ahrendts, “Our vision was that any person, any
Â�constituency, needing to interact with Burberry would come to
Burberry.com and enjoy exactly the same experience as in-store
Â�customers. We wanted them to come into our world—Burberry
World—and be able to visit all the different parts of the business as
they would do in our HQ.”11
Today, more people see the Burberry brand via digital than they do
through any other medium. In luxury, 60 percent of people shop online
and pick up in a store. As Ahrendts pointed out, “If the store doesn’t
look or feel the same as it does online, are you truly behaving like a
great brand?” In 2013–2014 Burberry was named by think tank L2 as
the fashion brand with the number one “digital IQ” for the second year
running, included in Fast Company’s list of the top ten most innovative
retail companies globally for the second consecutive year, and named
one of Interbrand’s best global brands for the fifth consecutive year.12
WHAT DO DIGITAL MASTERS
DO DIFFERENTLY?
Burberry is an outstanding example of a company that blurs the lines
between its digital and physical customer experiences. It is not an isolated
case. Our research shows that Digital Masters transform their
customer experiences through the sum of four related interventions.
Together, these interventions fundamentally change the customer
34 LEADING DIGITAL
value equation. First, Digital Masters spend time understanding
Â�customer behavior and designing the customer experience from the outside
in. A Digital Master figures out what customers do and why, where,
and how they do it. The company then works out where and how the
experience can be digitally enhanced across channels.
Second, Digital Masters use digital technologies to increase reach
and engagement through smart investments in new digital channels.
They provide user-friendly mobile apps, develop rewarding social
media experiences, and rebalance their marketing spending to reinforce
the engagement.
Third, they put customer data at the heart of the whole customer experience.
They become more scientific, using metrics and analytics to inform
the change—everything from understanding current usage of their products
and services to segmenting the customer base and proactively offering
personalized deals and designing predictive marketing campaigns.
Finally, Digital Masters work to seamlessly mesh the physical and
digital experiences, not by replacing the old with the new, but by using
digital technologies to enhance the customer experience by leveraging
valuable existing assets.
DESIGNING THE CUSTOMER
EXPERIENCE FROM THE OUTSIDE IN
Designing a good experience is, of course, based on a clear vision of
what you are trying to achieve. As Gary Loveman, CEO of global gaming
company Caesars Entertainment, pointed out, “The experience has
to be what our customers want it to be.”13
Digitally engaged customers expect that products, services, and
information will be timely and tailored to their specific needs. They
want all of these at the precise moment they are looking, and on whatever
platform they are using at the time. The more touch points you
have, the greater the complexity of the interactions across channels
and the greater the need to understand them in detail. So how can you
define the kind of engaging experience your customers really want?
Creating a Compelling Customer Experience 35
You need to thoroughly understand both customer behaviors and the
organizational requirements to deliver the new customer experience.
Take the time to systematically learn how people interact with your
products, services, channels, brand, infrastructure, and Â�employees—
deep insights into customer decisions and usage journeys. How do
customers behave before, during, and after an interaction with your
company? Where are the pain points? How can you alleviate them?
What part of the experience can be digitally enhanced? Which customers
are more prone to engage digitally, and how?
Joe Gross, head of group market management at insurance group
Allianz, pointed out: “We started by identifying touch points that
Â�digital impacted, and of course, these touch points spanned the entire
spectrum of the value chain—right from the customer-awareness stage
to distribution to actual sales, product offers to pricing, et cetera. Once
we identified these touch points, we devised assessment criteria against
each of them.”14
Adam Brotman, chief digital officer at Starbucks, adopted a similar
approach. “We tend to look at what are the needs of our customers,
what’s the strategy of our business, what are all the different digital
touch points that are already in place versus ones we need to put in
place, and then we’ll roadmap out how we want to prioritize our time
and effort against this backdrop.”15
Behaviors across large customer bases are rarely homogeneous.
Data and analytics should inform the segmentation of your customer
base, defining targeted experiences according to specific behavior patterns.
Burberry, for example, understood early that high-net-worth
millennial consumers in emerging markets would require a different,
digital-rich, experience than would traditional fashion consumers.
Similarly, Kirsten Lynch, chief marketing officer of Vail Resorts,
realized that to improve the customers’ experience, she had to get a
more granular understanding of skiers’ behavior: “For years we’ve had
a CRM [customer relationship management] system that gives us
basic demographic and behavioral data .Â€.Â€. Skiing is such a passionbased
business that we need to go beyond basic data to understand why
36 LEADING DIGITAL
our guests come to the mountain.”16 She decided to use personae to
Â�segment her customer base.17 “We have the ‘Alpine A-Listers,’ who
are hard-core about skiing and also passionate about the luxury experience,”
she said. “Then there are ‘Village Sophisticates,’ who tend to
care more about dining, shopping and spas than skiing. The ‘Shred
Heads’ care only about making the most of their ski day—it’s not about
luxury for them. For each segment, we know how many days they ski
a year, where they ski and what they spend their money on. We can
personalize what we talk to them about .Â€.Â€. We are piloting some new
technology that pre-populates the agent’s screen with everything we
know about our guests.”18
You also need to focus on delivery from the start. How big is your
organizational challenge? What process, people, and technology changes
are required to make the new customer experience work? What power
needs to be in the hands of customers so they can use whichever technology
they prefer to reach your company? For instance, self-service facilities
can be used to track a package delivery, configure a complex industrial
product online, or know precisely when a pizza will be delivered.
Unfortunately, too few companies do what it takes to succeed.
Forrester Research reports that although 86 percent of customer-Â�
experience executives believe that customer experience is a top strategic
priority, less than half of the companies have a companywide program
to address it, and only 30 percent have a dedicated budget to fund the
change required.19
Digital Masters do it right; they invest in designing a compelling
customer experience from the outside in. They are also prepared to do
what it takes to adapt the organization to deliver on the promise.
CREATING REACH AND
CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT
Digital transformation cannot happen without digital investment.
Digital Masters make smart digital investments to creatively enhance
customer experiences. The size of the investment is not important,
Creating a Compelling Customer Experience 37
but the impact is. To these companies, new technologies such as social
media, mobility, and analytics are only tools to get closer to their
customers.
Since opening its first location in Seattle in 1971, Starbucks has
grown into one of the world’s most globally recognized brands.
Starbucks has built a multi-billion-dollar enterprise on more than just
coffee; it has succeeded in creating a unique “Starbucks experience”
in its stores and online. But Starbucks has not always been a Digital
Master.
Following a rapid expansion, Starbucks faced declining samestore
sales in 2008, and its share price had been cut nearly in half over
the prior two years. The picture wasn’t much better on the technology
front. Unintuitive point-of-sale systems still ran on antiquated technology,
and store managers had no access to e-mail. To turn the tide,
senior leaders, under the helm of CEO Howard Schultz, took a number
of strategic actions, key among them using digital Â�technologies to
engage customers in new ways. Adam Brotman, the company’s chief
digital officer, explained: “Digital for Starbucks was not just about
a website or a point-of-sales system, but about an ability to connect
with customers and transform their experience and drive the company.”
20 The company decided to lead the way with mobile and social
channels.
The first Starbucks foray into mobile was the company’s myStarbucks
app, released in 2009, which allowed customers to locate the
nearest store, learn more about the company’s coffees, and even build
their own drinks. In January 2011, Starbucks took its loyalty program
digital with the introduction of its Starbucks Card mobile app. This app
allowed Starbucks customers to pay for in-store purchases with their
mobile phones. App users could present an on-screen version of their
prepaid loyalty card and could top up their funds online, on their smartphones,
or in stores. This approach integrated easily with existing pointof-
sale technology, which was already set up for reading bar codes. Since
its launch, the program has been extremely successful, with 20 percent
of all loyalty card transactions conducted via mobile in 2012.21
38 LEADING DIGITAL
Keeping pace with advances in mobile technology, Starbucks
has continued to expand its mobile payment capabilities. In 2012, it
announced that customers would be able to make payments at the register
via Square—an app-based mobile payment system—following a
$25 million investment in the service.22 Starbucks has also enabled integration
of its application with Apple’s native Passbook feature, which
consolidates ticket, coupon, and loyalty card information on an iPhone
or iPod Touch for convenient access.
Mobile payments at Starbucks have been a success for customer
convenience, but they are proving to have financial benefits as well.
Processing fees for transactions through its mobile app and Square have
been substantially reduced. With over three million mobile Â�payment
transactions per week in 2012, the mobile-payments introduction has
significantly reduced transaction fees.23 The reduction benefits both
coffee drinkers and Starbucks.
Starbucks has also built a leading presence in social media. By 2012,
the company’s 54 million Facebook fans, 3.4 million Twitter followers,
and 900,000 followers on Instagram earned Starbucks a number one
ranking among socially engaged companies.
Digital Masters like Starbucks do not just invest smartly in technology
and channels. They maximize these investments by optimizing
their marketing media mix. Burberry took the plunge by redirecting
a substantial portion of its annual marketing budget to digital media.
Procter & Gamble, the consumer products giant, is investing almost a
third of its media spending on digital, social, and mobile.24 Not a small
decision from one of the world’s biggest advertisers! Not all companies
have to be that bold. Research firm Gartner estimated that on average,
large US companies spend about 25 percent of their marketing budgets
on digital.25 Whatever the amount, a rebalancing is needed if a firm is
to get full benefits from the increased channel reach.
The social media presence of Starbucks has earned the company
more than just fans. The company also uses social media to fuel
customer-driven innovation. Through its My Starbucks Idea site,
Starbucks has collected more than 150,000 customer-submitted ideas to
Creating a Compelling Customer Experience 39
improve its products, customer experience, and corporate Â�initiatives.26
Once an idea has been submitted, the site’s customer community can
vote the idea up or down, helping Starbucks identify and implement
the best ideas. The company closes the loop with its Ideas in Action
blog, where employees respond to ideas personally, and it lets customers
know when they can expect to see their ideas realized in stores. For
example, one community member suggested making it easier for customers
to manage multiple orders—especially useful for people going
on midday Starbucks runs for their coworkers. In less than a month,
Starbucks introduced its Runner Reward program. The program provides
runners with a convenient form to manage orders and offers them
a fifth drink (their own drink) free of charge.27
Brotman summed it up: “Everything we are doing in digital is about
enhancing and strengthening those connections [with our customers]
in only the way that digital can and only the way that Starbucks can.”28
PUTTING CUSTOMER DATA AT THE
HEART OF THE EXPERIENCE
The digitization of just about everything we do or use these days has
created a deluge of information. Executives now have access to precious
data that can substantially increase their insights into the customer
experience. Data should be the lifeblood for designing compelling customer
experiences. By adding science to the art, data helps companies
move from guesswork to inspired predictions and continuous hypotheses
testing.
Digital Masters rely heavily on data-driven insights. But making
your customer experience more scientific requires difficult organizational
learning. CEO Gary Loveman of Caesars explained: “When
I showed up at Caesars, we were collecting a tremendous amount of
transactional data about our customers who were anxious for us to do
something useful with it. And we couldn’t figure out how to do that.
The organization had a loyalty program that collected a bunch of information
so that we could give customers certain things in return for their
40 LEADING DIGITAL
business, like free meals and hotel rooms and the like. But we couldn’t
figure out how first to architect the data in a constructive fashion and
then apply analytics against it that would allow us to get a guy named
X to make an incremental visit under certain conditions and someone
named Y to make a different visit under different circumstances.”29
Today, the picture at Caesars is different. The company collects
vast amounts of transactional, demographic, and game-play data
through its loyalty program to create a detailed profile for each Caesars
guest. Employees then use this information throughout the company
to make better customer decisions.
For example, Caesars marketers can create and target special offers
with precision. Meanwhile, the hospitality staff can use the same information
to personalize nearly every aspect of a guest’s stay, from how
he or she is greeted on arrival, to how the room is made up. Should a
guest have an unlucky evening at the casino, managers on the floor can
even perform a cost-benefit analysis and offer complimentary services
to improve the experience.
While it is common across the industry to lavish this kind of personalized
attention on big spenders (or whales, in industry parlance),
most casino-goers receive a relatively undifferentiated experience. The
Caesars data-driven approach, on the other hand, allows the company
to scale its personalized touch to a far larger group of customers. Gary
Loveman said, “You can’t just fail to service the tens of millions of people
that constitute the middle of the market.”30
Mobility and location-based data also play a key role in driving
customer intelligence at Caesars. A customer’s mobile experience
begins before he or she even walks through the door. Before arriving
at one of the forty Caesars properties, guests who have opted into the
company’s Texpress service can check in via SMS (short messaging
service, or texting). This service enables them to bypass registration
lines and pick up their keys at the bell desk. Texpress also combines
mobile location data and SMS to deliver timely and relevant special
offers. “If you’re at Paris, we could send you two free admissions to the
Creating a Compelling Customer Experience 41
Eiffel Tower ride or if you’re at Caesars Palace after 6 p.m., we could
send you an offer for the Bette Midler show,” explained a member of
the Caesars Â�marketing team. “We might have some additional show
tickets left over, so knowing where the customer is, is a great way to get
those tickets pushed.”31
The digital world has multiplied the sources and volume of data
available to corporations. There is a need to harness the wealth of
structured and unstructured data from usage and social media. What’s
more, the data can be enriched when it is meshed with location-based
data from mobile devices. The key is your ability to integrate this data
to make better decisions, increase the quality of the personalized experience,
and create true competitive advantage.
US financial institution Capital One is known for its sustained
growth in the credit card market. At the heart of its performance is an
advanced data analytics capability. Capital One employs both internal
and external data to effectively segment the market for credit cards.
The company’s Card Lab gives direct insight into every user’s
individual preferences. The lab’s users have the freedom to modify the
visual appearance of their card, and to select from a combination of
rewards, interest rates, and fees.32 With its acquisition of data aggregator
Bundle Corp, Capital One can track usage data from more than
twenty million Visa and MasterCard branded cards.33 In addition, the
company has been able to combine banking services with coupons.34
Capital One helps consumers get the best mobile-payment offers
based on their geographical location and purchase history. And, of
course, all this data mining helps Capital One understand consumers
better.
With this mass of data, Capital One gets very granular insights
into individual consumer preferences. But the story goes further. With
its Digital Innovation Lab, Capital One continually finds innovative
ways to use these consumer insights to improve the customer experience.
35 The company analyzes up to sixty thousand different product
configurations every year and follows through on the most promising.36
42 LEADING DIGITAL
TheÂ€digital contact centers can use the insights to predict requirements
better, thus providing better customer support.
Capital One’s strategy has improved its financial performance.
Its net profit grew at a compound annual growth rate of 19.3 percent
between 2000 and 2010. And Capital One has continued to thrive after
the financial crisis of 2009, achieving 10.7 percent growth from 2010
to 2013.37
As the preceding examples show, the culture of Digital Masters is
rooted in a common pursuit. Whether drawing on insights from demographic,
mobile, or social media data, or good old-fashioned attention
to detail, Digital Masters use information and advanced analytics to
deliver a superior customer experience.
SEAMLESSLY MESHING PHYSICAL AND
DIGITAL EXPERIENCES IN NEW WAYS
Companies with multiple channels to customers—physical, phone,
mail, social, mobile, and so on—are experiencing pressure to provide
an integrated experience. Delivering these omni-channel experiences
requires envisioning and implementing change across both front-end
and operational processes. Innovation does not come from opposing
the old and the new. But as Burberry has shown, innovation comes
from creatively meshing the digital and the physical to reinvent new and
compelling customer experiences and to foster continuous innovation.
Similarly, the unique Starbucks experience is rooted in connecting
with customers in engaging ways. But Starbucks does not stop with
the physical store. It has digitally enriched the customer experience by
bridging its local, in-store experience with attractive new online possibilities.
Delivered via a free Wi-Fi connection, the Starbucks Digital
Network offers in-store customers premium digital content, such as the
New York Times or The Economist, to enjoy alongside their coffee. The
network also offers access to local content, from free local restaurant
reviews from Zagat to check-in via Foursquare.38
Creating a Compelling Customer Experience 43
Combining physical and digital to enhance customer experiences
is not limited to just commercial enterprises. Public services are getting
on the act. The Cleveland Museum of Art is using technology
to enhance the experience and the engagement of visitors. “EVERY
museum is searching for this holy grail, this blending of technology and
art,” said David Franklin, the director of the museum.39
Forty-foot-wide touch screens display greeting-card-sized images
of all three thousand objects on display in the museum. Visitors touch
an image; the screen enlarges it, arranges itself near similarly themed
objects, and offers information like the location of the actual piece. By
touching an icon on the image, visitors can transfer it from the wall to
an iPad (their own, or rented from the museum for $5 a day), creating
a personal list of favorites. From this list, visitors can design a personalized
tour, which they can share with others.
“There is only so much information you can put on a wall, and no
one walks around with catalogs anymore,” Franklin said. The app can
produce a photo of the artwork’s original setting—seeing a tapestry in
a room filled with tapestries, rather than in a white-walled gallery, is
more interesting. Another feature lets you take the elements of a large
tapestry and rearrange them in either comic-book or movie-trailer
Â�format. The experience becomes fun, educational, and engaging. This
reinvention has lured new technology-savvy visitors, but has also made
seasoned museum-goers come more often.
FACING A TALL ORDER FOR
TRADITIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
This digital age has both informed and amplified customer expectations.
In the last few years, many digital-savvy companies have set a high bar.
Whether you are e-hailing a taxi through a mobile app or buying personalized
insurance for your pet online, it’s simple, it works, it meets
your personal needs, and it can even be a pleasurable experience. And the
expectation gap is increasing. A study by Harris Interactive found that
44 LEADING DIGITAL
89 percent of consumers in 2011 quit doing business with a company
because of a bad customer experience, up from 68 percent in 2006.40
Customers don’t separate their online experiences from their
Â�physical experiences. They see products and services as a whole; they
search for objective advice and compare. They want to engage with
brands that care, and they share feedback openly—good or bad.
Forrester Research found that a quarter of American consumers who
had unsatisfactory service interactions in 2010 shared their experiences
through social networks, a 50 percent increase over 2009.41
Unfortunately, there is no indication that these rising expectations will
slow down anytime soon. Get prepared.
Creating a compelling customer experience is one of the key pillars
of digital transformation. Opportunities abound, but getting it
right is organizationally complex. It takes a thorough understanding
of customer behavior, smart channel investments, a grasp of customer
data, and creativity in blending the old and the new. As we will show
in part II, it takes strong operational capabilities and great IT systems.
And it takes strong vision and leadership to create organizational
change. Whatever stands in the way of delivering a compelling
customer experience, fix it. In the long run, doing so will contribute
to delivering good performance and changing your company culture
from the inside.
In the next chapter, we’ll show how Digital Masters create the
right kinds of operational capabilities to increase efficiency, flexibility,
and customer satisfaction. Later, in part II, we will describe how
to build the right leadership capabilities so that you, like Burberry,
can transform your customer experience, and your company as a
whole.

CHAPTER 3
EXPLOITING THE POWER
OF CORE OPERATIONS
What lies behind you, and what lies in front of you,
pales in comparison to what lies inside of you.
—Ralph Waldo Emerson
Codelco, the world’s largest copper producer, did not choose customer
experience as the focus of its digital transformation. It looked inward,
transforming its operational processes to increase both its efficiency
and its innovativeness.1 The company, which is owned by the government
of Chile, employs nearly eighteen thousand people and produces
10 percent of the world’s copper. In 2012, it produced 1.8 million metric
tons of copper, generating $15.9 billion in revenue.2
Mining can be a dirty, dangerous, and labor-intensive process.
Coordination is difficult because up-to-date information is often only
available where the work is happening, whether it is underground with
miners, on trucks that move around the mines, or at the machines that
process copper ore. Facing challenges around mining productivity,
worker safety, and environmental protection, Codelco’s executive team
took a hard, strategic look at what the future could bring. The team
48 LEADING DIGITAL
wanted to transform mining operations, moving from a physical model
to one powered by digital technology.
To turn that vision into reality, executives initiated Codelco Digital.
The initiative’s goal was to drive radical improvements in mining automation
and to support executives in developing, communicating, and
evolving a long-term digital vision. CIO Marco Orellana, the leader of
Codelco Digital, worked with the executive team, employees, vendors,
industry partners, and sometimes even Codelco’s competitors, to innovate
operational processes. He said, “Our business in the past was related
to physical labor, and today our business is more related to knowledge
and technology .Â€.Â€. We introduced new innovations, new ways of working,
and new ways of relating with the people inside the mines.”3
After improving its internal administrative systems, the company
shifted focus to transforming the mining process. The first step was to
implement real-time mining, that is, a comprehensive real-time view
of operations with the goal of improving operational performance.4 In
four mines, experts in a centralized operations center coordinate activity
remotely, using data feeds from different parts of the mines. Operators
capture and share information in real time to tune their operations and
to adjust production schedules as needed.
These advances set the stage for more radical change. Immense
mining trucks now drive autonomously, arriving at their destinations on
time and with fewer accidents than human drivers. The lessons learned
from building autonomous trucks have led to autonomous mining
machinery. And work processes are changing to take advantage of the
possibilities that mobile technology, analytics, and embedded devices
make possible. Already, according to Orellana, many workers “don’t
travel to the mines. They travel to the [control center in the] city .Â€.Â€.
they apply their knowledge, not their physical strength.”5
The transformation continues, leading to even more radical
changes in Codelco’s operations. Integrated information networks and
fully automated processes will let the company design future mines differently.
The company is moving toward an intelligent-mining model,
where no miner may ever need to work in the dangerous underground
Exploiting the Power of Core Operations 49
environment again. Intelligent mining is an important goal, especially
after 2010, when thirty-three miners from a different mining company
were trapped underground for sixty-eight days.6 Fully autonomous
machines, connected through a wide information network, will operate
twenty-four hours per day, while being controlled remotely from the
central control center.7
But the benefits of digitally transforming mining operations go
far beyond safety. Removing humans from underground mines will
allow Codelco to design mines to different specifications. After all, if
a tunnel collapses on a person, it’s a terrible tragedy. But if it collapses
on a driverless truck, it’s not so bad. Human-free mining designs are
cheaper and faster to build, with implications for the economics of the
company. If Codelco can dig more cheaply and with lower risk, it can
exploit huge caches of ore that are not economically feasible today.
What started as better process information and driverless trucks is now
changing the economics of the entire company.
At the same time that Codelco is automating processes and removing
humans from dangerous locations, the company is engaging
employees far differently from before. CIO Orellana said, “Our company
is very conservative, so changing the culture is a key challenge.”8
Leaders are working to speed execution, become more data-driven in
decision making, and increase the firm’s innovativeness. According
to Orellana, “We created internal innovation awards to promote new
ideas and encourage our workers to innovate.” When workers create
an innovation in one mine, Codelco publicizes the innovation, and the
workers, across the company.
While not immune to the union-versus-management challenges
common in many mining companies, Codelco’s managers and workers
are joining together to identify and implement digital opportunities.
“We needed more safety conditions for the workers,” Orellana said,
“and we needed to create a more attractive business for the new workers
who don’t like working inside the mines and inside the tunnels.”9
Codelco executives are now reaching for new frontiers through
model-driven management in mining. Instead of making decisions
50 LEADING DIGITAL
based on past results, they are moving to real-time predictive management.
According to Orellana, “This is very challenging because the
tools as we know them today, such as ERP, must be adjusted to collect,
process, and deploy this new information. We are sure that this ability
will become a competitive advantage, allowing us to be even more productive
and more efficient than we are today.”
Digital transformation is already paying huge dividends at Codelco.
Operational efficiency and safety are increasing steadily. The firm is
extending the life of older mines and identifying new opportunities. It
is working with vendors from inside and outside the industry to create
innovative ways of performing and orchestrating activities. Through
vision and execution, this government-owned enterprise is transforming
its internal operations, its industry, and, potentially, the nature of
mining throughout the world.
Codelco’s story, like that of Burberry, Asian Paints, and Caesars,
shows how the first step in digitally transforming operational processes
sets the stage for further transformation. We’ve seen this pattern
in dozens of companies that use digital tools ranging from basic IT
to leading-edge mobile and embedded technologies. Digitally transforming
operations requires a strong technology backbone that integrates
and coordinates processes and data in the right ways. Then it
takes rethinking how you can manage your business better through
Â�technology and information. New opportunities follow, ranging from
customer experience to operations to business models.
THE POWER OF DIGITALLY
TRANSFORMED OPERATIONS
Let’s face it: transforming operations is less sexy than transforming customer
experience. Your internal technologies and processes may not
be as pretty and polished as what you show your customers. Your best
operations people may be more gritty and gruff than your salespeople.
But we all know that what’s sexy on the outside isn’t always good on the
inside (and vice versa).
Exploiting the Power of Core Operations 51
In industry after industry, companies with better operations create
a competitive advantage through superior productivity, efficiency, and
agility. What’s more, strong operational capabilities are a prerequisite
for exceptional digitally powered customer experience, as the Burberry
and Caesars examples in chapter 2 showed. Yet operational capabilities
are far less visible to outsiders than changes in customer experience.
The hidden nature of operations makes it a particularly valuable
source of competitive advantage. Competitors can see the Â�outcome—
better productivity or agility—but cannot see how you get it. The
operational advantage is difficult to copy, because it comes from processes,
skills, and information that operate together as a well-tuned
machine. Simply adopting a technology or process alone won’t do it.
For example, it took US car manufacturers many years to get good at
Toyota’s lean manufacturing methods, even though Toyota willingly
gave Â�factory tours to its rivals’ executives.10 More recently, traditional
companies continue to struggle to adopt the digitally powered methods
of online leaders like Amazon.com and Google, although the outlines
of these methods are well known. As these cases show, even when
competitors start to understand your hidden operations advantage, it
may be years before they can make the advantage work for themselves.
Opportunities abound. Companies in every industry and country
are already capturing the digital operations advantage. Executives
are making better decisions because they have better data. Employees
routinely collaborate with people they’ve never met, in places they’ve
never visited, and stay connected with the office anywhere and anytime.
Frontline workers, armed with up-to-date information, make decisions
and creatively resolve operational issues in ways never possible
before. Technology, from robots to diagnostics to workflow management,
can outperform human workers along dimensions ranging from
cost to quality to safety to environmental protection. Other technology
is augmenting human labor, improving human productivity, and
making work more fulfilling in jobs ranging from customer service
workers to attorneys to surgeons. By virtualizing business processes—
separating the work process from the location of the work itself, and
52 LEADING DIGITAL
providing decision makers with the information they need regardless
of the source—companies are using technology to truly leverage their
global knowledge and scale.
So where do you start? A great first step is to digitally optimize
your internal processes. You can digitize core processes, change the
way employees work, create real-time transparency, or make smarter
decisions. But this should just be a start. The best firms, like many of
the Digital Masters we have studied, go well beyond simple process
improvements. They see technologies as a way to rethink the way they
do business, breaking free of outdated assumptions that arose from the
limits of older technologies.
OPERATIONAL PARADOXES
OF THE PREDIGITAL AGE
To many executives, improving operational performance represents a
paradox of competing goals. Do you focus on the needs of the global
company or the needs of local units? On today’s efficiency or tomorrow’s
growth? On risk management or on innovation? It may seem
that you can optimize one or the other, but not both. Six levers of
operational improvement have traditionally created three key managerial
paradoxes (figure 3.1). The limits of nondigital technologies and
Â�management methods forced managers to make trade-offs on each
dimension, choosing “either-or” instead of “both-and.”
For example, the ideas of standardizing and empowering have traditionally
been seen as a paradox: artisans empowered to choose their
own methods were considered less efficient than workers at production
lines, yet the standardized nature of production tasks can make workers
far less empowered (and fulfilled) than artisans. Standardization
can lead to automation that further deskills workers, reduces wages, or
eliminates jobs.11 In a world where computers can do more and more
jobs that people once did, what happens to the workers?12
Another pair of operational goals often seen as a paradox is controlling
and innovating. Controlling processes tightly—ensuring they
Exploiting the Power of Core Operations 53
run exactly as designed and detecting any variation—can improve
Â�efficiency and reduce risk. Yet controlling variation can prevent people
from innovating the process in useful ways.13 Employees may be unable
to adjust global processes for local customers or to conduct experiments
that would improve the processes. On the other hand, loosening controls
to enable innovation can open the door to inefficiency or fraud.
A third paradox comes from the need to synchronize steps in complex
processes. Paper, offices, and status meetings were the Â�coordinating
technology of the twentieth century. That is why, for example, salespeople,
field service workers, and police investigators had to visit their
offices regularly in person and fill out numerous paper forms. It’s also
why so many employees can feel buried in status meetings and e-mail.
Traditionally, however, unleashing employees from their offices or
workstations made coordinating their activities very difficult.
As a result, orchestrating (which managers want) and Â�unleashing
(which employees want) represent another paradox of the nondigital
world. In the past, tighter orchestration required tying people
closer to the places and methods that did the orchestrating. It created
overhead that could reduce peoples’ productivity, restrict their
sense of freedom, and sap their energy. Unleashing people or processes
from old technology tethers can allow workers to focus on more

54 LEADING DIGITAL
important activities. But unleashing people can introduce problems in
the Â�handoffs betweenÂ€them.
Wouldn’t it be nice if these paradoxes didn’t represent stark eitheror
trade-offs? When asked whether you want standardization or
empowerment (or control or innovation, or orchestration or unleashing),
wouldn’t it be nice if you could answer yes?
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION BREAKS
OPERATIONAL PARADOXES OF THE PAST
Facing daunting operational paradoxes, managers typically choose to
reduce variation and flexibility rather than increase it. They redesign
processes to be more standardized, better controlled, and more tightly
orchestrated than before. This approach made sense in the days before
computers and was the focus of many computerization efforts over the
past fifty years.
However, the newest wave of digital technologies is different.
Technologies such as smartphones, big-data analytics, social media
collaboration, and embedded devices can break the paradoxes of the
predigital age. Mobile and collaboration technologies that unleash
workers from desks, paper reports, and status meetings can also orchestrate
workers more closely. Standardization that removes creativity
from some tasks can also empower workers to be more creative in other
ways. Technology that imposes strict controls to reduce process variation
and fraud can also help you to innovate those processes. Let’s look
at how companies are approaching each paradox.
Standardizing and Empowering
Ever since the days of Frederick Taylor, engineers have seen standardization
as a way to improve process efficiency. Through timeand-
motion studies and other methods, they broke each process into
its component parts, standardized each step, eliminated unnecessary
activity, and asked workers to follow a precise cookbook of actions.
Exploiting the Power of Core Operations 55
This kind of activity, even in the precomputer age, enabled radical
manufacturing innovations such as interchangeable parts and the moving
assembly line.
Standardization also makes automation possible. Process reengineering
and enterprise resource planning (ERP) efforts of the past
twenty-five years have led to dramatic financial benefits.14 Robots
have made inroads in standardized assembly-line tasks, working
Â�twenty-four-hour days without complaint and making fewer mistakes
than humans do. Robots can also make hazardous tasks, such as
Â�automotive painting, more efficient by removing the need for worker
protection safeguards. As computer capabilities increase, machines will
be able to substitute for workers in more and more tasks.15
But standardization can make humans more efficient without
replacing them. By providing consistent information on process performance
and the status of every order, ERP systems help humans
do their jobs better. Similarly, standardized processes in cockpits and
pharmacies can help people conduct their work more efficiently and
safely without eliminating their jobs.
Let’s look at how companies are managing the standardizing-Â�
versus-empowering paradox. It’s sensible to start with standardization,
since newer technologies are creating huge opportunities that did not
exist before. For example, mobile phones, e-business, and embedded
devices produce billions of data points that you can mine for insights on
how to standardize and improve your processes. But while some companies
continue to drive efficiency through standardization, others are
breaking the paradox to both standardize and empower.
Improving Efficiency Through Standardization at UPS
The success of global package delivery company UPS is based largely
on standardization and operational efficiency. The company operates
in 220 countries, with nearly four hundred thousand employees. In
2012, it served 8.8 million customers and delivered some 4.1 Â�billion
items. UPS controls a complex logistical web with millions of possible
permutations in service options and delivery routes. Jack Levis,
56 LEADING DIGITAL
UPS director of process management, explained: “We not only aim
to deliver every package on time, but we provide customers with multiple
service options to meet their needs. We even allow adjusting of
delivery choices while the shipment is in route. Executing this mission
means constantly orchestrating orders, adjusting route schedules and
following up on package deliveries with a massive fleet of ground and
air vehicles.”16
For decades, UPS has been a leader at optimizing its processes. By
standardizing its processes, even to the extent of telling drivers how
to step off the truck, UPS continually improves efficiency, safety, and
quality.17 New data analytics capability is enabling even further optimization.
According to Levis, UPS generates “huge amounts of data
feeds, from devices, vehicles, tracking materials and sensors. Our goal
is to turn that complex universe of data into business intelligence.”18
Route optimization is a key opportunity and a complex challenge,
as Levis explained: “We have 106,000 package car drivers globally and
we deliver more than 16 million packages daily. When you consider the
fact that every driver at UPS has trillions of ways to run their delivery
routes, the number of possibilities increases exponentially. The question
becomes: how do you mine the sea of data from our sensors and
vehicles to arrive at the most effective route for our drivers?”19 Cracking
the puzzle can have huge payoffs, as a reduction of one mile per driver
per day translates into savings of up to $50 million per year.20
Levis and his team used advanced algorithms to shave millions of
miles from delivery routes. The project crunches business rules, map
data, customer information, and employee work rules, among other
factors, to optimize package delivery routes within six to eight seconds.
An optimized route might look very similar to the driver’s normal
route—a quarter mile saved here, a half mile there—but the real benefit
lies in the accumulated distance saved across thousands of deliveries.
The project is a huge endeavor for UPS, employing some five hundred
people. But it generates significant operational advantage. So far, analytics
has helped UPS to reduce eighty-five million miles driven per year.
The reduction equates to over eight million fewer gallons of fuel used.
Exploiting the Power of Core Operations 57
The systems reduced engine idle time by ten million Â�minutes, thanks
in part to onboard sensors that help determine when in the delivery
process to turn the truck on and off. This technology alone saved more
than 650,000 gallons of fuel and reduced carbon emissions by more
than 6,500 metric tons.
Levis said, “We don’t look at initiatives as ‘analytics projects,’
we look at them as business projects. Our goal is to make business
Â�processes, methods, procedures and analytics all one and the same.
For the front line user, the use of analytics results becomes just part of
theÂ€job.”21
Breaking the Standardizing-Versus-Empowering Paradox
UPS has generated millions of dollars of savings through standardizing
its Â€internal processes. Many other companies are making similar
improvements and getting substantial savings. Yet, these changes, while
valuable, sometimes focus on only one side of the Â�standardizationempowerment
paradox.
Other companies have managed to break the paradox. Even if standardizing
can deskill or disempower workers, it does not have to do
so. Companies can shift routine tasks to workers who find the routine
tasks fulfilling. And if standardizing eliminates some workers, it can
empower the others to do more-fulfilling work.
The changes can be small or large. A manufacturer we studied
started to standardize, and then automate, many of the tasks in its
human resources (HR) function. The company reduced HR staff from
more than a hundred to fewer than thirty, while improving employee
satisfaction. Employees found it easier to manage routine HR tasks
through self-service systems. According to the vice president of HR,
the remaining HR employees are happier too. They can now focus on
“enlarging manager skills, rather than counting days off.”22 Looking
forward, HR plans to hire new employees as the volume of these moreempowered
HR tasks grows.
Asian Paints standardized the process of taking orders from the
retailers it serves. Formerly, a sales force of hundreds visited thousands
58 LEADING DIGITAL
of retailers regularly.23 Salespeople took orders for paint and other
products, answered questions, and contacted local distribution centers
to deliver each order. Orders were then fulfilled by local distribution
centers, which operated largely independently from each other.
Seeing an opportunity to improve operations, company executives
implemented a single ERP system to manage the whole order-to-cash
process, as well as advanced supply chain management capabilities.
Implementing the new system required the company to standardize
the way it worked, both within and across regions. It also provided
Â�better information and efficiency. According to CIO and head of strategy
Manish Choksi, “During this period, we built an extremely strong
financial and operational foundation for growing the company.”24
Executives soon found another opportunity to standardize processes.
Analysis showed that the company could improve customer
experience and sales performance by having workers in a centralized
call center—instead of salespeople in the field—take routine orders.
The change eliminated steps in the process and created economies of
scale in order-taking personnel.
As an added bonus, the change also improved service quality.
Formerly, customer satisfaction varied across regions and salespeople.
But the centralized call center, and its enabling technology platform,
changed the situation. For the first time, executives had a single view
of all customer-related activity across the company. They could ensure
that every retailer got the same level of service, regardless of the retailer’s
location. Managers could monitor the performance of each phone
representative, providing training and making adjustments as needed.
The improvement extended beyond order taking, as the system allowed
executives to understand whether some distribution centers were outperforming
others, and why.
But what about the people? Workers in the call centers perform
highly routinized processes managed by automated systems. Yet,
jobs in call centers are considered far better than the jobs many of the
call-Â�center workers could have obtained before. And although salespeople
lost a key component of their former jobs, eliminating routine
Exploiting the Power of Core Operations 59
order-taking empowered them to do something more. Now, armed
with mobile access to the company’s systems, plus training and support
from the company, salespeople have transformed from Â�low-skilled
order takers to empowered relationship managers. They can give greater
service to retailers and be more fulfilled while call center Â�workers are
happy to perform routine order-taking.
We have seen this kind of simultaneous standardization and
empowerment in many companies we have studied. In online pharmacies,
automated production lines do much of the routine work,
empowering pharmacists to do more fulfilling tasks: advising patients
and managing complex orders, not putting pills in bottles. At Caesars,
strong standardization and automation make processes more efficient,
but also arm employees with up-to-date information about each customer.
Customer representatives can decide to provide an upgrade or a
free meal without having to check with supervisors. They even receive
information in real time about customers who may need an intervention,
and can choose how to serve them best.25
Controlling and Innovating
Codelco’s centralized operations center allows its managers to know,
in real time, the status of all activities in a mine. Because information
is available in one place, managers can spot potential problems,
Â�coordinate activities, and make better planning decisions. Controlling
variation makes processes more efficient and safe, while real-time control
capabilities allow Codelco to adjust to changes in workload, ore
composition, machinery efficiency, and other factors. Yet integrated
information also helps Codelco identify areas to target for innovation.
In many industries, automation is particularly well suited to applications
that require control. Autopilots make minor adjustments to
thrust and direction to keep an aircraft on course. Process automation
mixes chemicals in the right quantities and temperatures to optimize
reactions and safeguard product quality. Accounting systems ensure
that people can only enter transactions for valid accounts and amounts.
60 LEADING DIGITAL
Yet, automated control can also reduce innovation and other
Â�valuable variations. Overly restrictive systems can prevent employees
from giving special perks to their best customers. Tight controls in supply
chain systems can force store managers to live with what headquarters
tells them, rather than finding the right product mix for their local
customers.
As with the previous paradox, the first place to look for opportunities
along the controlling-versus-innovating dimension is control.
New technologies such as mobile and embedded devices are creating
new ways to improve process efficiency, increase product quality, and
Â�prevent fraud. But while some companies tend to focus only on control,
others are breaking the paradox to control and innovate at the
same time.
Controlling Process Quality
Although Asian Paints managed both sides of the standardizing-Â�
versus-empowering paradox in its selling processes, it chose to focus
on one side—controlling—in manufacturing.26 Paint manufacturing
is a low-margin business with many opportunities to make mistakes.
The biggest driver of cost is raw materials, which constitute 60 percent
of costs. Chemicals must be mixed in the right quantities at the right
times, and materials can cause environmental damage if not managed
properly.
High growth in paint demand created the need to set up new
manufacturing plants every three years. According to Manish Choksi,
CIO and head of strategy, building world-class manufacturing plants
“calls for a high degree of automation to deliver labor efficiency but
also better quality and less waste.”27 Seeing the potential of technology
to improve manufacturing, executives opened a 200,000-ton plant
in 2010 that was almost wholly automated, followed by a fully automated
300,000-ton plant in 2013. The new plants are completely integrated
from an information management perspective. Data from shop
floor control systems and warehouses is linked seamlessly to the ERP.
Exploiting the Power of Core Operations 61
This has helped to further sustain the firm’s operational efficiencies.
Raw materials flow in from storage tanks, where machines mix the
materials and place the finished product into containers in a continuous
process. Technicians monitor progress and maintain the machinery,
but computers control everything else.
To the company’s executives, the benefits of automation extend well
beyond reducing labor costs. Automation has led to greater scalability,
better quality, and stronger safety and environmental protections. Fewer
workplace accidents occur. The company needs to hire fewer workers
for high-turnover factory jobs. Product quality improves because there
is less process variation. And with full telemetry on process steps, engineers
can troubleshoot production problems faster than before.
Controlling Fraud
New technologies are creating new ways to control fraud. Financial services
companies have systems and compliance organizations to detect
and prevent unauthorized trading. Credit card companies have realtime
automated fraud management operations. But digital technology
is opening possibilities in other industries, too.
Employee theft and fraud are widespread problems in firms. The
Association of Certified Fraud Examiners reported that the typical organization
loses 5 percent of its revenues to fraud each year.28 According
to the National Restaurant Association, theft for its members accounted
for 4 percent of annual food sales, or more than $8.5Â€Â�billion in 2007.
These numbers are significant because pretax profit margins often range
between 2 and 6 percent for restaurants.29
For example, in restaurants, opportunities abound for servers to supplement
their income through fraud. They can use multiple techniques
to steal from their employers and customers, including voiding and
“comping” sales after pocketing cash payment from customers and transferring
food items from customers’ bills after the bills have been paid.
These activities have occurred largely outside management’s eyes, as
servers become practiced at varying their techniques to avoid detection.
62 LEADING DIGITAL
Recently, a large US-based restaurant chain implemented software
to address the problem. The system examines the whole universe of
cash register transactions to identify cases of fraud that are so obvious
as to be indefensible by servers. Managers can then confront the servers
about the activity, armed with specific information about when and
where it happened. Corrective actions vary from letting servers know
they are being watched to fining or firing them.
A study of the system’s impact in a chain of 392 casual dining
restaurants found an average 21 percent decrease in the most egregious
forms of theft after implementation.30 Even more interesting,
researchers found that total revenue at each restaurant increased by
an average of 7 percent, suggesting either a considerable increase in
employee productivity or that much more theft is being prevented than
the system can detect. Furthermore, drink sales (the primary source of
theft in restaurants) increased by about 10.5 percent. This increase is
particularly important because the profit margins on drinks in casual
dining are between 60 and 90 percent, representing approximately
half of all restaurant profits. For restaurant owners, this type of digital
control represents an immediate opportunity to increase profits without
major investment or process change. For servers, it may represent
something else.
The possibilities extend to other contexts as well. For years, governments
have used computers to detect signs of fraud in tax returns
or equity trading. Now, they are looking in other areas. For example,
recent research has identified signals of fraud in automotive emissions
inspections.31 Governments can use these signals to target their
enforcement operations and reduce corruption.
Breaking the Controlling-Versus-Innovating Paradox
While the benefits of using technology to control process variation
and reduce fraud are enormous, technology can also spur innovation.
Measuring tightly controlled processes gives companies like Asian
Paints, Caesars, and Codelco the opportunity to identify problem areas
and improve processes. They can conduct controlled experiments,
Exploiting the Power of Core Operations 63
accurately measuring differences between treated and nontreated
groups. Caesars CEO Gary Loveman was once quoted as saying,
“There are three sure ways to get fired at Caesars. The first is to steal
from the company. The second is to harass someone. And the third is
to conduct an experiment without a control group.”32
A restaurant firm is actively conducting experiments in pricing and
promotion across a set of franchised booths in sporting and entertainment
pavilions. Using digital signage, the company can experiment
with bundling and pricing to increase sales. Sellers can change their
menus according to whether a baseball game, football game, or concert
is happening nearby. Now the company is experimenting with dynamically
adjusting prices to shift demand as a result of weather, time of
day, and inventory levels. The company shares what it learns in each
location so that others can benefit. But the company retests each idea in
each new venue to ensure that ideas from Milwaukee will really sell in
Miami, and vice versa.
Even more powerful is the experience of Seven-Eleven Japan (SEJ),
whose strong, central process controls increase efficiency while also
enabling innovation.33 The company has built an information and process
platform that connects every store to headquarters and distribution
centers in real time. Store managers have the status of every order they
have placed, whether it is for hot foods, delivered twice daily; cold food,
delivered daily; or hard goods, delivered less frequently. A dashboard
in each store shows real-time performance relative to similar periods in
the past. Managers know what is selling and what is not, and they can
vary their orders accordingly. The managers can even adjust orders on
a daily basis, such as ordering more hot foods on days that are expected
to be cold and rainy.
SEJ’s strong process controls also enable innovation. The company
routinely launches new products and tests them in a sample of stores,
getting rapid feedback on product performance. Good products stay,
and poor products drop. SEJ also experiments with services such as
banking and bill paying that can use the firm’s many retail locations to
provide customer convenience.
64 LEADING DIGITAL
The company has begun to foster new innovation opportunities
at the local level. Store managers are encouraged to make hypotheses
about what will sell, and order accordingly. They might see children
wearing a certain color, and order accessories in that color. Or they
might suggest a new product in light of what customers have been
requesting lately. Successful experiments turn into innovations that
the company can share across all of its stores. In a company where
more than 50 percent of products are new each year, the opportunities
afforded by local innovation capability are very valuable.
Seven-Eleven Japan shows clearly how technology can break the
paradox between controlling and innovating. The standards and processes
that reduce variation can also provide opportunities to conduct
experiments that improve the company’s performance. This kind of
experimentation on tightly controlled processes is a well-known innovation
technique for digital firms such as Amazon and Google.34 Now
it is moving rapidly from the digital world to the physical one. It would
not be possible without the integrated real-time data that today’s digital
technologies can provide. But only companies that take active steps
to use information differently can unlock the innovative potential that
digital operations provide.
Orchestrating and Unleashing
New digital technologies are unleashing people from the constraints
that once bound them. People can increasingly work where they want,
at the hours they choose. They can communicate as they wish, with a
few friends or hundreds of “friends,” sharing sensitive information Â�easily
with people inside and outside their organizations. To many workers,
this sounds like freedom. To many managers, it sounds like chaos.
On the other hand, digital technology can synchronize processes
more closely. Mobile scanners in warehouses and stores link directly
to inventory systems and financial systems, launching requests that
span your company and reach into other companies. GPS and mobile
phones allow you to track field workers, so that you can schedule
Exploiting the Power of Core Operations 65
them and monitor their performance more closely than ever before.
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and sensors on devices
provide mountains of information to track devices or monitor processes
in real time.
In using these new technologies and data, many companies focus
only on the benefits of orchestration. But more is possible. Some companies
envision how to break the paradox, unleashing people and processes
from constraints while simultaneously orchestrating activities
closer together.
Digitally Orchestrating Supply Chains
Digital technologies create many opportunities to orchestrate supply
chains better. Channel partners—suppliers, intermediaries, third-party
service providers, or customers—can share information on a real-time
basis. Proactive supplier collaboration and visibility of raw material
flow can improve order quality and reduce sourcing costs. Companies
that have digitally transformed their supply chains are racing ahead and
reaping huge benefits.
Kimberly-Clark Corporation, a US-based personal and healthcare
products supplier, built a demand-driven supply chain using data
analytics to gain better visibility into real-time demand trends. This
capability enabled the company to make and store only the inventory
needed to replace what consumers actually purchased, instead of basing
its manufacturing on forecasts from historical data. Kimberly-Clark
utilized point-of-sales data from retailers such as Walmart to generate
forecasts that triggered shipments to stores and guided internal deployment
decisions and tactical planning. It also helped the company create
a new metric for tracking and improving supply-chain performance.
The metric, defined as the absolute difference between shipments
and forecast and reported as a percentage of shipments, effectively
tracks stock-keeping units and shipping locations. Using this metric,
Kimberly-Clark has reduced its forecast errors by as much as 35 percent
for a one-week planning horizon and 20 percent for a two-week
horizon. Improvements over an eighteen-month period translated to
66 LEADING DIGITAL
one to three days less safety stock and 19 percent lower finished-goods
inventory, with direct impacts for the company’s bottom line.35
Apparel retailer Zara is another example. Zara supports its “fastfashion”
business model through unique buyer-driven supply-chain
capabilities.36 Designers and others at company headquarters monitor
real-time information on customer purchases to create new designs
and price points. Through standardized product information, Zara
can quickly prepare computer-aided designs with clear manufacturing
instructions.
In manufacturing, cut pieces are tracked with the help of bar codes
as they flow further down the supply chain. The company’s Â�distribution
facility functions with minimal manual operations as optical readers
sort and distribute more than sixty thousand items of clothing every
hour. Zara also leverages the close proximity of production to the central
distribution facility to reduce supply-chain risk and lead time.
Complete control over its value chain helps the company to
design, produce, and deliver new apparel to stores in around fourteen
days, where other industry players typically spend about nine months.
Zara’s smaller batch sizes lead to higher short-term forecast accuracy
and lower inventory cost and rate of obsolescence. This reduces markdowns
and increases profit margins. For example, unsold items at Zara
account for 10 percent of stock, compared with the industry average of
17 to 20 percent.
Orchestrating and Unleashing at Air France
Companies like Kimberly-Clark and Zara have created substantial
benefits by digitally linking every element of their supply chains more
closely. While orchestration-focused approaches like these can be
very valuable, other opportunities exist in breaking the orchestrating-Â�
versus-unleashing paradox. Operations become better orchestrated
while workers gain freedom to do some tasks outside the leashes of
paper, desks, and office hours.
Air France found that it could break the paradox by moving from
paper to electronic materials in its flight operations.37 The company’s
Exploiting the Power of Core Operations 67
documentation challenges extend to four thousand pilots and hundreds
of flights per day around the globe. Previously, each pilot, aircraft, and
flight route required a unique set of documentation on board, collectively
adding sixty pounds of paper to each flight.
Additionally, paper was a poor technology base for orchestrating
operations. Critical decisions about safety or scheduling waited as typists
entered information from forms into systems. Truly time-critical
processes required employees to coordinate manually by phone or
radio, and they often had to fill out forms after the process finished.
The logistics of coordinating documentation for each flight is no
small task. In the past, each plane carried reference documents and
pilots kept separate copies at home. Dedicated rooms in two Paris
airports—Orly and Roissy—held racks of information cards on each
destination Air France served. Each aircraft required specific manuals
and performance calculators, with variations depending on the plane’s
specific engine system. Back-office personnel prepared a flight folder
for each flight that included weather information, airport details, and
flight itineraries. This mountain of paper documentation helped maintain
the safety and security of Air France’s flights, but also created a
lot of operational complexity. Sebastien Veigneau, first officer at Air
France, explained: “In the past, we used to receive our planning every
month on printed paper. Planning documents were dispatched individually
to all four thousand pilots and all fifteen thousand stewards,
stewardesses, and pursers.”38
In 2006, Air France managers realized that technology could
unleash employees from paper forms and manual coordination, while
orchestrating processes more closely. The firm could reduce cost and
risk, improve pilot training, and make critical processes faster. Air
France started by digitizing most reference and flight documentation
and then issuing laptops to all pilots. The pilots could use laptops to
do tasks they formerly did on paper. Meanwhile, by installing tablets
called Electronic Flight Bags on its aircraft, the company paved
the way to reducing paper in flight operations. Air France benefited
because all notes were legible and available in real time and in the same
68 LEADING DIGITAL
place. Digital documentation was easier to maintain and update than
paper-based documentation. Pilots could have the most up-to-date
documents with a single tap. And passengers benefited by not having
to wait so long because operations were more efficient.
Although the initial process showed promise, it also encountered
difficulties. Application design issues and pilot reticence led to some
dissatisfaction. In 2009, the company paired IT personnel with active
pilots to develop a solution that was faster, simpler, and more modern.
In just a few months, the team developed an iPad-based solution
dubbed Pilot Pad that pilots found more useful than the original laptop-
based approach.
Air France’s operational changes were largely invisible to customers,
but the efforts affected customers through greater safety, better
coordination of flight crews and airplanes, and reduced waiting time.
Digital orchestration enabled Air France to improve its processes
substantially. However, the benefits extended beyond the tarmac.
The transformation also unleashed pilots from tasks that had created
frustration and extra effort in the past. Using their PilotPads,
pilots could access the company’s online scheduling platform from
anywhere in the world. Now, whenever Air France updates a document
in the library, 60 percent of affected pilots review it within
twenty-four hours, which allows the pilots to stay informed, wherever
they are. The pilots can also do required training courses more
conveniently. Previously, pilots were required to attend in-Â�classroom
presentations to keep up-to-date with the latest aircraft and
Â�practices—a challenge, given the typical pilot’s busy travel schedule.
New Â�e-learning modules enable pilots to complete training whenever
and wherever they wish.
To date, the Pilot Pad program has been a success. By unleashing
itself from paper, Air France his orchestrated its processes
Â�better than ever before. Plus, the tablet device has unleashed pilots
to do their nonflying duties wherever and whenever they want. As
Veigneau told us, “When Pilot Pad was rolled out, it turned flight
Exploiting the Power of Core Operations 69
operations into an efficient and user-friendly process. The only
Â�question we have from pilots now is, ‘When will I get my Pilot Pad?’”
Air France expanded the program to all of its pilots in 2013. Now,
seeing the solution’s potential for pilot engagement, the flight operations
group plans to continue pushing its boundaries through new
digital capabilities. For example, cabin crew are being equipped with
iPads in 2014.
BUILDING YOUR OPERATIONAL ADVANTAGE
The digital transformation of operations began in the 1960s and 1970s
with basic transactional systems. It accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s
with the introduction of PCs, e-mail, and online systems. It leaped
forward in the 2000s with mobile phones, ubiquitous internet, and
cheap global communications. Now it is poised to accelerate even faster
through technologies such as flexible robotics, advanced analytics, voice
and translation technologies, and 3-D printing.
So, how can you think about opportunities to transform your operations?
The digital operations advantage is about more than great tools.
It’s a combination of people, processes, and technology connected in
a unique way to help you outperform your competitors. None of the
examples in this chapter were only about adding new technology to a
process. They were actually about using digital technology as an opportunity
to rethink the way your company’s processes work. If you grasp
the power of transformed operations, you can create an operational
advantage that few others can copy.
In looking for opportunities to transform operations, don’t think
about mobile or analytics or embedded devices. Think about constraints
that you’ve lived with for years—constraints you don’t even
consider constraints because they’re just common knowledge. Are the
assumptions behind those constraints still true? Or can new technologies
allow you to work radically differently? That is where you can find
the best opportunities.
70 LEADING DIGITAL
Look for ways to apply each of the six levers to your operations.
And figure out how you can use technology to break paradoxes. But
don’t stop there. The Digital Masters we studied used multiple levers—
alone and in combination—to transform their operations. One change
led to another and then another.
Companies have unleashed their product design and production
processes from paper, opening up possibilities to orchestrate their
processes in new ways. Codelco used automation to control and then
innovate its processes. Asian Paints rethought assumptions from a
legacy of history, standardizing its sales processes while empowering
frontline salespeople to perform more-strategic tasks. Caesars
controls its processes digitally, while empowering workers to make
decisions independently and actively working to find innovations that
improve each process.
Digitally transforming operations requires vision that extends
beyond incremental tweaks. But it also requires something more.
Transformation requires good data, available in real time, to the people
and machines that need it. For many companies, true operations
transformation starts by overhauling legacy systems and information to
provide a unified view of processes and data. This is no small task, but
it is well worth the effort. As we discuss in chapter 8, improving your
technology platform is the foundation upon which all other elements
are built.

REINVENTING
BUSINESS MODELS
Do not quench your inspiration and your imagination;
do not become the slave of your model.
—Vincent van Gogh
We have shown how Digital Masters, such as Burberry, can create value
from transforming customer experience. They can also, like Codelco,
achieve huge operational efficiencies from transforming operations.
But some companies transform even further. They rethink customer
experience, internal operations, and economic formulas to reinvent
their business models.
As we described in the introduction to this book, waves of digital
change are occurring closer and closer together. Competitive Â�landscapes
are in perpetual motion. Many of the barriers to entry that once protected
incumbent companies and sectors have fallen. Competition is
global, and digital technologies have provided resources to go after new
opportunities. The shelf life of existing business models is becoming
shorter, questioning the very notion of lasting competitive advantage.
74 LEADING DIGITAL
Executives in every industry must be awake to the opportunities and
threats of rapid digital evolution and be ready to reinvent business
models as needed.
Business model reinvention sometimes involves radically shifting
what you sell, how you sell it, or how you make money from it.
Reinvention may involve reimagining the nature of competition in
your industry or reconfiguring your value chain to deliver at a substantial
efficiency advantage against your competitors. It can also
be about making the transition from multinational to truly global
operations, moving from products to value-added services, or moving
into brand-new markets. It may also entail creating new digital businesses
or services, either to augment your current business model or
to replace it.
Executives see the value-creation potential in business model
reinvention, for at least three reasons. First, reinvention can reorder
value chains and create big shifts in the competitive landscape. It has
already created or redistributed billions of dollars of value in sectors
ranging from retail to air transport.1 Second, well-executed business
model reinvention and its operational underpinnings can be difficult
to replicate. And third, today’s exponential technological innovation
is continually challenging companies with opportunities (and threats)
to fundamentally rethink the way they do business. For example, 3-D
printing is already generating new models of manufacturing as well as
new customer propositions in ways unimaginable a few years back.
But despite the buzz, business model reinvention remains elusive.
In our survey, a mere 7 percent of respondents stated that their company’s
digital initiatives were helping to launch new businesses. Only
15 percent said that new business models were emerging thanks to
digital technology.2 Many executives may not be looking for business
model reinvention opportunities. Others may consider them too risky
to attempt.
So why would you want to worry about business model reinvention?
Because not paying attention is an even bigger risk. Executives
in music, newspapers, and equity trading have already seen the radical
Reinventing Business Models 75
upheavals that digital business model reinvention can bring to their
industries. Industries ranging from insurance to education are starting
to experience the same thing. Whatever your industry, you need to be
on the forefront of challenging your current business model. Otherwise,
someone else will.
INCUMBENTS BEWARE
The business model that operates the London taxi market had been
stable for many years. Companies were mediating supply and demand
through expensive infrastructure: 24/7 call centers and GPS equipment
fitted in the vehicles. Despite this technology, getting a cab in London
was still not an easy experience. Something was bound to happen.
When three business entrepreneurs and three taxi drivers (all
cofounders of a start-up called Hailo) met in a Soho café in London
in 2010, business model transformation was the last thing on their
minds. Terry Runham, Russell Hall, and Gary Jackson—the three
taxi Â�drivers—had previously tried to get an e-taxi business off the
ground, with mixed results. Ron Zeghibe, Jay Bregman, and Caspar Â�
Woolley—the three businessmen—had an algorithm, built originally
for an e-courier business, which was looking for a new life. All six hit
it off instantly. They all agreed that the current inefficiencies in the
London taxi market could be turned into an opportunity.
The key insight from the taxi drivers was counterintuitive. Don’t
worry about the customer experience at this stage. Worry about
Â�creating a system that works for the drivers. The rest will follow. The
entrepreneurs saw the potential. They could create differentiation on
the supply side, where they could erect barriers to entry. Every competitor
wanted to lock in customers, and the competitors were fighting
a Â�me-too race with similar customer mobile apps. A different approach
was needed.
Early on, the team focused on fixing two fundamental pain points
that are core to taxi drivers’ lives—maximization of occupancy, and
isolation. Most taxi drivers spent between 30 and 60 percent of their
76 LEADING DIGITAL
time with an empty cab. So offering a job in exchange for a small fee
made sense. In addition, although taxi drivers form a small, close-knit
Â�community, they often feel isolated. So offering a social community,
something that would engage drivers and tie them together, made
sense. With this, Hailo created a precise value proposition for the supply
side of this two-sided market.
Hailo uses analytics extensively to provide drivers with a better
view of available jobs, how to get to those jobs efficiently, and how
to track performance over time. The app also gives drivers real-time
traffic updates. Drivers can send a burst alert when multiple jobs are
available in a given area, such as at the end of a theater show. Hailo
went even further by providing a complete logbook for individual drivers
on the app. Drivers can measure the percentage of time they are
occupied, the amount of diesel fuel they burn each day, their earnings
per hour, and a realm of other management data. They can set daily
personal targets and can compare their performance against their historical
profiles.
To remedy isolation, the app provides a newsfeed where drivers can
update their status and share information with other cabbies—a taxidriver
Facebook. Drivers can designate a group of their best friends,
whom the cabbies can track in the city and chat with throughout
theÂ€day.
Only a few months after the introduction of Hailo, average occupancy
had gone up significantly. These dramatic results amazed the taxi
community. Drivers claim that the use of Hailo has led to an average
30 percent spike in business.3 As a result, by 2013, over 60 percent of
the London cab population had joined the network.
But what about the end customers in all this? Hailo developed a
very simple and intuitive customer smartphone app. Once a customer
locates a cab, he or she receives its registration number and the name,
photo, and mobile number of the driver. On average, a Hailo cab is four
minutes away, wherever a customer is in the city. Unlike their competitors,
Hailo drivers also give customers a five-minute wait time before
starting their meters. Up until early 2012, 99 percent of payments were
Reinventing Business Models 77
in cash. Two-thirds of the taxis could not even process a credit card,
and there was a customer surcharge of 12.5 percent. WithÂ€Hailo, customers
can register their cards and pay with a single tap directly from
their phones. As of 2013, there were close to half a million registered
customers in London alone.
How does Hailo make money out of all this? The profit model is
simple; Hailo provides jobs in exchange for a 10 percent flat fee on the
ride. There is no subscription fee. As one of Hailo’s founders noted,
“Once you cover you costs, it’s geared towards profit.”4
Digital technologies have also enabled Hailo to have extremely
low-cost operations. Hailo does not provide hardware, so there is no
cost of installing expensive GPS-tracked mobile display units—the
cabbies’ smartphones do that. Through bulk negotiation, the company
helps drivers get great deals from phone companies. Unlike competitors,
Hailo has no need for the expense of manning 24/7 call centers,
because the algorithm in the software does a better job at scheduling
each cabbie’s jobs than people could.
The firm has gone global, covering several cities around the world—
often adapting its economic model to suit local conditions. The firm
has built a very successful business model in eighteen months. Hailo
founder Ron Zeghibe explained: “We understood that if we wanted
to apply technology to this industry, we needed people who knew the
industry inside-out. Listening and using their insights to build the
DNA of the business is paying huge dividends for us. We are now in a
position to go into any market against incumbents with a fair chance of
overshadowing them.”5
What Hailo shows is that using digital technologies to combine
excellence in both operations and customer experience, weaved into a
differentiated business model, pays dividends. Transformative business
models such as Hailo, or its San Francisco–based equivalent, Uber,
are rarely just a technology story. Digital technology is, of course, core
to the success, but it is wrapped in many other elements that together
make a great business model: Â�supply-side control, economic model,
customer experience, and Â�efficiency in execution.

FIVE ARCH ETYPES OF BUSINESS
MODEL REINVENTION
Although it has become part of today’s management lexicon, business
model reinvention is still an emerging field with several interpretations
and definitions.6 In the last few years, several books have contributed
to a better understanding of business model development or innovation
at the firm and industry levels.7 Some have also focused on the
specific role of technology in business model reinvention. These books
have looked either specifically at information-systems-driven business
models, or at disruptions brought about by business applications of new
digital technologies mainly from innovative start-ups.8
In this book, we have focused on how businesses conduct their
digital transformations from the lenses of large global organizations.
Leaders in large firms, looking to reinvent their business models, must
put their wide-angle lenses on. Emerging technologies, start-ups, small
new entrants, and firms in adjacent industries all warrant consideration.
Not all technologies are individually disruptive, but in combination,
they can have a substantial impact on your business over time.
In our research, we have seen all the models described in the literature
at play. Some are more common than others, some are more
radical than others, and some are more applicable across industries than
others. All options present opportunities to create substantial business
value. All have different risk profiles.
We’ve observed five broad archetypes of business model reinvention
driven by digital technology. The first, reinventing industries, involves a
substantial reshaping of an industry structure, as Hailo did for the taxi
market, or responding to fundamentally new consumer behaviors. The
second category is about substituting products or services—when your
core products or services become directly substitutable by a new digital
format. The third category, creating new digital businesses, involves the
creation of new products and services that generate additional Â�revenues.
The fourth category, reconfiguring value delivery models, means recombining
products, services, and data to change the way a firm plays in the
Reinventing Business Models 79
value chain. The fifth is about rethinking value propositions—using new
Â�digital capabilities to target unmet needs for existing or new customers.
It is worth paying attention to all varieties. Business model reinvention
drives opportunities to create new value. Both defense and
offense are important. Assume both your competitors and potential
new entrants—often from outside your industry—are already hard at
it. So how do you look at reinvention? Let’s examine the models we’ve
seen at play in our research.
REINVENTING INDUSTRIES
Reinventing an industry is a tall order for any firm. It does not happen
every day, and it is a complex and risky endeavor to pull off. Companies
often need to venture outside the comfort zone of the core business to
deliver new forms of value. Reinvention can also require new competencies,
new modes of operations, and new economic models.
Firms used to focus on developing competitive advantage from
delivering a superior customer experience, optimizing internal operations,
and developing access to wider distribution channels. With the
power of the internet and new digital technologies, companies are
now able to connect many participants with one another and create
new platforms for them to interact and transact.9 Firms can also leverage
assets they don’t own, and reconfigure their value chains—from
Â�buying IT services à la carte from cloud-based infrastructure providers
like Amazon.com, to crowdsourcing their R&D with platforms like
InnoCentive, to staffing key roles from global online job marketplaces
such as oDesk.
Platform economics does not apply only at industry level; we will
see later how Nike and Volvo, for instance, have used platform thinking
to create new sources of revenue or new connections to customers.
But all the business models we observed for reinventing an industry
through digital technology involved some form of platform play.
A well-documented example of a company that succeeded in building
an industry-changing platform is Apple. With the iPod, Apple
80 LEADING DIGITAL
delivered a convenient and user-friendly way of downloading music
onto a brilliantly designed player. But the magic came later, when
Apple launched its iTunes store—a service that created a tight link
between hardware, software, digital music, and videos in one userfriendly
package. The rest is history. Not only did Apple ensure that
the iPod became a high-margin product of choice, but the iTunes store
also allowed the firm to become a major distribution platform and
establish a base price for single-track music. Such industry reinventions
are rare, but when they occur, they fundamentally change the rules of
competition.
Multisided platforms are not new. American Express, PayPal,
and Square successfully linked merchants to consumers. Video-game
Â�console makers, like Sony’s PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox, linked
game developers and users. More recently, Google Android linked
handset manufacturers, application developers, and users.
What’s new is that the power of digital technology has substantially
opened up the scope of opportunities for platform business
models. Industries ranging from automotives to education to health
care and even legal services are becoming ripe for transformation. In a
2013 article, Geoffrey Parker and Marshall Van Alstyne paraphrased
entrepreneur and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen’s quote from
our introduction chapter to say: “Platforms are eating the world.”10
They argue that we are in the middle of a significant shift in business
Â�models—a shift powered by the internet and a generation of Â�connected
users.
Companies in what is commonly called the sharing economy are
rethinking the nature of large, asset-heavy industries, with implications
for the business models of large firms. Rather than allow all revenues to
go to a few big companies that create specialized assets for rental, new
companies are brokering connections between customers and people
who may want to share their assets for a time. From car-sharing to
accommodation and vacation rental to temporary workers to collaborative
financing and even dog sitters, collaborative consumption is
Â�making steady progress as an alternative consumer choice.
Reinventing Business Models 81
Think about hotels. Chains such as Marriott, Hilton, and others
invest tremendous amounts of capital to build specialized properties
that they rent to customers by the night or month. But other people
have similar assets that they would happily rent out to make some
additional income: a beach house, a spare bedroom, or a house in town
while they’re on vacation. Why can’t a company make money by taking
advantage of these private individuals’ desires to rent out their properties,
and profit from the relative immaturity of such a market?
In 2008, Airbnb saw a vacuum in the traditional room-rental
model. Airbnb is a trusted online and mobile-phone-based Â�community
marketplace for people to list or book accommodations around the
world. The company started small, but grew very quickly. It went
from 100,000 guest-nights booked in 2009 to 750,000 the following
year and passed two million the year after. As of 2013, Airbnb was
present in thirty-three thousand cities in 192 countries around the
world.11 Every night, it helped approximately 150,000 people stay in
rooms rented through its service—a significant number compared with
Hilton’s 600,000 rooms worldwide.12 The business model is based on
brokerage. Airbnb takes a 3 percent cut from the renter and 6 to 12
percent from the traveler, depending on the price and quality of the
property. For this charge, Airbnb provides customer service, payment
handling, and $1 million in damage insurance coverage for its hosts.
Renters and hosts can rate each other, thus increasing the trust and the
quality of the service.
Large corporations took notice. In 2013, Marriott, in collaboration
with mobile and web app company LiquidSpace, started renting meeting
spaces in its hotels, on demand, challenging the notion that you
have to be a hotel guest to use its facilities.13 Large hotel chains around
the world are now considering how to extend concepts of the sharing
economy to other parts of their business models.
The sharing economy is making inroads into many other rental
industries. Car-sharing start-up Zipcar was founded in 2000. Zipcar
customers can rent cars for an hour or a day, using their phones or
credit cards to reserve and gain entry to the car. Insurance and parking
82 LEADING DIGITAL
are part of the business model. Cars are conveniently located in Â�parking
lots distributed around town, rather than in a few rental facilities.
Drivers can access a car quickly, without wasting time on rental paperwork
and check-in processes. For drivers who need only occasional use
of a car, the convenience and price advantage of Zipcar over traditional
car rental or car ownership allowed the company to grow rapidly. It is
now the world’s leading car-sharing network. By mid-2013, Zipcar had
810,000 members and offered ten thousand vehicles in several countries
in North America and Europe.14
As in the accommodations industry, large firms got into the act.
In 2009, automaker Daimler/Mercedes Benz started its Car2go service,
renting Smart Fortwo cars on a per-minute charge, regardless
of distance traveled or fuel consumed. As of 2013, Car2go operated
over eight thousand vehicles in eight countries, with over four hundred
thousand customers signed.15 Meanwhile, in 2013, car-rental giant
Avis acquired Zipcar.16
Although it is unclear today whether such business models create
extra value or just replace existing business, there is no question that over
time, these types of digitally enabled asset-sharing models will become
significant. They will certainly appear in more industries over time. If
you can identify underutilized assets, find a way to optimize their usage
through a time-sensitive access model, and find the right economic formula,
you may be sitting on a valuable new source of revenue.
Reinventing industries through multisided-platform business models
has gained significant attention from business leaders in the last
few years. Understanding the underlying economics of such platforms
is a prerequisite to exploring industry reinvention. Recent academic
research has also advanced our understanding of platform economics.17
Multisided platforms can efficiently aggregate disconnected participants
in fragmented industries—helping to reduce what economists call search
and transaction costs, as Hailo did for taxis or Airbnb did for rooms.
Well-executed platforms can create significant barriers to entry
through network effects. For instance, the more buyers eBay gets,
the more it will attract sellers, which in turn attracts more buyers.
Reinventing Business Models 83
The value to customers on one side of the platform typically increases
with the number of participating customers on the other. In addition,
the power of the crowd can displace traditional gatekeeping, for instance,
when advice from fellow travelers replaces advice from travel agents.
Platform opportunities that reinvent entire industries do not pop
up every day. But they do exist in many industries. Crafting a new
industry-changing business model requires vision, creativity, careful
planning, experimentation, and investment. Few succeed, but those
who do gain a significant advantage.
SUBSTITUTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
In some cases, transforming the business model becomes essential,
because the fundamental product or service that you are providing is
being substituted by new digital technology. In such instances, you
need to replace yourself. To do so, you may have to cannibalize your
own revenues. But if the shift from your old offering to a new digital
offering is real, there is no other way.
After digital photography replaced film, and smartphones replaced
cameras, both Kodak’s and Fujifilm’s traditional business models
became obsolete. Both companies saw change coming. But Kodak
didn’t survive and Fujifilm did. Kodak stuck to its core for too long.
Fujifilm managed the digital onslaught by diversifying. It used its
expertise in chemical compounds to move into cosmetics, and in films
to make optical films for LCD flat-panel screens.18
In looking at your business models, if you see steady declines in
customers or profits, start rethinking quickly. You can experiment with
new models that use your brand, while your existing business still makes
enough money to subsidize the experiment. Your Â�experimentation may
scare away start-ups or give you an advantage over competitors who
try to threaten you. But these fundamental shifts are better addressed
early.
Beginning some two decades ago, individuals and businesses
have enjoyed access to multiple new forms of delivering and receiving
84 LEADING DIGITAL
document and text communications—from e-mail to social media. But
the experience has not been positive for all. Postal operators have experienced,
at best, a slow decline in their core businesses—the physical
delivery of letters. In Australia, for instance, the number of addressed
letters mailed declined 17 percent from 2009 to 2012—a 20 percent
revenue hole for Australia Post.19 The company has moved from 100
percent market share of written or text-based communications to less
than 1 percent within one generation. For this radical case of digital
substitution, a rethink of the postal services business model was clearly
in order.20
In response to the shift to digital communication, a number
of postal companies around the world have pursued electronic-Â�
to-Â�electronic (E2E) services. Accelerating the cannibalization of the
Â�existing business might seem counterintuitive. But these postal companies
believe that the integration of physical and electronic channels
could create a new platform that allows them to retain the role of intermediary
and facilitator in communications and commerce.
The Nordic Posts of Denmark and Sweden were among the first
to explore diversification into e-services in the 1990s. One of the most
established and successful postal digital mailbox examples is e-Boks, in
which Post Danmark holds a partial ownership, along with Nets, the
Nordic banking payment system.
e-Boks started as a closed, one-way system supporting transactional
business-to-consumer and government-to-consumer communications.
The company intended to provide an authenticated, universal
archive for consolidated household document administration. e-Boks
enabled large business and government senders to fully digitize their
transactional communications processes with consumers. e-Boks also
made organizations’ preferences for digital or physical communications
simpler to manage. To consumers, e-Boks offered convenience, security,
and choice in a familiar online system (similar to online banking).
The service integrated payment options, enabled media preferences
by sender, and offered a lifetime online archive for important personal
business documents.
Reinventing Business Models 85
e-Boks can be accessed on the web or via an app used by several
hundred thousand individuals. Two-way communication in e-Boks
now provides a secure channel for communication containing sensitive
information, like social security numbers. Receivers’ replies can be
downloaded directly into the sending company’s business applications.
Similarly, contracts and agreements requiring a signature can be handled
within e-Boks, generating an electronic record of acceptance or
rejection that is legally binding under Danish law. At the same time,
the portal solutions still provide consumers with a choice of channels.
e-Boks’ growth is closely linked to strong e-government policies
establishing the legal status of digital communications, and active government
support and adoption. State, regional, and local government
agencies in Denmark are linked into e-Boks, as are most banks, utilities,
and other major commercial organizations. As e-Boks added new
areas of service, the number of people using the service increased, and
network effects led to people’s increasing acceptance of the service. As
of 2013, about 80 percent of the Danish adult population has signed up
for e-Boks.21
Since processing steps like printing, folding, and envelope-stuffing
make up most of the total expense involved in sending a normal letter,
large organizations generally can reduce their distribution costs by up
to 80 percent by switching to digital mailings.22 The digital mailbox has
initially focused on personal business communications—account statements,
bills and invoices, salary slips, tax correspondence, and health
communications such as lab results. However, once the secure, permission-
based platform for connecting senders and receivers is established,
it creates further opportunities. New revenue streams from business
senders can be created: new consumer-centric applications, permissionbased
marketing applications, and database management solutions.
Most postal companies around the world consider a “sender-pays”
model—as with physical mail—the most viable pricing strategy in the
near term. But they are exploring opportunities around click-through
pricing, value pricing, and building modular subscription services for
consumers.
86 LEADING DIGITAL
When your core product or service is being replaced by new digital
formats, there’s no going back. You have to choose the right way and
time to disengage. Squeezing the old to fuel the new model is good
practice and will allow you to defend your core business for a while.
But proactively managing the transition is ultimately the only viable
strategy.
CREATING NEW DIGITAL BUSINESSES
Large firms can find it hard to create new sources of growth with business
model reinvention. The focus on growing the current business
incrementally and protecting existing assets can curtail radical thinking.
More often than not, start-ups and new entrants are the catalysts
for creating new digital businesses. But it is not always the case.
Nike has traditionally built its business through a combination of
strong innovative products, intensive brand building through multiple
media platforms, and efficient operations. As the possibilities
of new digital technologies emerged, Nike quickly capitalized on all
three areas. The company transformed both its customer experience, by
introducing new selling processes and connecting athletes worldwide,
and its operations with new design and manufacturing methods.
Nike did not start by strategizing on its business model, but rather
looked at ways it could provide even more value to its connected customers.
Beyond its presence in public social sites, Nike decided to
weave its technology and information together into a new business
model. The Nike+ concept was born.23
Nike+ includes multiple connected components: a shoe, a sensor,
an internet platform, and a device such as an iPod, an iPhone, an
Xbox, a GPS watch, or a FuelBand. The FuelBand, a product of this
new concept, can geo-track a person throughout the day, giving users
real-time updates on how many calories they have burned, or steps
they have taken, providing real motivation for athletes. Nikeâ•›+â•›provides
NikeFuel points, a proprietary metric for tracking fitness activity
that you can share online. Runners can also share their routes and
Reinventing Business Models 87
performanceÂ€online with their friends on Twitter or Facebook. They
can even get training plans from a digital coach.
At the same time, Nike gathers valuable data about how customers
use its products, which allows the company to improve its brand
marketing and, in the process, create a highly engaged community of
users. As early as 2008, Nike was able to learn things that it never knew
before: “In the winter, people in the US run more often than those in
Europe and Africa, but shorter distances. The average duration of a run
worldwide is 35 minutes, and the most popular Nike+ Powersong, is
‘Pump It’ by the Black Eyed Peas.”24
Through Nike+, the company has extended its business model
from providing only apparel to providing new hardware, technology,
rich data and useful add-on services for its customers. The company
is now attracting external partners to continually enhance the services
on the Nike+ platform. Not bad for an already successful company of
some forty-four thousand people. Mark Parker, Nike’s CEO, colorfully
explains, “One of my fears is being this big, slow, constipated,
bureaucratic company that’s happy with its success. Companies fall
apart when their model is so successful that it stifles thinking that challenges
it. It’s like the Joker said—‘this town needs an enema.’”25
Nike has increased its market share and developed new revenue
streams with a range of add-on products and services.26 It understood
the nature of its customers’ needs for engagement and asked, “How do
we provide even more value?” In this way, Nike engineered a coherent
digital platform that interconnects its products and services to the benefit
of athletes worldwide.
RECONFIGURING VALUE DELIVERY MODELS
Often, reinventing your business model will not be about changing the
rules of an industry, replacing your products or services, or creating a
new digital business, but will be about reconfiguring your value delivery
model. Using technology to connect all your products, services, and
information in a different way can build stickiness with customers and
88 LEADING DIGITAL
competitive advantage. When done well, it creates switching costs and
incentives for customers to favor transacting with you.
Many companies want to reconnect with their customers without
endangering the third-party distribution model that has been successful
for years. This is a dilemma that many traditional business-to-Â�business
(B2B) companies are trying to crack. It requires rethinking the traditional
vertically integrated model.
Insurance companies, for instance, have built profitable businesses
using agents to distribute their products and services to their end customers.
But what happens when the percentage of the population that
wants to work with agents drops? Or when you have become so disconnected
from your end customers that you find it hard to understand
their detailed needs? You need a new business model.
Many automakers are B2B companies. They produce cars and sell
them to dealers. The dealers then sell the cars to customers. The carmakers
are completely dependent on dealers to sell their products, yet
dealers are costly and can be difficult to manage. Even worse, dealers
own the customer relationship, and auto makers have very little contact
with these end customers.
Swedish car corporation Volvo decided to do something about this
traditional model. In 2012, the company relied on a network of twentythree
hundred dealers in one hundred countries worldwide to sell its
products. Dealers managed all sales and after-sales services. Because
they controlled the selling process, local dealers traditionally owned
customer knowledge. The company conducted traditional market
research, but had little or no direct knowledge of its end customers.
Volvo was facing increased competition. The nature of demand was
also changing—cars were no longer sold as a single product but were
sold as a transportation solution changing the nature of the customer
experience. Packed with advanced IT and communications technologies,
connected cars promised to provide customers with more effective
and safer transportation with less harm to the environment.
How could Volvo develop a more direct relationship with end
customers without disrupting its dealers’ relationships? The company
Reinventing Business Models 89
decided to undertake a deep transformation of its business model from
a B2B model to a “B2B2C” model, where Volvo would provide some
services directly to end customers.27 These services were designed not
to compete with dealers. In fact, the services reinforced the attraction
of Volvo cars, thereby benefiting dealers. To evolve to this new B2B2C
model, the company relied heavily on digital technologies—mobility,
social media, analytics, and smart embedded devices.
To increase engagement, the company started making active use
of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in
addition to its web presence. The purpose when interacting on social
media was not to sell—and compete with dealers—but to reinforce
proximity with existing customers, open a two-way conversation, build
trust, and increase loyalty.
Then Volvo did more. Addressing the need to add a push-to-talk
button to its cars, Volvo is developing its connected-car concept. Volvo
on Call, the company’s roadside assistance service, is delivered through
local call centers operating under global framework agreements.
A driver in a newer Volvo car can push a button to talk directly with
an operator in the call center. Through GPS, the call center provides
services such as finding the closest retailer, dispatching a tow truck, or
calling the police. In addition, the On Call service triggers automatic
alerts during an accident. The service is also available through a mobile
app, which opens commercialization to customers owning an older
car with no GPS or GSM (global system for mobile communications)
technology embedded. The On Call service is included for several years
after the purchase of a new vehicle and then is renewable, for a fee.
Of course, Volvo was not the first company to provide such a service.
The US company OnStar was a precursor, which other companies
then followed. What Volvo did was use the push-to-talk requirement to
reconfigure its value-delivery model with dealers and customers. Volvo
could get closer to customers without encountering strong resistance
from dealers. Call centers are too costly for any dealership to do on its
own, but are useful for selling cars. Dealers were happy to have Volvo
corporation handle call center activities, so they did not have to do so.
90 LEADING DIGITAL
Having incorporated connected-car functionality throughout the car,
Volvo started releasing new digital services such as stolen vehicle tracking,
door control, heater starting, remote dashboard, and car locator services.
Rather than bypassing dealers, Volvo is using its new customer
contact methods to provide information and services to dealers. The
company created a central customer database and implemented a global
CRM solution. Volvo now has integrated existing data from dealers
with a constant feed of information from the car itself. New analytic
capabilities allow Volvo to move closer to one-to-one marketing while
also providing dealers with information about their customers. In addition,
Volvo can launch new services such as maintenance reminders
that tell customers when dealers have openings in their service schedules.
It’s a win-win dual business model enabled by digital technology.
RETHINKING VALUE PROPOSITIONS
There is a lot of media excitement today around big disruptions created
by new digital business models. While they are important, not all
business model changes have to be disruptive to create value. Similarly,
the changes don’t always have to take you into brand-new markets. In
creating a new business model, you don’t even need to wait until your
current model is threatened.
Business model transformations can also allow you to reinforce
your presence in your current market. But these transformations can be
no less dramatic. They can be about combining products and services
in innovative ways: making better use of analytics, designing new economic
models, or repackaging your offering. Of course, not all of these
approaches are mutually exclusive, and some companies have combined
these models to generate even more value.
A puzzling insight about customers was bothering Japanese
Â�property and casualty insurer Tokio Marine Holdings. Many of its
customers needed insurance not on a yearly basis but for very specific
activities in narrowly defined periods. The company decided to augment
its traditional business model to address this unserved need.
Reinventing Business Models 91
Mobile and location-based technology gave company executives a
way to make the firm’s product more relevant to customers for specific
lifestyle situations. In 2011, the company partnered with mobile carrier
Docomo to offer customers a series of innovative insurance products
under the banner One-Time Insurance. These products were available
through a specialized mobile app. The app provides users with targeted
recommendations for certain lifestyle insurance products such as skiing,
golf, and travel-related insurance. Through the app, the company
can proactively send relevant and customized insurance packages to
consumers on the spot.28 In January 2012, the company also launched
One Day Auto Insurance—a new kind of auto insurance that can be
purchased on mobile phones. The product offers consumers the ability
to insure a vehicle for a required number of days when they use a car
borrowed from friends or family members.29
While some companies, like Tokio Marine, have used new technology
and data to enhance their value propositions, others have used
the data they already possess to create new value propositions based on
the data itself.
Entravision Communications Corporation is a Spanish-language
media company with significant reach in the US Latino audience, a
market that collectively has over a trillion dollars in purchasing power.30
The company, started in 1996, operates over a hundred radio and television
stations and digital platforms. The company was unique in its
ability to offer highly localized marketing in different geographies. As
Entravision processed a growing amount of both internal data and data
resulting from licensing agreements with its partners, it began to see the
potential value of mastering this new currency. Using advanced analytics,
the company started to obtain fine-grained behavioral insights,
which were highly sought after by companies selling products and services
to the Latino population.31
The demand for deep insights into Latino markets began to grow
beyond traditional media buyers, moving Entravision’s client conversations
into analytics and predictive modeling. Thus, in 2012,
Luminar was born. Luminar is a dedicated business unit that shifted
92 LEADING DIGITAL
from delivering internal analytics to offering big data as a service to
external clients. The company has since gained clients ranging from
Nestlé and General Mills to Target, among others.32 In 2013, the business
expanded further by launching the Luminar Audience Platform
for buying targeted online audiences. The company now collects and
analyzes data for fifteen million US Latino adults, representing around
70 percent of the US Latino adult population's transactions in brickand-
mortar, online, and catalog.33 The company that traditionally saw
itself as a broadcasting group now sees itself as an integrated media and
information technology company serving the Latino market.
MAKING SENSE OF BUSINESS
MODEL TRANSFORMATION
Successful business models do not last forever. Sometimes, the creation
of new value requires you to venture into the unchartered territory of
new business models. Business opportunities or competitive threats can
be the catalyst for such change. Digital Masters are not paranoid. But
they do assume that competitors, and new entrants, may use the potential
of digital technologies to go after their business. You should make
the same assumption.
First, you need a good grasp of your current business model (or
models). You should also constantly be on the lookout for symptoms
of business model change that should ring alarm bells in your organization.
Are you experiencing a gradual decline in traditional revenue
streams or margin erosion due to commoditization? Are new competitors
emerging from unexpected places or adjacent industries? Are
cheaper digital substitutes for your products or services making inroads
in your market? Are traditional barriers to entry coming down in your
industry?
You may choose to operate defensively or offensively. When in
defensive mode, companies often use data and any other advantage they
can muster to slow the decline of the old model. In addition, aggressive
operational cost cutting can release cash and investment capacity
Reinventing Business Models 93
to support the transition. But you can also decide to play offense. You
can be a first mover in rethinking the business model of your industry.
You can disrupt competitors, or other industries, by substituting
a traditional product or service with a new digital offering. You can
use new digital business models to create new sources of revenue. You
can reconfigure your value-delivery model and play a different role in
the value chain. Or you can look at opportunities to rethink your value
propositions, serving your existing customers in new ways. The scope
can be daunting, but the exercise is strategically worthwhile.
Don’t start with the technology. Start with how you can deliver
greater value to customers, and think about how to deliver this value
operationally at a profit. Then exploit the possibilities offered by digital
technology to help you get there smarter, cheaper, and faster. Learn
how other industries have solved similar problems or taken advantage
of similar opportunities.
Multiple avenues will be possible. You will need to prioritize
options that generate the greatest value to customers, that are operationally
hard to copy, and that can provide you with a profitable
economic model. You will also have to lower your risk by running
controlled experiments on your new model. At the same time, gather
the data that will help you learn and revise your assumptions. Often,
the technology shifts that create new opportunities for business model
change are the same ones that can disrupt your existing model.
Designing, experimenting, and implementing new business models
is a task for top business leaders. It is a strategic activity. Functional
heads will not have sufficient authority to drive new business model
experimentation across business silos. The implementation of a new
model requires vision, leadership, and governance. If the new model is
ultimately designed to replace the old, you need to know when to shift
resources and at what rate; the transition won’t happen overnight. If
the old and the new are designed to coexist, you need to carefully manage
potential conflicts and resource allocation between the two.
We’ve now reviewed the three investment areas that constitute
the what of digital transformation—creating compelling customer
94 LEADING DIGITAL
experiences, exploiting the power of core operations, and reinventing
business Â�models. Let’s now turn our attention to the how—the committed
leadership required to successfully conduct a digital transformation.

PART I I
BUILDING
LEADERSHIP
CAPABILITIES
Having discussed the what of digital capabilities, we now turn
to the how of driving transformation. Not all companies are
able to get started on the digital journey. However, for the vast
majority of firms, the problem is not getting people started—it’s getting
everyone moving in the same direction. Both challenges are the
domain of leadership. Leadership capabilities are essential to achieving
true digital transformation; they turn digital investment into digital
advantage.
In part II, we describe the four key elements of leadership capability.
Digital transformation starts when you create a transformative
vision of how your firm will be different in the digital world, and then
engage your employees to make the vision a reality. Establishing the
right digital governance model is critical, since it acts as the rudder to
steer your digital initiatives in the right direction. Finally, technology
leadership capabilities—strong relationships between IT and businesspeople
and the right digital skills—will help you build and Â�continuously
reap benefits from a well-designed digital platform.

CHAPTER 5
CRAFTING YOUR
DIGITAL VISION
We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry
all the power we need inside ourselves already.
We have the power to imagine better.
—J. K. Rowling
When Jean-Pierre Remy became the CEO of Pages Jaunes in 2009, the
company was in trouble. As the market leader in the fast-dying French
Yellow Pages industry, the company saw its print revenues declining
by more than 10 percent every year.1 After all, in an age of Google,
Craigslist, and Yelp, who would look for companies in a thick yellow
book? Pages Jaunes needed to adapt to the world of digital search, and
it needed to do so quickly.
Remy tried to convince his employees that digital directory services
were an opportunity. The company still had a trusted brand, strong
relationships with its advertisers, and a small foothold in digital services.
But employees in the hundred-year-old company were skeptical;
Pages Jaunes had always been the industry leader, and there was little
need to change the business. Many employees saw digital as a sideshow
98 LEADING DIGITAL
that was irrelevant to selling ads in thick paper books. The workers had
lived through the creation of Minitel—France’s revolutionary online
networking system of the 1980s and 1990s—with no impact on the
company’s competitive position.2 They had lived through the dot-com
bubble and bust of 1997 to 2002, and Pages Jaunes remained the industry
leader. Even as revenues declined, some employees blamed poor
management instead of a major industry shift. Very few saw digital as
the danger and opportunity it truly was.
What the Pages Jaunes employees needed was clear: a transformative
vision of the future that was more compelling than their current
view of the business. Remy found one such vision: Pages Jaunes was
not in the business of producing heavy yellow books. It never had been.
It was in the business of connecting small businesses to local customers.
Books were just an outdated technology; digital technology could
do the job better.3 This vision was clear and compelling. It painted a
distinct picture of the future while linking to the company’s current
capabilities. The vision made it plain that digital was the future and
that paper books would disappear. It gave employees an idea about how
their jobs and skills might fit in the new world, and how they might
play a role in the digital future.
Remy also announced an audacious goal: Pages Jaunes would shift
its business mix from having less than 30 percent digital revenues to
more than 75 percent within five years.4 This explicit goal stopped
employees from debating about how much and how fast they needed
to change. It also provided a clear way—digital revenues as a share of
total revenues—to measure progress. Anything that increased digital
revenues was good. Anything that increased paper revenues was less
important.
Remy spent the next two years helping everyone—from employees
to customers to investors—understand the promise that digital could
hold for the future of the business. He communicated honestly and
repeatedly with his employees. Some of what had made the company
great would still be valuable in the future. Other things would slowly
need to disappear. The company’s brand could still be strong in the
Crafting Your Digital Vision 99
digital world. The customer relationships that salespeople had built up
over years were still valuable, but salespeople would need to learn to sell
digital services instead of paper ads. Some book-oriented skills, such
as printing and delivery, would be less useful in the future. But Pages
Jaunes would remain in the paper business for several years longer—
time enough for people in the paper end to retire, retrain, or move to
another company.
Pages Jaunes senior executives moved fast to realign the company’s
investments and skills. They hired senior people who had digital skills
and the mind-set to work in the digital economy. They retrained salespeople
to sell digital services, and retrained designers to create digital
ads and webpages. They invested in prototypes for digital services, such
as web page design and mobile apps, to show clients how they could
reach their customers in new ways. They even inked a deal to partner
with Google instead of competing with it. Finally, Remy sent a strong
signal by freezing all nonessential investment in the traditional book
business.
The transition was neither smooth nor immediate. In a country
where firing employees is very difficult, some employees resisted the
change. Remy convinced some to join in the transformation, while he
found ways to work around those who did not. When digital revenue
grew more slowly than planned and physical-book revenue declined
faster because of the worldwide recession, executives had to restructure
the company’s debt. But customers began to see the value of digital services,
and salespeople learned how to sell them.
By 2013, four years after Remy announced his new digital vision,
and despite Europe’s economic woes, Pages Jaunes had nearly met
its transformation goals. Annual digital revenues were growing fast
enough to replace most of the company’s annual losses in the paperbased
business. For the first time since he had joined the company,
Remy projected overall revenue growth by 2015. While Yellow Pages
companies around the world struggled to handle digital competition,
Pages Jaunes has now become a company powered by digital, not paper,
technology.
100 LEADING DIGITAL
VISION MATTERS; TRANSFORMATIVE
VISION MATTERS EVEN MORE
The changes being wrought through digital transformation are real.
Yet, even when leaders see the digital threat and opportunity, employees
may need to be convinced. Many employees feel they are paid to do
a job, not to change that job. And they have lived through big initiatives
in the past that failed to turn into reality. To many, digital transformation
is either irrelevant or just another passing fad. Still other
people may not understand how the change affects their jobs or how
they might make the transition.
Our research shows that successful digital transformation starts
at the top of the company. Only the senior-most executives can create
a compelling vision of the future and communicate it throughout
the organization. Then people in middle and lower levels can make
the vision a reality. Managers can redesign processes, workers can start
to work differently, and everyone can identify new ways to meet the
vision. This kind of change doesn’t happen through simple mandate. It
must be led.
Among the companies we studied, none have created true digital
transformation through a bottom-up approach. Some executives have
changed their parts of the business—for example, product design and
supply chain at Nike—but the executives stopped at the boundaries
of their business units. Changing part of your business is not enough.
Often, the real benefits of transformation come from seeing potential
synergies across silos and then creating conditions through which
everyone can unlock that value. Only senior executives are positioned
to drive this kind of boundary-spanning change.
So how prevalent is digital vision? In our global survey of 431 executives
in 391 companies, only 42 percent said that their senior executives
had a digital vision. Only 34 percent said the vision was shared
among senior and middle managers. These numbers are surprisingly
low, given the rapid rate at which digital transformation is reshaping
companies and industries. But the low overall numbers mask an
Crafting Your Digital Vision 101
important distinction: Digital Masters have a shared digital vision,
while others do not. Among the Digital Masters that we surveyed,
82 percent agreed that their senior leaders shared a common vision
of digital transformation, and 71 percent said it was shared between
senior and middle managers.5 The picture is quite different for firms
outside our Digital Masters category, where less than 30 percent said
their senior leaders had a shared digital vision and only 17 percent said
the shared vision extended to middle management.
But having a shared digital vision is not quite enough. Many organizations
fail to capture the full potential of digital technologies because
their leaders lack a truly transformative vision of the digital future. On
average, only 31 percent of our respondents said they had a vision which
represented radical change, and 41 percent said their vision crossed
internal organizational units.6 Digital Masters were far more transformative
in their visions, with two-thirds agreeing they had a radical
vision, and 82 percent agreeing their vision crossed organizational silos.
Meanwhile, nonmasters were far less transformative in their visions.
WHAT DO DIGITAL VISIONS LOOK LIKE?
Where should you focus your digital vision? Digital visions usually
take one of three perspectives: reenvisioning the customer experience,
reenvisioning operational processes, or combining the previous
two approaches to reenvision business models. The approach you take
should reflect your organization’s capabilities, your customers’ needs,
and the nature of competition in your industry.
Reenvisioning the Customer Experience
Many organizations start by reenvisioning the way they interact with
customers. They want to make themselves easier to work with, and
they want to be smarter in how they sell to (and serve) customers.
Companies start from different places when reenvisioning the Â�customer
experience.
102 LEADING DIGITAL
Some companies aim to transform their relationships with their
customers. Adam Brotman, chief digital officer of Starbucks, shared
this vision: “Digital has to help our store partners and help the company
be the way we can . . . tell our story, build our brand, and have a relationship
with our customers.”7 Burberry’s CEO Angela Ahrendts focused
on multichannel coherence: “We had a vision, and the vision was to
be the first company who was fully digital end-to-end . . . A customer
will have total access to Burberry across any device, anywhere.”8 Marc
Menesguen, managing director of strategic marketing at cosmetics giant
L’Oréal, said, “The digital world multiplies the ways our brands can create
an emotion-filled relationship with their customers.”9
Other companies envision how they can be smarter in serving (and
selling to) their customers through analytics. Caesars started with a
vision of using real-time customer information to deliver a personalized
experience to each customer. The company was able to increase customer
satisfaction and profits per customer using traditional technologies.
Then, as new technologies arose, it extended the vision to include a
mobile, location-based concierge in the palm of every customer’s hand.10
Another approach is to envision how digital tools might help the
company to learn from customer behavior. Commonwealth Bank of
Australia sees new technologies as a key way of integrating customer
inputs in its co-creation efforts. According to CIO Ian Narev, “We
are progressively applying new technology to enable customers to play
a greater part in product design. That helps us create more intuitive
products and services, readily understandable to our customers and
more tailored to their individual needs.”11
Finally, some companies are extending their visions beyond influencing
customer experience to actually changing customers’ lives.12 For
instance, Novartis CEO Joseph Jimenez wrote of this potential: “The
technologies we use in our daily lives, such as smart phones and tablet
devices, could make a real difference in helping patients to manage their
own health. We are exploring ways to use these tools to improve compliance
rates and enable health-care professionals to monitor patient
progress remotely.”13

Reenvisioning Operations
Organizations whose fortunes are closely tied to the performance of
their core operations and supply chains often start with reenvisioning
their operations. The business drivers of operational visions include
efficiency and the need to integrate disparate operations. Executives
may want to increase process visibility and decision-making speed or
to collaborate across silos. For instance, in 2011, Procter & Gamble
put operational excellence at the center of its digital vision: “Digitizing
P&G will enable us to manage the business in real time and on a
demand-driven basis. We’ll be able to collaborate more effectively
and efficiently, inside and outside the company.”14 Other companies,
in industries from banking to manufacturing, have transformed themselves
through similar operationally focused visions.
Operational visions are especially useful for businesses that sell
largely to other businesses. When Codelco first launched its Codelco
Digital initiative, the aim was to improve mining operations radically
through automation and data integration. As we described in chapter 3,
Codelco continued to extend this vision to include new mining automation
and an integrated operations-control capability. Now, executives
are envisioning radical new ways to redefine the mining process
and possibly the industry itself.
The operational visions of some companies go beyond an internal
perspective to consider how the company might change operations in
its industry or even with its customers. For example, aircraft manufacturer
Boeing envisions how changes to its products may enable customers
to change their own operations. “Boeing believes the future of the
aviation industry lies in ‘the digital airline,’” the company explained on
its website. “To succeed in the marketplace, airlines and their engineering
and IT teams must take advantage of the increasing amount of data
coming off of airplanes, using advanced analytics and airplane technology
to take operational efficiency to the next level.”15 The manufacturer
goes on to paint a clear picture of what a digital airline means in
practice: “The key to the digital airline is delivering secure, detailed
104 LEADING DIGITAL
operational and maintenance information to the people who need it
most, when they need it most. That means that engineering will share
data with IT, but also with the finance, accounting, operational and
executive functions.”16 The vision will improve operations at Boeing’s
customers, but will also help Boeing’s operations, as the information
from airplanes should help the company identify new ways to improve
its product designs and services. The data may also lead to new business
models as Boeing uses the information to provide new services to
customers.
Reenvisioning Business Models
Some executives combine ideas around operational processes and the
customer experience to envision new business models. The new vision
may extend the current business model or may depart from it substantially.
There are many resources and frameworks that can help you
envision new business models.17 And in chapter 4, we shared examples
of companies that digitally transformed their business models. In our
research, we have seen two broad ways to form a new business model
vision: defensively or offensively.
Some companies take a defensive approach to reenvisioning the
model. Often, these companies are under threat and need to focus on
their long-term survival. For example, information-based industries
such as books, music, and travel are now going through fundamental
structural changes. The rapid pace of change in these industries is
forcing companies to redesign their business models. The defensive
approach is where Pages Jaunes started. Facing a burning platform, the
company’s executive team needed to create a vision that could drive
rapid change.
On the other hand, some companies are lucky enough not to
face a crisis; they can take a more offensive approach. Executives in
these companies can focus on the potential opportunity of new, digitally
powered business models, rather than overcoming a crisis situation.
However, lack of crisis can be both a blessing and a curse. It’s a
Crafting Your Digital Vision 105
blessing because companies in this situation have time to experiment
with new digital approaches. But it can be a curse if employees—or
their leaders—see little reason to change. Banco Santander is taking
an opportunity-based approach to its business model, highlighting a
vision for how digital technologies can help it break into new market
segments: “Our objective for the coming years is to exploit the growth
opportunities in segments where the bank has a low presence, such as
companies, insurance, and cards. Specifically, we are making significant
investments in IT systems and staff to be able to take advantage of
these opportunities.”18
A few companies go beyond the challenges and opportunities of
today. They create visions to prepare for—or even drive—the next
long-term shift in their industries. General Electric, for instance,
focuses its vision on the coming wave of smart connected devices. In
2011, CEO Jeffrey Immelt stated, “We will lead in the productivity
of our installed products and their ecosystems. This will require leadership
of the ‘Industrial Internet,’ making infrastructure systems more
intelligent.”19
Progressive Insurance has, for decades, had a vision to be smarter
than competitors at assessing risk and pricing policies. In 1956, the
company set an industry standard by reducing rates for low-risk drivers
with its Safe Driver Plan.20 The company then started to use proprietary
analytics to identify which high-risk drivers were less risky than
they appeared on paper. It could price its policies so that it got the
customers it wanted, while making other customers want to choose
Progressive’s competitors.21
Later, Progressive went a step farther, envisioning what would
be possible if it had information on customers’ actual driving behaviors.
For more than fifteen years, the company has experimented
with gathering telemetry from customers, offering discounts and
pay-Â�as-you-drive policies as an incentive. In 1998, it launched a pilot
in Texas using specialized GPS-based devices.22 In 2004, it piloted
TripSense, which used an inexpensive sensor that drivers could easily
install on a port in their cars. The information obtained from these
106 LEADING DIGITAL
pilots led to the Snapshot program, which is based on a similar device
and which Progressive launched nation-wide in 2011.23
Progressive’s Snapshot box is not a simple gimmick that separates
drivers who think they are good from those who think they are bad.
Through its telemetry boxes and analytics capabilities, Progressive
can link actual driving behaviors—speed, distance, acceleration, and
Â�braking—to risk. Because company executives have been willing to
invest in gathering and using new information, Progressive can offer
services that its competitors cannot. Through its vision of being smarter
than competitors at assessing and pricing risk, Progressive continually
strives to find ways that it can serve good drivers at lower prices, offer
lower-cost options to less-affluent customers, and encourage poorer
drivers to choose other insurance providers.
HOW CAN YOU FRAME A
TRANSFORMATIVE DIGITAL VISION?
There is no single best way to express a vision for digital transformation.
It’s not a formulaic process. You need to craft a vision that builds
on your strengths, engages employees, and can evolve over time. You’ll
need to identify the benefits you want, what the end point looks like,
and how you will engage your customers, employees, and investors.
Here are some steps you can take.
Identifying Strategic Assets
In crafting your digital vision, you need to identify some strategic assets
that will help you win. If the new vision can’t build on some of your
company’s strengths, then there is no sense trying to implement it.
Another company—one that is faster, more nimble, and less burdened
with legacy issues—will execute better and win the game.
But how can you identify your strategic assets? Start by looking at
what kinds of assets you have. Physical assets like retail stores or manufacturing
plants may or may not be valuable in a new digital, globally
Crafting Your Digital Vision 107
interconnected world. Competence-based assets, such as Â�product design
expertise, flexible and efficient operations, and excellent frontline staff,
can be very useful as long as the processes they support remain valuable.
Intangible assets, such as brand, reputation, and company culture, are
more difficult to judge; they can be very helpful to reach a future state,
but can also inhibit your transformation. Data assets can provide you an
analytic advantage over your competitors or become products you can
sell to others.
Once you have identified potential strategic assets, you’ll need to
assess whether those assets will remain strategic in the new world. In
the 1990s, management researchers developed a simple yet powerful
tool for making this assessment.24 Strategic assets are VRIN: valuable,
rare, inimitable, and nonsubstitutable. Valuable assets are those you can
use to exploit opportunities or neutralize threats. Assets must be rare,
and not available to most competitors. They must be inimitable (or,
to be more precise, imperfectly imitable), since otherwise, competitors
can copy them and beat you at your own game. And strategic assets
must be nonsubstitutable; otherwise, someone may find a different way
to do what you do, but better and at a lower price.
During the dot-com bubble, many internet firms found that customer
eyeballs were not rare enough to support advertising revenues;
paying customers were valuable but also far more difficult to obtain.
Newspaper firms thought their classified advertising operations were
strategic assets, only to find that companies such as Craigslist and eBay
could imitate what newspapers do, but could do it better and at a lower
price. Executives at film-rental company Blockbuster may have been
correct when they believed the firm’s network of stores was an inimitable
asset. Unfortunately, Netflix beat Blockbuster when the start-up
found a simple way to substitute for what Blockbuster stores did.
When Jean-Pierre Remy crafted a new digital vision for Pages
Jaunes, he didn’t start from scratch. Instead, he and his senior team systematically
examined the company’s core assets. Some, such as printing
and distribution capabilities, would have little value in the digital world.
Others, such as money and information about customers, could be used
108 LEADING DIGITAL
with little change, but were easily copied by competitors. However, two
assets—the Pages Jaunes brand and the relationships between salespeople
and their customers, could be strategic. These assets were valuable,
rare, and difficult to copy. And with some change, they could
become their own substitutes. That’s why Remy chose to build a new
vision around these assets. Pages Jaunes would continue to be a trusted
brand in the local marketing business, and its salespeople would help its
customers make their own way into the digital future.
Creating Transformative Ambitions
Having a vision is not enough. The vision needs to be transformative.
Incremental visions will limit the benefits that you can attain in your
digital transformation. Even if you succeed, the most you’ll get is incremental
payoff. If digital is leading to radical changes in every industry,
you can help your company by defining what a radically different digital
future looks like.
You can liken the situation to caterpillars and butterflies.
Competitors with the vision to transform into digital butterflies can
fly to new heights. Meanwhile, an incremental vision will only turn
you into a faster-moving caterpillar. Companies using analytics to
improve targeting in their physical or electronic mail campaigns are
making caterpillars faster. The real-time, location-based customerengagement
process employed at Caesars transforms the caterpillar
into a butterfly.
Your digital aspirations can be divided into three categories: substitution,
extension, and transformation.25
Substitution is the use of new technology as an alternative or a
replacement for substantially the same function that the enterprise
already performs. For example, if you use mobile phones simply to do
what people already do from their PCs, or if your version of analytics
is simply a better way to do basic reports, then you’re in substitution
mode. Substitution sometimes generates incremental cost or flexibility
improvement, but it doesn’t really fix inefficient processes. It can also
Crafting Your Digital Vision 109
be a way to experiment with new technologies before you do something
bigger. But something bigger is required.
Extension significantly improves the performance or functionality
of a product or process, without radically changing it. Many manufacturers
and resellers now enable field workers to access information
through mobile devices, reducing the workers’ need to visit the office
at the start and end of shifts. In another example, a pharmaceutical
company has created a social-media physician community so that it can
learn about issues and opportunities by allowing doctors to talk with
one another. While regulators put severe restrictions and audit requirements
on any corporate communication with physicians, there are far
fewer restrictions on monitoring what physicians say to each other.
Extensions like these improve on existing processes or extend the company’s
existing capabilities, but still focus on doing the same activities
as before.
Transformation is the fundamental redefinition of a process or
product through technology. When executives at Asian Paints used
embedded devices and analytics to create fully automated factories,
they changed the nature of their manufacturing processes, delivering
higher levels of efficiency, quality, and environmental sustainability
than were found at manually tended factories. Codelco’s digital mines,
the mobile concierge apps at Caesars, and Nike’s FuelBand are similarly
transformative. Each digital transformation reinvented the nature
of an offering, allowing the firm and its customers to do things radically
better than they could before.
Unfortunately, the previous examples notwithstanding, we found
few companies doing transformative things with digital technologies.
Figure 5.1 tallies the most transformative efforts for each firm
we interviewed during the first year of our study in 2011.26 Although
many firms were investing in new technologies, few were doing more
than substitution or extension. Only 18 percent of firms—fewer than
one in five—were investing in analytics to drive breakthrough change
in customer experience. Meanwhile, fewer than one in six firms were
Â�transforming their products or practices using other technologies.

How transformative is your digital vision?
Consider your digital vision. Are you aspiring to do more of
the same? Or do you see an opportunity to radically reshape your
Â�business—to unchain it from the shackles of old technologies and
business practices? Is your vision focused on only a single part of the
company, or are you envisioning a change that crosses silos? Executives
with an incremental vision get what they aim for—Â�incremental
improvement. Those who realize the transformative power of digital
can achieve much more.
Defining a Clear Intent and Outcome
One constant among the companies we interviewed is that people are
busier than ever. Employees have to work harder and harder just to
meet their current objectives. Few workers have time to work on a
broad, softly defined vision of the future. The vision may never become
reality. Or it may be very different when it does. Meanwhile, there are
more important tasks to handle right now.
Crafting Your Digital Vision 111
If you want people to engage with a vision, you need to make it real
for them. What does “good” look like once the vision is realized? How
will people know they’ve achieved it? Why should they care?
Great digital visions include both intent and outcome. Intent is a
picture of what needs to change. Outcome is a measurable benefit to
the company, its customers, or its employees. Together, intent and
outcome help employees visualize the future of the organization and
help motivate them to start realizing the outcome.
The CEO of Pages Jaunes clearly stated his intent to move beyond
thick paper directories while retaining the company’s valuable role in
connecting small to medium-sized businesses with local customers. He
shared examples of new digital services that the company could provide.
He then coupled intent with a concrete outcome: the company
would earn 75 percent of its revenues from digital services within five
years.27 This combination of intent and outcome gave everyone in the
organization a clear set of guidelines to envision new ways of working.
It also ensured that the transformative vision focused not on technology
but on finding new ways to improve performance and customer
satisfaction through digital services.
Similarly, Hispanic media conglomerate PRISA painted a clear
picture of how a digitally transformed media company would operate
across its wide range of media properties, from newspaper to satellite
TV to educational publishing. Video of a soccer star recorded in Africa
could be immediately available to PRISA’s media properties in Spain,
Brazil, and other parts of the world. Or the company could coordinate
social media and digital marketing with traditional media advertising
in global campaigns across media outlets. PRISA’s CEO, Juan
Luis Cebrian, gave a clear target: 20 percent of the company’s revenues
would be digital within five years.28
Evolving the Vision over Time
If you create a compelling vision and help employees believe in it, then
the broader organization can fill in the details. Aim to make your digital
112 LEADING DIGITAL
vision specific enough to give employees a clear direction, while giving
them the flexibility to innovate and build on it.
Asian Paints started in the early 2000s with a vision to move from a
regional company to an integrated one.29 This vision combined operational
efficiency with new ways to serve customers.30 The vision provided
a clear mandate for change while enabling people throughout the
company to refine the details over time.
Since then, Asian Paints executives have led three successive waves
of digital change—each building on top of the other. The first wave
focused on industrialization, the second on creating a customer-centric
organization, and the third on automation. It is moving to a fourth
wave, which will link structured and unstructured data—such as internal
and external social media—to further improve customer engagement
and internal employee collaboration.31 The company’s original
vision remains a key inspiration behind improvements in operations
and the customer experience, even as the company has extended its
vision through successive waves of capability.
Meanwhile, digital technologies are a moving target. They continually
change as some technologies die, others improve, and new
ones are invented. Nobody can reliably predict the next new technology
blockbuster. And it’s impossible to make specific long-term predictions
of how companies and individuals will use technology. Your organization’s
digital vision will evolve as technical advances and your new
capabilities create new opportunities.
The vision of using analytics to deliver personalized customer service
at Caesars started by providing better information in real time
to employees and evolved to self-service personalization through the
website. Then the vision evolved again to include a real-time concierge
on every customer’s mobile phone. At Progressive Insurance,
the vision of making smarter decisions based on available data about
customers evolved into new ways to gather data about actual driving
behavior. That change in vision led to radically new products and
decision-Â�making processes.
Crafting Your Digital Vision 113
HOW TO GET STARTED
An inspiring digital vision is the cornerstone of successful digital
Â�transformation. Though many executives are waking up to digital
technology’s potential impact, few have created a compelling vision of
the digital future. Digital Masters have a transformative digital vision.
Other companies need to create one.
As you craft your digital vision, focus on your business, not the
technology. Technology can remove obstacles and extend your capabilities,
but it is not an end in itself. Focus on how you can enhance the
experience of your customers, streamline your operations, or transform
your business models.
Aim to be transformative, not incremental. Make your digital
vision specific enough to give employees a clear direction, while giving
them the flexibility to innovate upon it. Dream big, and then ask your
employees to help you make the dream a reality. This is no small task.
Crafting a vision for digital transformation is a journey. You need to
plant the seed at the top, and then engage people at all levels to make
the vision live and grow. In chapter 6, we’ll show how you can engage
your employees to make the vision a reality.

CHAPTER 6
ENGAGING THE
ORGANIZATION AT SCALE
If my mind can conceive it, and my heart
can believe it, I know I can achieve it.
—Jesse Jackson
Ask any executive who has led an organization through a large transformation,
and he or she will tell you that a company’s strategic vision is only as
good as the people behind it. This remains true for digital transformation.
As we showed with the example of Pages Jaunes in the previous chapter,
creating a compelling digital vision is only the beginning of the journey.
Unlike incremental change, which can be achieved by a few people
working on their own, transformation can only be achieved through
the engagement of many. It is a commitment first made by leaders,
then by a few champions, and finally by the critical mass needed to
make the radical change happen. But what does it mean to be engaged?
In our definition, when employees are energized to make the vision
aÂ€reality, they are engaged.
Business transformation involves making important, sometimes
disruptive, changes in how organizations get things done. Core
116 LEADING DIGITAL
organizational processes are redesigned, new technology tools replace
old ones, new skills are developed, and new ways of working are introduced.
Winning people’s hearts and minds through that process isn’t
easy. As Sir Richard Branson once said, “Loyal employees in any company
create loyal customers, who in turn create happy shareholders.
The process sounds easy, but it’s not, and it has defeated some of the
biggest organizations of the twentieth century.”1 Employee engagement
matters. And it matters even more to succeed at transformation.
Fortunately, engaging employees in organizational change is not
uncharted territory. There is a wide body of research that explains how
you can use the power of engagement to successfully transform your
organization.2 Some of this work puts people’s hopes and fears and
other feelings at the center of the engagement strategy.3 Other work
focuses on individual and team renewal as a key step in the transformation,
or on achieving a psychological alignment and developing a
capacity for collective learning.4 But all work points to one thing:
engagement is foremost a task of leadership.
Digital technology brings another dimension: real-time employee
engagement on a global scale. Blogs, Twitter, and digital video are helping
leaders connect with their organizations in ways that mass e-mails
or town hall meetings cannot. Executive bloggers can share a frequent,
candid perspective on the state of the transformation, and digital videos
help put a personal face on executive communications. Additionally,
enterprise social platforms create a new breed of open, two-way organizational
communication, where leaders and employees can discuss,
share, and collaborate in real time.5 With digital technology, leaders
have new powers to engage their employees in making change happen.
CONVIVIALITY GOES DIGITAL
AT PERNOD RICARD
Pernod Ricard is a world leader in wines and spirits, with sales exceeding
$10 billion in 2012–2013.6 It employs some nineteen thousand
people in globally decentralized operations organized within six
Engaging the Organization at Scale 117
brand companies and eighty market units. The company is home to
Â�prestigious global brands such as Absolut Vodka, Chivas Regal Scotch
whisky, Jameson Irish whiskey, Perrier-Jouet Champagne, and Ricard
Pastis, the anise-flavored liqueur.
Created from the merger of Pernod and Ricard in 1975, the
company has grown its brand portfolio with three transformative
Â�acquisitions—Seagram, Allied Domecq, and Absolut Vodka. Already
leading the premium segment, the company has the ambition to become
the global leader in wine and spirits. Pierre Pringuet, Pernod Ricard’s
CEO, explained: “We’ve now posted thirty-eight years of growth.
Leadership is our goal. We want to be the company that leads industry
growth. But we also want to be the one that changes the rules.”7
For most companies, the combination of global complexity, a
highly decentralized operating model, and rapid growth through multiple
large acquisitions, is not generally conducive to building globally
cohesive employee engagement. Yet employee engagement and culture
at Pernod Ricard goes well beyond the corporate rallying cry. In 2013,
an employee survey, carried out by an independent agency, showed
that 94 percent of Pernod Ricard’s employees are proud to work for
the group, and 87 percent would recommend their company—a full
10Â€points above industry average.8
But employee surveys are lagging indicators. Such employee
engagement and sense of belonging does not happen by chance. What
really drove such results? In the last few years, Pernod Ricard has
invested heavily in its people processes and in engaging the workforce
around its strategy and digital vision. Alexandre Ricard, deputy CEO,
explained: “Our vision is to use digital as a game-changer for Pernod
Ricard. It will provide us with direct access to consumers. It will give us
more influence and unleash new dynamics in our relationships with our
trade partners. It will also allow the company to empower employees
so they can play a full part in this growth journey. And, a data-driven
approach will underpin all three pillars of this vision.”9
To share this vision, the senior leaders used all available platforms—
intranet, management seminars, and the company’s own internal TV
118 LEADING DIGITAL
channel (PRTV). Digital transformation was part of the challenge, and
the solution.
Wiring Pernod Ricard to Face the Digital Tsunami
As a global group with very strong consumer brands and multiple distribution
models, Pernod Ricard was facing the impact of digital technology
from all angles. Customers were talking about the company’s
products on social media and expecting more direct and engaging conversations
with the brands. Retailers, wholesalers, and bars were experiencing
their own digital transformations and facing new competition.
Finally, employees, particularly those of the younger generation, were
using more and more of their own digital tools in the workplace and
expected the company to be more digital in its ways of working.
Acknowledging that digital technologies were transformative for
the industry and the company, Pernod Ricard’s entrepreneurial culture
responded. Several units started their own transformation journeys
with a wide range of consumer-driven initiatives, from digital advertising
to social media to e-commerce. The units hired new digital talent
and experimented with new business concepts.
At the group level, however, the first major digital initiative was
focused internally: how to get the company to openly communicate
at scale. The company decided to implement a companywide enterprise
social network. In a company whose culture is as decentralized
as Pernod Ricard’s, wiring the organization was a prerequisite to share
and scale successful initiatives across brands and markets. In addition,
the most advanced digital units were able to support the less advanced
ones, creating real “digital traction.” The platform objectives became
strongly rooted around entrepreneurship, innovation, and getting the
organization to work in different ways. With this, the company’s digital
transformation started to accelerate. Alexandre Ricard explained:
“Leadership is built on example. It is also built on an organization’s
ability to adapt to tomorrow’s world. Digital has profoundly revolutionized
.Â€.Â€. the way we act, live and work.”10
Engaging the Organization at Scale 119
In light of the historic corporate motto, “Make a friend every day,”
the company introduced its enterprise social network with the tagline
“Share a new idea every day.” The platform engages nineteen thousand
employees in a continuous dialogue. The tool enables real-time data
sharing, visual communication, mobile collaboration, and instant messaging
on a global scale. From the initial decision through to test phase,
the network took less than six months to implement. But the tool wasn’t
the most important. What mattered was engaging employees to act as a
global team.
Key to success was vision, leadership, and business orientation.
CEO Pierre Pringuet explained: “In a group that is highly decentralized,
it is essential to promote the sharing of best practices, for instance
when implementing marketing or sales initiatives. We needed to create
new interactions where they did not previously exist. This networking
of collective intelligence has been instrumental to speed up the group’s
digital transformation at every level of our organization.”11
Pernod Ricard realized that without a strong top-down and
Â�bottom-up mobilization, change would not happen fast enough. The
company started by engaging executives at both the global and local
levels. After a period of training, more than 150 senior executives,
including the senior leaders, became actively engaged on the platform.
The project was reviewed regularly at the executive committee.
But bottom-up involvement was also needed. To be successful and
increase employee engagement, the enterprise network would need to
be anchored in real business needs—helping people in their day-to-day
work and making an impact on the company’s performance. Alexandre
Ricard emphasized: “You don’t do digital because it’s fashionable. You
do digital because it has a real impact on business performance.”12
To increase business focus, several use cases were defined at the
Â�outset—from innovation to brand marketing to business process
improvement. The network has also enhanced internal communications
and the deployment of new HR practices. Web conferences, or “coffee
breaks,” have increased participatory dialogues with employees to refine
and improve the introduction of new HR projects or ways of working.
120 LEADING DIGITAL
Employees have also found new and unexpected uses for the
Â�collaboration platform. As a group of Pernod Ricard employees perused
an airport duty-free shop while waiting for a flight, they noticed something
odd about the packaging on the store’s Absolut Vodka display.
They posted a picture of the display on the social network, tagged the
company’s compliance group, and asked if this was the standard packaging
for the region. Within hours, the compliance group was able to
confirm that the display was counterfeit. And within days, the display
was removed and corrective actions were taken.
But to scale employee adoption, Pernod Ricard went further.
Governance, communication, and training were deployed across
the firm. A digital curriculum was developed with “Pernod Ricard
University” to raise the company’s digital IQ. The company leveraged
its Millennial employees and identified early seeding-phase “champions”
to evangelize other users. New roles, such as community managers,
and new processes, such as content moderation, were created.
Adoption was monitored through a scorecard with clear key performance
indicators (KPIs) that measured both reach (the share of users
who log in regularly) and engagement (the activity and contribution of
users to the platform).
By 2014, Pernod Ricard’s enterprise social network had connected
84 percent of its worldwide employees. A quarter of this population
was actively contributing, with some thirteen thousand connections
daily—well above industry benchmarks.
Alexandre Ricard explained: “Communities that are created on
the network are free from geographical, functional or hierarchical
boundaries. Immediacy and discussion are now at the heart of relations
between our employees, and have become essential in our relationship
with consumers.”13
Accelerating Digital Transformation Through Co-creation
For Pernod Ricard, the implementation of a group-level enterprise
social network created real value in itself by connecting employees
Engaging the Organization at Scale 121
and communities globally. But it was only a first foundational step to
implement the company’s digital vision.
“With the first phase of our digital transformation,” Pringuet said,
“we have connected the organization and transformed the way we communicate,
work, and innovate. The second phase, the digital acceleration
roadmap, will help us to expand and accelerate this process. It will
make us go faster and further and become stronger in our quest for
market leadership. And its success is highly dependent on bringing our
people with us on this journey.”14
To tackle the digital challenges facing its brands and markets—Â�
content, commerce, social media, consumer insights, and internal-Â�
process digitization—the company needed new digital capabilities, new
ways of working, and other new behaviors. To achieve these desired
changes and foster buy-in, the senior leaders decided to engage the
employees in the co-creation of a digital acceleration roadmap.
The company mobilized a wide network of people called digital
champions, who were driving digital change in the company’s brands and
market units. The digital champions engaged their teams locally and leveraged
their local experience and customer knowledge. Pernod Ricard,
through that process, managed to prioritize the initiatives that would
have the biggest global impact on its brands and its business performance.
Today, the company is in full-speed implementation of its roadmap.
Practices developed in corners of the world are being documented
and readied for large-scale rollouts to other units. Individual brand
units are developing and running strategic initiatives on behalf of the
whole company. Headquarters is also playing its part, identifying synergies
and providing the shared capabilities required by the local business
units. This is engagement in action.
None of this could have happened without leadership. The digital
vision is being driven and sponsored at the highest level in the organization.
Nevertheless, transforming day-to-day business practices
at scale remains a challenge. Digital-savvy top managers and digital
champions at every level must continue acting as digital change agents
to engage their nineteen thousand colleagues on this exciting journey.
122 LEADING DIGITAL
Pringuet explained: “We have started a ‘digital movement’ that affects
all aspects of our company and requires all of our people to be engaged
in the program. Digital transformation will continue to be one of our
key challenges in the coming years. We will only win together.”15
ALL HANDS TO THE PUMP
As the Pernod Ricard story shows, and as we described in chapter 5,
before you engage employees to make the vision a reality, you first need
a compelling vision—one that energizes employees to do more than
just show up at work in the morning. Leaders need to do their job of
leading—setting clear expectations for what needs to change. But it
doesn’t stop there. Digital champions within an organization can have
a great influence on showing employees what digital transformation
means to the business. By setting clear expectations and engaging digital
champions in your efforts to communicate a transformative vision
for your company, you can reach a critical mass of believers that can
shift the organization to a higher level of performance.
But as a leader, how do you practically engage the organization to take
an active part in the larger digital transformation journey? Our research
identified three critical managerial levers to engage the organization.
First, connect the organization—using digital technology to wire the
organization so that everyone gets a voice and can collaborate. Second,
actively encourage open conversations to facilitate strategic dialogue and
create the opportunity for everyone to play a role in advancing the vision.
Third, rather than design the solution and attempt to get buy-in afterward,
crowdsource your own employees to co-create solutions. When done
well, the combination of these levers can accelerate digital transformation.
Connecting the Many
Digital Masters understand how new digital channels can drive
global employee engagement and transparent conversations to solve
business problems. Communication goes beyond blast e-mails.
Engaging the Organization at Scale 123
Wikis, micro-blogging tools, and enterprise social networks, also
referred to as Enterprise 2.0 tools, have received much attention
lately as key collaborative tools to wire up organizations.16 Enterprise
social platforms open strategic conversations to everyone in an organization.
They foster cross-functional problem solving at global
scale. Through these social platforms, business discussions become
visible to everyone in the organization, driving greater transparency
and accountability for what needs to be done. They also give leaders
the opportunity to publicly recognize contributions and reward
engagement. You need to find ways to connect your organization to
make this global dialogue possible. Pernod Ricard decided to use an
enterprise social network as the glue for a highly decentralized business
model. Other companies have chosen different tools, like their
existing intranets. The tool is not important. What matters is the
open dialogue and the engaging of the organization to deliver the
digital vision.
Consider the case of a large US-based medical technology company.
Facing a major strategic shift, the company convened three
hundred of its executives and top managers for a three-day workshop
to develop its plan of action. Over the course of the session,
video teams captured the discussion and the decision making. They
also recorded short digital debriefs with executives at the end of each
session to explain how the meeting was progressing. These digital
clips were then streamed in near real time to the entire company.
According to one attendee, the streaming produced a great sense of
openness: “You’re broadcasting, ‘Here’s what we’re working on, day
one’ back to their organization. So when [executives] walk out of
the meeting, people know that they were there and what they were
working on. And all of a sudden, the organization has an expectation
of follow-up.” Reflecting on the transparency created by the
new digital coverage of the event, the president said, “Last year,
we walked out of the meeting and told the organization what the
strategy was. This year, we’re walking out of the meeting, and they
already know.”17
124 LEADING DIGITAL
Engaging the Wider Conversation
To encourage open dialogue and increase adoption of new ways of
working, executives have to both lead by example and engage a sufficient
coalition of employees to get the change under way. Employees
who are encouraged to contribute to the digital transformation will
have a higher level of engagement and, in turn, will become better
employees.
One of the best ways to lead an organization into embracing new
technologies and new ways working is to act as a role model. Role models
set expectations for the rest of the organization and give employees
an opportunity to interact directly with senior leadership. For example,
senior executives at Kraft record podcasts (dubbed Kraft casts) and
make them available to employees with iPhones and iPads. These messages
help keep employees in the loop on the latest corporate strategies
and branding initiatives.18
Executive presence on digital platforms also helps create a pull
effect for user adoption. Consider Coca-Cola. The iconic company
is one of the top twenty brands on the planet for engaging customers
through social media.19 Coke’s corporate website is now a digital magazine.
20 Customers can develop their own personalized blends of Coke
products through the company’s smart Freestyle vending machines.
From the outside, Coke appears to be a leader in using digital channels
to interact with its customers.
But Coca-Cola encountered challenges when it tried to use digital
tools internally to improve collaboration among its employees.
The company introduced an enterprise social platform in an effort
to transform its self-described “secret formula” culture, but struggled
to sustain user engagement. In a 2012 interview, global innovation
director Anthony Newstead noted, “After an initial surge of activity,
[user activity] slowly drifted back down.” Newstead and his team
investigated the cause and discovered that weekly posts from executive
leaders were enough to attract other employees and sustain an active
community. “With executive engagement, you don’t have to mandate
activity.”21
Engaging the Organization at Scale 125
But not all leaders feel comfortable going online and showing the
way. In addition, sometimes the strongest ambassadors for digital
transformation may not come from the company’s most senior ranks.
Employees on the front lines can be the most effective vehicles of
promoting change in an organization. Influential supporters can help
recruit others to your cause. Many Digital Masters proactively identify
true believers within the organization and position the devotees to
share their knowledge and enthusiasm with colleagues.
In some companies, these digital champions assume formal organizational
roles. Nestlé, for example, introduced its Digital Acceleration
Team (DAT) in 2012. The team, based in Vevey, Switzerland, serves
a dual purpose as Nestlé’s “center of excellence” for digital know-how,
as well as an incubator for its digital champions. High performers from
Nestlé’s many brands around the world join the team for an eightmonth
assignment, where they work together to deliver targeted digital
projects such as developing mobile strategies for emerging markets or
developing recruiting strategies for digital talent. At the end of their
rotation, the team members return to their home countries and brands
to share their knowledge and skills. DAT alumni now form a global
network within Nestlé, and individuals know where to go to leverage
global practices in their home markets.22
Other organizations take a less formal—but no less effective—
approach. To overcome the digital divide between generations of
employees, several companies have established reverse-mentoring programs.
L’Oréal, for example, launched its digital reverse-mentoring
program as part of a campaign to raise the digital IQ of its employees
and brands. The company paired 120 young, digital-savvy workers with
more-senior management committee members. Each partner brought
a different set of skills to the partnership. Younger workers shared their
knowledge of digital channels and shopper behaviors, while senior managers
shared insights from their years of experience in the company and
industry. Together, the teams worked to identify key trends and understand
the behaviors of new customers.23 Individually, each partner walked
away engaged from the experience with new skills and new insights.
126 LEADING DIGITAL
Taking Advantage of the Crowd
Engaging the wider organization to chart the path to a company’s
Â�digital future is healthy. The value of employees goes beyond their dayto-
day jobs. Digitally savvy companies use crowdsourcing techniques
to create solutions for their most strategic problems. Crowdsourcing
gives employees a voice to actively engage in debates and share their
views and ideas. With the rise of a more digitally aware working population,
companies that don’t learn how to engage with employees in a
collaborative way will lose out.
Pernod Ricard, as we’ve seen earlier, took this step of employee collaboration
to co-design and prioritize its entire digital transformation
roadmap, to great effect. Other companies have crowdsourced employees
to improve aspects of the customer experience, make operations more
efficient, or co-create new ways of working. Still others have used crowdsourcing
to institute a continuous flow of innovation. The potential applications
are endless, as are the benefits when crowdsourcing is done right.
Crowdsourcing your employees can sometimes solve very pragmatic
operational issues. French-based telecom provider Orange suffered
from a common operational problem for operators: cable theft.
The impact on operations was significant and costly, involving line
downtime, field-force interventions, and other problems. Through its
internal employee crowdsourcing platform, called idClic, Orange identified
one employee who had developed a mobile app that enabled a
much faster resolution of this problem—fast alarms to the police, clear
process steps, and intervention management. The result was one million
euros in savings per year for Orange on this idea alone.24
Engaging your employees can also be fruitful for collaborative
innovation. Companies have traditionally been very specific about who
engages in innovation, assigning responsibility according to an employee’s
skill or role. In a digital world, this sort of segregation is no longer
desirable.
EMC, for example, harnesses the collective power of its global
employee base to drive innovation in its products and operations.
Engaging the Organization at Scale 127
The $21 billion company is a leader in enterprise storage, security,
Â�virtualization, and cloud technology. But staying on top of digital innovation
in the fast-moving high-tech industry is a strategic imperative.
The company began running regional innovation contests in 2007,
and their popularity quickly outpaced the small innovation team’s
ability to deal with the thousands of submissions received. The team
needed a more scalable process for evaluating ideas. And it needed a
way to ensure that good runner-up ideas didn’t fall through the cracks.
A year later, the company launched an online platform to help
manage the idea submission and review process.25 Contest participants
could post ideas that were visible to the entire global community.
Community members around the world could then comment on each
idea, provide feedback, and vote for their favorites. Since participation
in the community wasn’t limited to just those who had submitted ideas,
anyone in EMC around the world had the opportunity to contribute.
The contest committee presents a People’s Choice award to the idea
that gets the highest popular vote each year. Senior EMC experts choose
the other awards, but the social input helps the judges see potentially great
ideas to consider and helps the innovators improve their idea submissions.
In 2010, nearly four thousand EMC employees submitted ideas,
commented, or voted in the company’s annual innovation contest.26
Today EMC organizes the global innovation process on a
Â�calendar-year basis. But EMC’s innovation process required more
than a technology platform. Executive engagement was critical. The
corporate chief technology officer (CTO) created a small internal unit
to manage the contests, foster sharing across regions, and coach winning
innovators in making their ideas a reality. In addition, the heads
of major business units can sponsor tracks in the innovation contest.
But to do so, they must agree to choose the winner from a list of finalists
and provide seed money for winning teams.
Global employee engagement was also critical. EMC announces
winners at an internal innovation conference. Each year, on a chosen
day, employees in sites around the world gather for a day of activities
128 LEADING DIGITAL
that include executive speeches, videos, and guest speakers in addition
to award announcements. Groups in Ireland, Israel, the United States,
and other locations build their own schedules for the day, while attending
global sessions remotely. The success of the corporate innovation
contest has spawned local contests around the world. For example,
people in China conduct their own award programs and share the winning
concepts with the rest of the company. This engaging innovation
process has now become part of EMC’s ways of working.
The benefits are apparent, too. One winning idea was a consumer
product that enables individuals to create a virtualized copy of their
desktop that they can carry to any other PC. Another fostered a brandnew
architecture for cloud-based and “internet-of-everything” product
development. But the benefits extend beyond winning ideas. At a
recent innovation conference, several sponsors stated, “I am funding
the winner, but I’ll be happy to champion the other finalists if you need
me.” And senior executives cite a palpable feeling that the process is
creating more innovation, collaboration, and employee engagement
across the company’s business units. Employees feel part of a more unified
global organization.27
Some companies even go beyond just crowdsourcing their own
employees. They engage external partners and customers in an open
innovation process.28
Procter & Gamble, for instance, has embraced an open innovation
philosophy with strong drive from senior leadership. The aim was to
bring a constant flow of outside innovations while internally developing
the gating processes to manage ideas from inception to launch. Former
CEO Bob McDonald explained: “People will innovate for financial
gains or for competitive advantage, but this can be self-limiting. There
needs to be an emotional component as well—a source of inspiration
that motivates people.”29
To support this effort, P&G developed its Connect + Develop portal
several years ago. The portal’s aim was to invite everybody—customers,
suppliers, competitors, scientists, entrepreneurs, and Â�others—to
submit ideas. P&G not only publicizes what it knows and what it
Engaging the Organization at Scale 129
can do, but also highlights what it needs. In addition, the company
doesn’t restrict itself to product development; it’s looking for new ideas
in everything, from trademarks, packaging, and marketing models to
engineering, business services, and design. Bruce Brown, P&G’s CTO,
said: “Connect + Develop has helped deliver some of P&G’s leading
innovations, and is critical in helping us deliver on our renewed growth
strategy moving forward.”30
In 2010, P&G extended its program to become the partner of
choice for innovative collaboration and to triple the contribution of
Connect + Drive to the company’s innovation development. P&G has
expanded the program to forge additional connections with government
labs, universities, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, consortia,
and venture capital firms.31
Accepting the Sometimes-Rough Waters of Engagement
So are we facing a new engagement holy grail, thanks to digital technology?
For all its merits, new technology also has its implementation
challenges. Familiarity with digital technology varies widely across
employees. Even digital-savvy employees don’t always adopt new tools
naturally. New ways of working can become a threat to the conventional
way of doing things, for instance, taking responsibility away
from middle management. Often, new digital practices create a more
open, collaborative, and transparent work environment. But not everyone
will be comfortable, especially those who owe their success in the
company to the old way of doing things. One executive said, “We have
a very tenured organization and an organization that has a whole lot of
experience of doing things the way they have always been done. Trying
to motivate people around changing that is a real challenge.”32
Many companies face some version of these challenges when the
conversation around digital transformation, itself, goes digital. We’ve
seen many companies overcome these challenges effectively.
A gap is growing between workers who are familiar with digital
tools and those who are not. A digital divide is opening up. Millennial
130 LEADING DIGITAL
employees are avid users of technology in their personal lives and are
underwhelmed by the enterprise tools available to them at work. One
executive commented, “These people coming into the company, midtwenties,
late twenties, even early thirties, they do everything electronically.
They say ‘Come on, I know the company is over a hundred years
old, but our IT capabilities don’t have to match the age of the company!’”
Meanwhile, their more tenured counterparts still face a steep
learning curve to adopt digital ways of working. This gap is leaving
executives with the dilemma of alienating either group in the communication
channels they choose. It needs to be actively managed. Business
leaders need to work hard to use the best communication tools they
have and encourage both groups to break their habits. For example,
younger workers can be encouraged to pick up the telephone—or even
walk to a colleague’s office—when a serious misunderstanding is a distinct
possibility. Similarly, older workers can be taught the benefits of
participating in company blogs or other social media to get themselves
out of a creative rut.
Digital tools can increase transparency in an organization.
Generally, this is a good thing, but it can also increase resistance to
change. Some managers may perceive increased transparency as an
affront to their autonomy or a threat to their role in the company. Other
managers engage in the conversation proactively. Some will eschew the
conversation entirely, and others will openly challenge the use of digital
platforms. Because managers are often on the front lines of introducing
change into an organization, their level of engagement should be a serious
concern for executives.
When a global company we studied implemented a new reporting
platform as part of its transformation, many managers balked. Before
the new platform, sales managers produced reports that were based on
the managers’ own internal systems. They controlled the numbers that
were reported and the level of detail provided. The new system collected
revenue and profitability data centrally and produced reports in a standard
format. According to one executive, “That kind of Â�transparency—
they’re not used to it, so there was an initial pushback.”
Engaging the Organization at Scale 131
Executives at the company made it clear that the new platform was
reinforcing the idea of operating as a single company and that sales
managers retained decision-making authority for their respective units.
The leaders also made a conscious effort to frame benefits in terms that
mattered to the managers. They showed the sales managers howÂ€the
new information in the reports could help the managers sell more,
minimize inventory holdings, and eliminate the hours spent building
spreadsheets each month. Looking back, executives credit the new
reporting platform with creating significant cultural change. “It’s no
longer a blame game,” said one executive. “We live and we die together.
The only way we’re going to survive is if we’re transparent and open to
communication with each other.”
ENGAGING TO MAKE YOUR DIGITAL
VISION A REALITY
Digital Masters create a compelling vision of the future. They know
where they want to go and what success will look like once they get
there. But they also understand that digital transformation requires the
concerted effort of the whole organization to turn that vision into reality.
New processes, new business models, and new ways of working will
affect people throughout the organization. Many leaders in these companies
walk the talk. They embrace new digital channels not just to set
a good example, but because these tools make these executives more
effective leaders of change. Employees also use technology to stay more
connected to each other. They make active contributions to the conversation
around digital transformation and collaborate with their peers to
solve its challenges.
Whatever leadership role you play in digital transformation, engaging
your employees should be high on your agenda. Experiment with
new ways of communicating, collaborating, and connecting with your
colleagues, and engage them in a two-way conversation. Lead by
example to champion new digital ways of working, and recruit other
true believers to join you. Engage the critical mass of employees that
132 LEADING DIGITAL
is needed to move your organization to a new level. And focus on the
conversations that are critical to solve business problems, not the tools
themselves.
Some will remain skeptical about new technology and its role in
the organization. But engaging the organization is not optional if you
want to succeed with your digital transformation—it is necessary.
Conversely, when used effectively, digital technology can help you
engage employees at scale.

CHAPTER 7
GOVERNING THE
TRANSFORMATION
My fault, my failure, is not in the passions I have,
but in my lack of control of them.
—Jack Kerouac
Even with a strong, engaging vision, it is extremely difficult to channel
your organization’s efforts in a single direction. Large, complex companies
are full of entropy, constantly moving in the direction of less
order rather than more. Once engaged in a compelling vision, managers
throughout the company may move in their own directions to make
the vision a reality. Other managers, not having bought into the vision,
may try to ignore it. Some units may move too slowly, while others
may introduce risk by moving before they have truly thought through
regulatory, security, and organizational risks. Other units may waste
resources on duplicative, uncoordinated, or incompatible efforts.
That’s where digital governance comes in. Digital governance
helps to steer the company’s digital activities in the right direction. It
turns the diverse energy of employees throughout the organization into
a coherent engine that drives digital transformation forward.
134 LEADING DIGITAL
DIGITAL GOVERNANCE AT P&G
Procter & Gamble (P&G) is a global consumer goods leader. Headquartered
in Cincinnati, Ohio, it has operations in about seventy countries
and more than 120,000 employees. In 2013, the company had
sales of more than $84 Â�billion. P&G’s ex-CEO Bob McDonald recognized
the transformative potential of digital technologies for traditional
industries. He set a clear goal: “We want Procter & Gamble to be the
most digitally-enabled company in the world.”1 Achieving such a goal
required a focus on digital throughout the company, which McDonald
described in this way: “[We want] to digitize the work of the company
from the creation of molecules all the way to running our factories
off of the point of sale data of our retail partners.”2 P&G subsequently
embarked on a multiyear digital transformation program to make that
happen.
McDonald’s vision was enough to set the transformation in motion,
but more was needed to make the transformation successful. P&G
needed very strong digital governance to turn the vision into reality across
the company’s many brands and regions. With the right governance
mechanisms in place, P&G could allocate digital funding wisely, promote
sharing across business units, provide centralized tools and skills to help
business units innovate, and start to build a digital culture across P&G.
Foundations of Digital Governance
Fortunately, in building digital governance, P&G did not need to start
from scratch. Although the idea of centralized governance can run counter
to the culture of large diversified companies, P&G already had useful
elements in place. In particular, Global Business Solutions (GBS), the
company’s shared services unit, is one of the four pillars of P&G’s corporate
structure. Originally an evolution of the company’s IT unit, GBS
today provides more than 170 shared services and solutions from six
hubs to over three hundred P&G brands globally. In its thirteen years
of operation, it has reduced the cost of shared services by 33 percent and
Governing the Transformation 135
halved the time to market for new products.3 The unit is led by Filippo
Passerini, group president of GBS, who also serves as P&G’s CIO.
Establishing Digital Leadership
Passerini’s dual role gives him a unique perspective on technology and
its impact on business: “For us, technology is never the starting point.
Technology is the enabling tool. The real driver for business transformation
is a change in work processes, business processes or culture—in
the way employees work and operate, rather than the technology per se.
We prefer to be technology agnostic.”4 He proved himself as a leader
of GBS not only by improving the unit’s performance and increasing
its scope of responsibilities, but also by elevating its strategic role in
the organization. According to Passerini, “The mantra in our organization
is that we wake up every morning with the idea that, today, we are
working to become distinctive—and not become a commodity. If we
become a commodity, then it would be all about cost.”5 To do this, he
explained, “We think you need to start with the end in mind of what
is the business value, and then work backwards into all the steps that
unequivocally lead to that business value creation.”6
When McDonald announced his new digital vision, Passerini was
a natural choice as its leader. According to McDonald, “IT is the key
enabling function in delivering our digitization strategy.”7 As head of
IT and GBS, Passerini could mobilize the capabilities and relationships
of GBS to meet the digital challenge. He became the company’s
de facto chief digital officer (CDO). As McDonald explained, “He
is a group president of a business, not just a functional leader, a key
member of our P&G leadership, and the one I hold accountable for the
delivery of this all-important [digitization] strategy.”8
Building a Digital Services Unit
GBS is responsible for leading the effort to digitize the company, providing
governance, technology, processes, and tools to make P&G’s
136 LEADING DIGITAL
digital vision a reality. The aim is to help the company become simpler,
flatter, faster, and more agile.9
Going digital for Passerini meant building an environment based
on real-time operations. Digital governance was organized around
three key principles: standardize systems, process, and information;
automate to eliminate non-value-added interactions; and Â�accelerate
decision making via real-time information.10 P&G started the journey
by identifying the core processes that the company was running
on—some one hundred processes. In conjunction with business
units, the digital team’s role is to identify transformational improvements
and find combinations of process and technology to make
them happen.11
In P&G’s digital governance model, the centralized team provides
end-to-end services to support the business needs of the operating units
and brands. GBS focused its digital services on four main areas: consumer
engagement, value chain innovation, business intelligence, and
organization development.12 “We manage it like we would the launch
of a new brand, a new product,” Passerini says. He tapped into the
famous brand culture of P&G to structure the roles of the people in the
central unit—naming individual roles as “service managers.” The title
came with clear responsibilities: set internal prices, monitor quality,
and develop innovations. To create digital champions, Passerini also
embedded IT people in various business units and made them accountable
for delivering business results, from saving money to speeding
products to market.13
Governing Technology Innovation
P&G has built a multilayered approach to stay abreast of the fastchanging
digital technology market. New digital technologies can fuel
innovation and improve company performance, but only if applied
in the right places and with the right amount of investment. Every
few years P&G looks at megatrends across the world. These megatrends
are then distilled to identify those that impact P&G’s business.
Governing the Transformation 137
ForÂ€those trends that will have an impact, the organization defines clear
strategies to address them. Only then does the organization choose
technologies to enable those strategies.14 Such an approach closely ties
with Passerini’s management culture. According to Passerini, “I see
myself as a business person who happens to have an interest in—and an
understanding of—technology.”15
For instance, consider how the company addressed a trend toward
accelerating innovation cycles in several sectors. With virtual reality
technology, P&G was not only able to prototype products but also to
show how they would look on a store shelf, increasing the quality of
consumer feedback. Retailers also offered early support for this type
of digital modeling. The digital team provided not only virtual reality
technology, but also any end-to-end services required to deliver an
experiment. It even built a library containing images of products from
both P&G and its competitors. Passerini says, “That is creating a lot of
business value because we get much better quality feedback, and can go
to market faster.”16
Building a Digital Governance Culture
In addition to building the leadership and organizational structures for
digital governance, GBS leaders realized they also needed to evolve the
work culture across P&G. Transparency of data was a key aspect of
competing in the digital age. P&G’s high-tech physical environment,
dubbed “business sphere,” allows leaders to harness massive amounts of
data to make real-time business decisions. The environment constantly
displays data on how P&G is doing around the world. However, as
Passerini admits, the data is not perfect. He says, “We intentionally
put the cart before the horse, because it is a way to force change.”17
AÂ€key aspect of competing in the digital age is the ability of leaders to
be comfortable with a certain level of ambiguity when it comes to digital
initiatives.
That approach has been one of the hallmarks of how P&G governs
its digital initiatives. For instance, Passerini took a risk when he
138 LEADING DIGITAL
introduced digital cockpits—a range of easy-to-read charts that Â�contain
the information that is most relevant to each P&G employee. The
idea was that there would be one shared version of the facts, so people
would stop debating what’s happening and focus on solving problems.
The initial versions failed and had to be re-architected over an
eighteen-month period. However, by January 2012, P&G had 58,000
such cockpits operational with more than 80,000 planned by the end of
2013.18 Such risk-taking was encouraged as an active means of driving
change. Passerini explains, “We take a lot of risk. When there’s a new
idea, rather than talk about it philosophically, we do a pilot for free
with one of the business operating units.”19
Today, P&G is known as a leader in using digital technology to
transform its businesses. McDonald backed his vision of making P&G
the most digitally enabled company in the world by providing funding
to make it happen. But with energy and funding around the vision,
the company needed discipline and capabilities to make it a reality. In
establishing digital governance, Passerini and the GBS team adapted
successful practices where possible and built new capabilities where
needed. Through its governance processes and its resources, GBS is
now an integral part of digitally transforming P&G, from product
development to manufacturing to marketing.
WHY DIGITAL GOVERNANCE IS NEEDED
The word governance derives from the Greek verb kybernan, which
means “to steer.”20 Most companies have strong governance over
finance and human resources. But companies vary in the extent to
which they govern other aspects of their business, such as brandÂ€governance
to ensure consistent and appropriate brand usage, IT
governance to apply technology resources effectively, and vendorÂ€
governance to ensure that purchasing is efficient and compliant
with regulation.
New demands for digital capabilities, and new risks from digital
activities, have made digital governance essential in all companies.
Governing the Transformation 139
ForÂ€ example, social media reduces a firm’s control over its global
brand. A negative customer post on Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube
can receive global attention immediately. Even as companies find new
ways to work with customers through mobile and social channels, the
companies are also paying close attention to their online reputations.
But beyond social media, digital technology makes a firm’s customerfocused
activities more apparent to all, wherever they happen. That’s
why Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts appointed a brand czar to synergize
the use of the iconic company’s brand around the world.21
New technologies can also have unwanted confidentiality and
regulatory consequences. Lost phones and tablets can enable hackers
to invade a network. Employees may post company secrets online or
release information on mergers or company financials in inappropriate
ways. Personal information about credit cards or patient health can find
its way online. Customers may see employees’ personal posts as corporate
advice on investments or health. Any of these breaches can leave
firms liable to reputational damage and millions of dollars in penalties
or regulatory sanctions. As one executive told us, “The last thing we
want to do is put the reputation that we’ve built for a hundred and fifty
years on the line because of a security incident.”
Digital Masters Govern Better
Our research shows that Digital Masters govern digital activities better
than other companies do. Our 2012 survey measured governance capability
as a composite of questions related to clear roles, strategic alignment
of initiatives, cross-unit investment coordination, use of KPIs,
and presence of a high-level transformation roadmap. According to
this measure, Digital Masters govern 51 percent better than nonmasters.
22 The masters are far better at making decisions about what initiatives
to pursue and at steering those initiatives to success.
Our qualitative and quantitative analysis shows that digital governance
is one of the most important levers that senior executives can
apply in driving digital transformation. Governance acts as a set of
140 LEADING DIGITAL
guiderails to keep everybody moving in the right direction. It provides
both carrots and sticks to foster innovation and prevent inappropriate
investment. It helps to manage the risks of transformation and to drive
transformation forward efficiently.
Digital Governance as Opportunity
Digital Masters understand that governance not only prevents problems
but also enables new digital capabilities. Mobile apps, collaboration
networks, connected products, and social media create new
opportunities, from marketing to manufacturing to customer service.
Business cycles are getting faster and faster because of demands from
both customers and employees.23 Governance can help to implement
new solutions faster than ever before, while also managing the challenges
of security, regulatory compliance, and legacy system integration.
It helps companies gain a more integrated view of customers
and operations, collaborate more effectively, and make policy work
better.
For example, as customers demand a more integrated experience
and analytics demands more-integrated data, many companies struggle
to unify their disparate data sources. “Data integration is the biggest
challenge in setting up our digital services,” explained an executive,
echoing statements by many others. Digital Masters use governance to
shape a unified platform for their digital initiatives, from new customer
experiences to automated factories to advanced analytics.
In addition, as companies become more global, they are finding the
need to collaborate more effectively across geographic locations, business
units, and specialties. When employees find their own ways to collaborate
outside the company’s official sanctioned approaches, potential
security, regulatory, and integration challenges can result. Many
companies have used governance to establish official collaboration
platforms for video conferencing, instant messaging, and knowledge
sharing. Companies also use governance to create and enforce policy,
Governing the Transformation 141
stating which types of collaboration are (and are not) appropriate, and
creating monitoring tools to detect policy violations.
Making Digital Governance Work
When designing governance for your digital activities, focus on how
you will achieve two key goals:
• Coordination: Prioritizing, synchronizing, and aligning
Â�initiatives across the enterprise
• Sharing: Using common capabilities and resources (including
people, technology, and data) across the enterprise
In many big companies, coordination and sharing tend to be unnatural
acts. To a manager in a business unit or region, coordination means
endless meetings and unwanted restrictions. Building on shared
resources can make you dependent on the goodwill and delivery capability
of people you do not control. It’s no wonder that organizational
antibodies rise up to defeat new corporate-level governance activities
whenever possible.
Yet, the biggest benefits of digital transformation come exactly
from engaging in unnatural cross-silo acts of coordination and sharing.
According to a senior executive in an international banking group,
“Digital impacts firms globally, across traditional silos. It requires more
coordination when [we are] making decisions and conducting actions,
compared to the way we do business usually. Questions are not local
but global, and so the choices we make engage the company as a whole,
in all countries and business units.”
This is why executives at Nike created a strong digital unit to work
across the firm’s major business units. It’s why Nestlé built its digital
acceleration team. And it’s why you need some mechanisms to ensure
the same benefits. Governance makes up for issues that arise from the
way your company is structured. It encourages employees to follow
Â�certain practices that they wouldn’t do if left to their own devices.
142 LEADING DIGITAL
KEY MECHANISMS FOR
DIGITAL GOVERNANCE
In building your digital governance, think about how you will use three
major governance mechanisms: committees, leadership roles, and
shared digital units. Each mechanism has strengths and weaknesses in
terms of delivering sharing and coordination. And each may be more
or less appropriate to your company’s culture. One of your jobs as an
executive is to choose mechanisms that give the right levels of coordination
and sharing for specific resources, while managing any cultural
conflicts that the new mechanisms create.
Governance Committees
If your company has been paying attention to the rapid pace of technology
change, you have probably already established executive-level committees
to govern some digital activities. Committees are a relatively
easy way to get started on coordination. Unfortunately, they rarely provide
enough governance—especially in companies where not all units
are on board with the digital vision.
Steering committees are most common. These groups, consisting
of some of the most senior executives in the company, make decisions
such as ratifying policies, prioritizing competing interests, and killing
low-value projects. Through their power to set policy and allocate
resources, steering committees can help the enterprise to act in a unified
way. Volvo, for example, has a strong committee to steer the launch
of its connected-cars concept. The committee helps to align activities
across engineering and manufacturing units and to set policy to address
dealers’ concerns that the corporation is starting to talk directly with
customers.24
Steering committees can also make the case for investments that
business units might not undertake on their own. An example is a manufacturing
company’s investment in a global customer platform: “This
investment was primarily based on what I would call an ‘art business
Governing the Transformation 143
case,’ rather than the ‘science business case,’ and this was the right
thing to do,” explained a senior executive. “We did it big enough to be
successful, but small enough to not be stupid.”
Some companies also create innovation committees to govern emerging
technology. The committees don’t do the work of innovation; they
play a policy and oversight role. Innovation committees identify challenges
that can be resolved through innovation, fund experiments and
pilots, and consider how to adopt useful innovations.
Northwestern Mutual established an innovation committee to stay
ahead of and respond to constantly changing demands from the firm’s
independent financial representatives. As representatives started to use
tablets and social media, the committee investigated how to use this
technology in a way that was efficient, secure, and aligned with regulatory
requirements. The goal of the committee is not to prevent unwanted
action, but rather to help the company innovate safely with new technologies
and processes. According to an executive, “We cannot be slow
to think about these technologies because our field force adopts them
quickly. We have regulatory concerns that we have to deal with, and we
have training and education challenges. We need people with different
perspectives talking together about these emerging technologies.”25
The innovation committee helps to choose technology standards
and set policy before investing in capabilities that will be shared across
the company. An executive explained: “We are bringing together all the
people who can say, ‘Wow, we could do this. It’s not a problem.’ That’s
our IT architects. And then we’ve got everybody else saying, ‘Well, if
we do this, how do we protect confidentiality? How do we retain data?
How do we train? What’s it going to take to make this usable before we
officially condone its use in the field?’ So, it brings all of the right levels
of perspective to the table.”26
Digital Leadership Roles
Committees can make decisions, but they cannot drive change. Leaders
do that. New leadership roles include chief digital officers (CDOs),
144 LEADING DIGITAL
who lead digital transformation at the enterprise or business level, and
less senior liaison roles.
Chief Digital Officers
In March 2012, Starbucks appointed Adam Brotman as its first CDO,
reporting directly to the CEO. According to Brotman, digital “has
been an essential part of how we build our brand and connect with our
customers .Â€.Â€. [T]here’s been such a seismic shift [in our interactions
with customers] that we needed to pull it all together and make it a
priority.”27
The CDO’s job is to turn a digital cacophony into a symphony. He
or she creates a unifying digital vision, energizes the company around
digital possibilities, coordinates digital activities, helps to rethink products
and processes for the digital age, and sometimes provides critical
tools or resources. Such a leader may do this alone or with help from
committees or digital units.
Some CDOs have responsibility only to establish a vision and
coordinate digital activities. These tasks are relatively workable in most
companies, since they offer little threat to autonomous managers. We
often see more-junior people in this type of CDO role. They make
suggestions and create energy, but often must rely on others to drive
real change.
However, many CDOs are also charged with creating synergies
and driving transformation. These tasks can be much more difficult
in companies that have a history of decentralization and autonomy.
When this type of CDO role is created, organizational antibodies rise
up to attack it. Local unit chiefs may reject what they see as unnecessary
interference from a role they consider illegitimate. That’s why a
strong CDO role requires a respected leader. And it requires strong
communication from the top of the firm that the CDO role—and its
authority—is real.
At Starbucks, Brotman has responsibility for web and mobile communications,
including social media; Starbucks cards and loyalty programs;
in-store Wi-Fi and the Starbucks Digital Network; and the
Governing the Transformation 145
company’s in-store digital and entertainment teams. He earned respect
from his prior positions in the company, and he has the CEO as his
chief supporter.
At Volvo, the firm hired a seasoned senior executive to take responsibility
for its connected-cars concept. With the support of a strong
senior executive steering committee, he drives coordination and sharing
across silos such as product design, manufacturing, marketing, and
after-sales service.
You may or may not want to appoint a new C-level executive to
manage digital transformation. But the responsibilities of the CDO
will be required. You may appoint a temporary CDO to get your house
in order, or you may develop other ways to get the job done. Whatever
approach you choose, you need to create appropriate levels of digital
technology synergy, brand integration, investment coordination, skill
development, vendor management, and innovation over the long term.
Digital Liaisons
Official liaison roles, such as the digital champions we mentioned in
the previous chapter, can steer digital transformation at a local level.
Members of Nestlé’s digital acceleration team play an informal governance
role by being part of the conversation in their units and sharing
practices across units.28 But large companies often require a stronger
liaison role—one that acts as a mini-CDO for each business unit.
When the CEO of PRISA decided to establish digital governance,
he hired a group-level CDO. This CDO built the company’s shared
digital unit, led the development and rollout of a global content management
system, and set direction for most digitally related questions.
In PRISA’s highly decentralized corporate culture, the group CDO
had limited authority to drive change in each of the company’s media
properties around the world. Instead, the CEO mandated that each
property appoint its own CDO. These local CDOs, who were Â�typically
very senior managers from the unit, had the mandate to lead digital
transformation in their divisions while coordinating with the group
CDO and each other.29
146 LEADING DIGITAL
Shared Digital Units
Committees can decide, and leaders can drive change. But implementing
change sometimes requires a centralized set of expertise and
resources. Digital units, like those developed by P&G, Nike, and
PRISA, are a very effective way to govern and drive digital transformation.
Digital units vary in size and role, but all have a common goal to
drive synergy across the firm. Some digital units help business units
conduct digital initiatives, while others conduct all digital initiatives for
the business units. All have resources such as skills, infrastructure, and
financing that can be shared across the firm.
Digital units can do what committees and leaders can’t do on
their own. They can create shared infrastructure such as unified customer
databases, an enterprise wireless platform, advanced analytics
teams, and innovation labs. A senior executive in a global insurance
group explained: “It would not make sense for the different entities of
the group to develop all the digital stuff themselves. It costs time and
money and requires coordination. And by doing it themselves, they
would not benefit from the experience gained across the company.”
Building some digital infrastructure and skills centrally creates an
incentive for local units to go along with the new standard. The decision
moves from “How much would it cost us to do this on our own?”
to “How can we get the most out of the central platform?” “How can
we leverage these capabilities as much as possible?” At PRISA, for
example, the digital unit was essential in creating a global contentmanagement
system. The leaders of each media outlet did not have
incentives to invest in the system, but the enterprise-level effort created
a system that all outlets can use. Through the new system, journalists in
each media outlet can store, track, and share media such as text, audio
interviews, and video clips with other PRISA outlets around the world.
Some digital units provide specialized digital expertise to the rest of
the company. When we interviewed 150 executives about digital transformation,
the most important barrier they identified was missing skills.
Among the companies we studied, 77 percent cited skill challenges in
Governing the Transformation 147
areas such as mobility, analytics, and social media.30 The companies
are actively recruiting experts in these areas, with varying degrees of
success. Hosting these skills in the digital unit allows the company to
recruit the right experts and use them across the firm. Many units also
build skills through training and knowledge sharing, as we discuss in
chapter 12.
Digital units can exercise power and influence beyond what morelightweight
committees and leadership roles can do. But don’t go into
them lightly. Digital units require significant investment in resources
and management attention. For example, Nike’s digital unit plays a
role in digital activities across the firm. It cooperates in marketing and
other initiatives and provides key skills. It contains a set of innovation
groups to clarify the future vision, identify new technological opportunities,
and build new capabilities. It also serves as the home for digital
products. Doing all of this in a company as fast-moving and entrepreneurial
as Nike required a strong mandate from the top, hiring seasoned
leaders to run different functions, and many millions of dollars
per year. But its impact has made the investment worthwhile.
FINDING THE BEST GOVERNANCE
MECHANISMS FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION
To design governance for your organization, start with the behaviors
you want to encourage. What do you need to coordinate? What sharing
do you want to encourage? Consider how well your organization will
do these on its own, or how you might foster any “unnatural acts” you
need.
Highly decentralized organizations may need strong central governance
to ensure sharing and coordination, but may be able to use less
stringent governance to oversee local innovation. Highly bureaucratic
or centralized organizations may find coordination and sharing to be
more natural, but may need some extra help to innovate or to transform
their processes.
148 LEADING DIGITAL
Each governance mechanism has its strengths and weaknesses
(table 7.1). Additionally, some mechanisms may fit naturally with your
organization’s culture, while others will require strong top-down effort
to implement.
Shared digital units can create strong synergies around infrastructure,
tools, standards, and capabilities. When digital units work, they
accelerate innovation and drive efficiency. They can pool together
funding, digital tools, and people with specific skills to develop digital
services for all units in the company. Some coordination also comes
naturally as the units develop technology standards and implement

Typical benefits and
challenges
Shared digital units Sharing is the main objective,
by pooling specialized
resources and providing
infrastructure.
Standards and policies created
by the unit provide some
coordination and sharing.
However, stronger coordination
of digital initiatives
requires additional
mechanisms.
Benefits: new digital skills,
shared digital services, economies
of scale.
Challenges: structure and
positioning in the organization,

with local unit leaders, definition
of the service catalog.
Governance committees Coordination is the primary
goal.
However, some decisions and
policies may mandate Â�sharing
of specific resources and
capabilities.

and policies, resource optimization,
adoption of new digital
trends.
Challenges: additional mechanisms
often required to lead
transformation or to enforce
standards and policies.
Digital leadership roles These roles drive sharing by
encouraging the use of key
digital resources. They also
assist coordination across
different initiatives and organizational
units.
Benefits: shared digital vision,
culture change, Â�stronger
policy compliance.
Challenges: responsibility
and authority, relationship
between corporate and local
units, coordination between
levels.

Table 7.1
Digital governance mechanisms have their strengths and weaknesses
Governing the Transformation 149
policies governing use of their services. However, challenges exist in
defining the right structure and positioning in the organization. Even
if positioned correctly, the unit can adopt an inward focus, losing touch
with the needs of different business units. In addition, there can be
funding and coordination difficulties, especially if executives in some
part of the organization see the unit as a threat to their autonomy.
Governance committees aim for coordination: making investment
decisions, prioritizing resources, and establishing policies and standards.
The goal is to synchronize activities across the firm without adding
a lot of bureaucracy. When they work, these committees can keep
everyone moving in the same direction. However, they tend to be limited
to decision making, not doing. Lacking a staff, they have a limited
ability to manage activities closely, or to create new things. Additional
mechanisms are often required to lead transformation or to enforce
standards and policies.
Digital leadership roles can drive sharing by helping local units
know when (and how) to adopt firm-level solutions or use centralized
resources. These roles also coordinate across different initiatives and
organizational units. When they work, the roles can ensure that the
digital vision is shared across the enterprise. They can foster culture
change, improve policy enforcement, and ease the transition to new
ways of working. However, these roles have challenges too. If senior
executives do not take the roles seriously, they may staff them with
people who do not have the seniority or influence to be successful.
Another challenge is inherent in the role itself. Liaisons need to balance
the interests of both the enterprise and the business unit. This can
be very difficult to do consistently and without bias, especially if you
physically sit in one area or the other.
TAKE STEPS NOW TO BUILD
DIGITAL GOVERNANCE
Digital governance should not be left to chance. Ineffective governance
creates waste and missed opportunities, making digital transformation
150 LEADING DIGITAL
riskier and costlier than it needs to be. Governance requires conscious
design and engagement by the company’s most senior executives. The
right governance model provides appropriate levels of coordination and
sharing for digital initiatives, in line with the company’s structure, culture,
and strategic priorities. No single governance model is optimal for
all companies, but lack of governance is never optimal.
Your digital governance model will use combinations of the three
mechanisms for different activities and at different levels of the organization.
Executives at Nike chose to build governance around a new digital
unit, along with a steering committee and new roles. Asian Paints used a
steering committee, but considered the IT unit its digital unit, with the
CIO playing the role of CDO. Nestlé built a digital acceleration team
and digital champion roles, but not a steering committee. Northwestern
Mutual built committees but not a digital unit or new roles.
Whatever you choose, remember one thing: governance models
should not be static. You will need to adjust your governance arrangements
as your digital capabilities grow and your competitive situation
changes. You can understand when it is time to revisit your governance
models by paying attention to the behaviors governance is intended to
enhance and by adjusting governance to encourage new behaviors. You
may find you need to create more centralized control over your digital
activities or may need to build additional capabilities in your digital
unit. Or, as coordination and sharing become part of the culture, you
may devolve much of your governance to business units.

LEADERSHIP
CAPABILITIES
We are stronger when we listen,
and smarter when we share.
—Rania Al-Abdullah
If, before you had read this book, we asked you to think about what
makes leadership work, you would probably have thought of vision,
governance, and engagement (among other things). These three tools
are essential to guide any kind of major transformation.1 But another
essential element of digital leadership capabilities is not necessarily
something you might think of as leadership. It’s the strong relationship
that Digital Masters encourage between their IT and business leaders,
and the way these companies use that relationship to drive change
in their internal platforms and digital skills. These are what we call
Â�technology leadership capabilities, and they are essential for driving
transformation that is based on digital technology.
154 LEADING DIGITAL
TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP AT
LLOYDS BANKING GROUP
Lloyds Banking Group (LBG), based in London, is one of the
world’s largest banks, with more than $1 trillion in assets. In 2006,
LBG executives began to understand that their existing online retail
platform, while working well, could not scale to the new demands
that the company was going to place on it in the future. Soon after,
a merger with Halifax Bank of Scotland made the situation more
pressing, as it would add millions more customers to the strained
system.
The executive team asked a senior business executive, Ashley
Machin, and a senior IT executive, Zak Mian, to rethink the company’s
approach to digital retail banking. The pair knew each other only
in passing, but soon developed a strong working relationship. Starting
small, they put together a plan to replace the old platform with a new,
more scalable one—a true foundational investment for the company’s
future digital strategy. This first step was the start of a partnership that
began to transform nearly all of the bank’s digital customer engagements,
and then more.
Machin described how the transformation began:
The senior-most leadership of the bank did something pretty
Â�courageous, which you cannot traditionally do. We looked at
what we wanted to achieve, and we looked at the Â�infrastructure
we Â�currently had. And our recommendation was, “Do you
know what? We’re going to spend the first couple of years just
Â�building and completing new infrastructure.” And the only
Â�customer Â�benefits at the end of that new infrastructure will be a
Â�fundamentally redesigned user interface and hence user experience.
And we will have a state-of-the-art platform, which will enable
us to respond far more quickly to customers.
We did the pitch, and the bank supported a program that said,
“Let’s build a foundation that will last us for decades to come.”
Building Technology Leadership Capabilities 155
That’s a huge up-front investment with no real return in a
Â�traditional sense. The only return was that it puts you in a
Â�position to be able to roll out customer processes and offers in
a way the competition can’t.2
In addition to rethinking the platform, the two leaders also
rethought the way IT and business worked together. Understanding
that their team needed to work faster than traditional IT development
processes could, they created a new unit that merged both IT
and business talents. Instead of business providing the requirements
and IT delivering the technology, people from both sides of the house
worked together to innovate the company’s processes. The team took
Â�responsibility not only for delivering technology, but also for ensuring
the business changes that would be necessary to deliver the expected
benefits. Machin and Mian hired staff from inside and outside the
company, built a team with system development consultants in India
and the UK, and went to work.
Once the basic platform was in place, the team started to take on
new challenges such as credit card processing. Mian explained: “We
had extended the platform for retail and also commercial, and then
it was absolutely time to reenergize the transformation agenda rather
than the re-platforming agenda.” Demand took off, and leaders of
many units—from credit cards to mortgages to commercial products—
asked for help in digitally transforming their businesses.
Looking back, Machin said, “One of the regular questions I get
is, ‘How have you managed to get such an integrated and symbiotic
relationship between IT and business?’ And quite simply, I think the
answer is, you need to have a shared passion for the outcomes you want,
and to have a highly trusting relationship that you are both determined
to do the right thing for the customers and [to] be slightly agnostic, for
want of a better word, about how you get there.”
The strong IT–business partnership and the ability to deliver great
digital customer experiences, ROI, and flexible technology has paid off
for the team and the company. In 2013, CEO António Horta-Osório
156 LEADING DIGITAL
recognized that the group had a further opportunity to strengthen and
accelerate the company’s plans and to develop digital propositions
across all customer-facing divisions in the group. In September 2013,
Â�Horta-Osório made “head of digital” a group Â�executive-Â�committee-level
appointment, reporting directly to him, creating a new digital division
under Miguel-Ángel Rodríguez-Sola, the director for digital,
marketing, and customer development. This digital unit, now more
than a thousand people strong, moved into a new dedicated location.
Commenting on future plans, Mian added, “What gives me confidence
is that although we know we need to continue to adapt and learn,
the shared agenda and integration of business and IT teams is now in
our DNA.”
THREE ELEMENTS OF TECHNOLOGY
LEADERSHIP CAPABILITY
As the Lloyds story shows, technology leadership is not just about IT
leaders, although they are part it. It’s not just about technical skills,
although they’re essential. It’s about merging the skills and perspectives
of business and IT leaders so that they drive transformation
together.
When the IT–business relationship is strong, IT people can suggest
new opportunities, and businesspeople listen. Businesspeople have
an instinct for the problems that poor technical decisions can Â�create,
so they make better decisions, with no need for the CIO to lecture
them on standards and procedures. IT and business groups are able to
move faster together than they could separately, so they can Â�conduct
Â�experiments, launch new capabilities, and transform outdated Â�platforms
better than other companies can.
In talking about technology leadership, therefore, we won’t just
focus on the leaders’ relationship. We’ll also look at what they do with
that relationship—building digital skills and transforming the technology
platform that underpins all digital processes, from customer
engagement to operations to business models.

THE IMPORTANCE OF STRONG
IT–BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS
Many executives told us that, given their IT units’ poor performance,
they were going to find a different way to conduct their digital transformations.
The business executives were going to move forward despite
their IT units, not with them. We did not find this to be true with
Digital Masters, which have much stronger IT–business relationships
than nonmasters do. In our research, the precise measure we used was a
well-known concept from the IT research literature: shared understanding.
3 The concept is a composite of four survey items that assess the
extent to which IT and business executives share a view of the role of
IT in the organization, including its potential in improving productivity
and serving as a competitive weapon, as well as a common view
of prioritization. Digital Masters averaged a statistically significant (32
percent) higher level of shared understanding than nonmasters did.4
Shared understanding is the starting point for larger changes in the
IT–business relationship and the nature of IT itself. In Digital Masters,
IT and business executives have deep trust and respect for each other.
They are also very clear on their roles as they work together to make
digital transformation happen. This translates to what they can do.
Digital Masters reported feeling 21 percent higher control over their
destiny than nonmasters, a difference that is also statistically significant.
5 By working together, these leaders can do what they need, and
they can get more done. Their companies’ digital skills are higher, and
the state of their digital platform is better than in nonmaster firms.
When the relationship is strong, the IT–business Â�partnership
merges customer and product knowledge, technical knowledge,
Â�organizational change capabilities, and IT capabilities into a single,
continuous collaboration. Unfortunately, in many companies, the
Â�relationship seems to be more like a troubled marriage than a smoothly
functioning partnership.6 Conversations are full of conflict, and little
collaboration takes place. The poor relationship serves as a handicap
that can slow action and increase the risk of change.
158 LEADING DIGITAL
The Causes of Poor IT–Business Relationships
Poor relationships between IT and business leaders can have many
causes. Sometimes it’s the personality of the IT leader. A common
complaint among senior executives is that their CIO seems to speak a
Â�different language from the business. Another is that the CIO doesn’t
seem to understand what’s really important. For example, a Â�chemical
company CIO we interviewed described how he communicates
Â�regularly with business executives about the innovative possibilities of
digital technologies. Yet none of his business executive peers (whom
we interviewed separately) seemed to find the discussions credible.
Sometimes the issue arises from IT’s delivery capability. According
to Bud Mathaisel, who has served as CIO in several large companies,
“It starts with competence in delivering services reliably, economically,
and at very high quality. It is the absolute essential to be even invited
into meaningful dialog about how you then build on that competence
to do something very interesting with it.”7 Unfortunately, some IT
units today do not have this competence. One business executive we
interviewed said, “IT is a mess. Its costs are not acceptable. It proposes
things in nine or ten months, where external firms could do them in
three to nine weeks. We started offshoring our IT, and now our IT
guys are trying to change.” A legacy of poor communication, byzantine
decision processes, and broken commitments is no foundation on
which to build a strong IT–business relationship.
However, the fault doesn’t always rest only with IT leaders. In
many cases, business executives share some of the blame. As we’ll
show later in this chapter, high-performing IT requires a good digital
platform, and good platforms require discipline. If your approach
to working with IT can be characterized by impatience, unreasonable
expectations, or insisting on doing things your way, then you’ll need to
think about how to change your side of the relationship.
Regardless of the cause, if your IT–business relationships are poor,
it’s essential to fix the problem. A bank executive stated, “IT has been
brought closer to business during the last five years. It is very important
Building Technology Leadership Capabilities 159
to success because many of the important transformations in our
Â�business are enabled by technology.” With strong relationships, IT
executives can help business executives meet their goals, and business
executives listen when IT people suggest innovations. Executives on
both sides are willing to be flexible in creating new governance mechanisms
or shared digital units. At Codelco, Asian Paints, and P&G, the
CIO even leads digital transformation for the company.
Improving the IT–Business Relationship
So, how can you start to improve your IT–business relationship?
Angela Ahrendts, CEO of Burberry, told her CIO he needed to help
drive the bus with the executive team.8 However, leadership changes
or top-down mandates are only the start of the change. Few CIOs can
change the business by themselves, and not all business executives will
climb on the bus with the CIO, even if the CEO demands it.
Fixing the IT–business relationship can take time, as people learn
how to trust each other and redefine the way they work together. As
with any struggling relationship, the best starting point is to fix the way
you communicate. Does IT really cost too much, or are costs reasonable,
given what IT has to do? Is the IT unit really too bureaucratic,
or do all of those procedures actually serve a useful purpose? Are you
a good partner to IT or a difficult one? How can IT make it easier for
you to get what you need, while still making sure things are done correctly?
What investments can help IT improve its technology, internal
processes, cost-effectiveness, quality, or speed?9
MIT research into IT turnarounds has identified a series of
steps that can change IT from a poorly respected cost center to a
Â�high-functioning business partner.10 The key change mechanism is
transparency—around performance, roles, and value. The first step is to
help IT employees think, and talk, differently about what they do. The
second step proceeds to showing very clearly how well (or how poorly)
IT delivers value for money—the right services at the right quality and
right price, and where problems still exist. And then the third step
160 LEADING DIGITAL
moves to changing the way IT and business leaders make Â�investment
decisions and assess the returns that projects deliver. Through transparency
around roles, performance, and investments, both sides can
make smoother decisions and work together to identify and deliver
innovations.
Creating Dual-Speed IT
Changing the IT–business relationship is well worth the effort, but
doing so takes time. Your company may not have the time to wait
before starting your digital transformation. Rather than improving the
IT unit, some companies try to build digital skills into another unit,
such as marketing. They try to work around IT rather than with it.
Although building digital skills is useful, trying to work around IT
can be fraught with challenges, especially if people do not understand
the reasons for IT’s systematic, if sometimes ponderous, processes.
This kind of flanking action can waste money, make the digital platform
more complex, and, even worse, open the company to security
and regulatory risks.
A better approach is to create a dual-speed IT structure, where one
part of the IT unit continues to support traditional IT needs, while
another takes on the challenge of operating at digital speed with the
business. Digital activities—especially in customer engagement—move
faster than many traditional IT ones. They look at design processes
differently. Where IT projects have traditionally depended on clear
designs and well-structured project plans, digital activities often engage
in test-and-learn strategies, trying features in real-life experiments and
quickly adding or dropping them based on what they find.
In a dual-speed approach, the digital unit can develop processes and
methods at clock-speeds more closely aligned with the digital world,
without losing sight of the reasons that the old IT processes existed. IT
leaders can draw on informal relationships within the IT department
to get access to legacy systems or make other changes happen. Business
leaders can use their networks to get input and resources. Business and
Building Technology Leadership Capabilities 161
IT leaders can even start to work together in the kind of two-in-a-box
leadership method that LBG and other companies have adopted.
Building dual-speed IT units requires choosing the right leaders
on both sides of the relationship. Business executives need to be
comfortable with technology and with being challenged by their IT
counterparts. IT leaders need to have a mind-set that extends beyond
technology to encompass the processes and drivers of business performance.
Leaders from both sides need to be strong communicators
who can slide easily between conversations with either business- or
IT-focused people.
Dual-speed IT also requires perspective about the value of speed.
Not all digital efforts need the kind of fast-moving, constantly changing
processes that digital customer-engagement processes can need.
In fact, the underlying technology elements that powered LBG’s new
platform, Asian Paints’ operational excellence, and Nike’s digital supply
chain enhancements required the careful, systematic thinking that
underpins traditional IT practices. Doing these big implementations
in a loose learning-by-doing method could be dangerous. It could
increase rework, waste money, and introduce security risks. But once
the strong digital platform is there, building new digital capabilities
can be fast, agile, and innovative. The key is to understand what you
need in each type of project and how much room any project has to
be flexible and agile. Great IT leaders know how to do this. If teamed
with the right business leaders, they can make progress quickly and
safely.
Dual-speed IT also takes new processes inside IT. Few digital
businesses have the luxury to wait for monthly software release cycles
for all of their applications. Digital-image hosting business Flickr, for
example, aims for up to ten deployments per day, while some businesses
require even more.11 This continuous-deployment approach
requires very tight discipline and collaboration between development,
test, and operations people. A bug in software, missed step in testing,
or configuration problem in deployment can bring down a web site or
affect thousands of customers.
162 LEADING DIGITAL
A relatively new software-development method called DevOps
aims to make this kind of disciplined speed possible. It breaks down
silos between development, operations, and quality assurance groups,
allowing them to collaborate more closely and be more agile. When
done properly, DevOps improves the speed and reliability of application
development and deployment by standardizing development
environments. It uses strong methods and standards, including synchronizing
the tools used by each group.12
DevOps relies heavily on automated tools to do tasks in testing,
configuration control, and deployment—tasks that are both slow and
error-prone when done manually. Companies that use DevOps need
to foster a culture where different IT groups can work together and
where workers accept the rules and methods that make the process
effective.13 The discipline, tools, and strong processes of DevOps can
help IT release software more rapidly and with fewer errors, as well as
monitor performance and resolve process issues more effectively, than
before.14
Whether your CIO takes it upon himself or herself to improve the
IT–business relationship, or you decide to help make it happen, forging
a strong link between business and IT executives is an essential part
of driving digital transformation. Strong IT–business relationships can
transform the way IT works and the way the business works with it.
Through trust and shared understanding, your technology and business
experts can collaborate closely, like at LBG, to innovate your business
at digital speeds. Without this kind of relationship, your company may
become mired in endless requirements discussions, failing projects, and
lackluster systems, while your competitors accelerate past you in the
digital fast lane.
BUILDING DIGITAL SKILLS
Creating great customer experiences or market-leading operational
capabilities is more than a technology challenge. It’s also an organizational
change challenge requiring new skills and new ways of working.
Building Technology Leadership Capabilities 163
Yet, 77 percent of companies in our first year of research cited missing
digital skills as a major hurdle to their digital transformation success.15
To compound the problem, most companies are chasing after similar
skills—social media analysts, mobile marketers, cloud architects, or
data scientists, to name a few.
How Digital Masters Are Building Skills
So what are Digital Masters doing differently when it comes to
skills? First, they are investing. Of the Digital Masters we surveyed,
82 Â�percent are building the digital skills they need to support their digital
transformation efforts. Only 40 percent of nonmasters are doing so.
Second, Digital Masters are accelerating and creating a gap. Our
survey research shows that the masters had greater digital skills than
nonmasters, reporting 31 percent higher social media skills, 38 percent
higher mobile skills, and 19 percent higher analytics skills.16
But Digital Masters did not start with higher skills. Burberry did
not become excellent at digital marketing and channels overnight.
CEO Ahrendts hired a new, dynamic marketing team whose members
mirrored the behaviors of the millennial customer.17 Nor did Caesars
excel at delivering personalized customer experience solely because its
CEO, Gary Loveman, has a PhD in economics from MIT. Caesars’
executives actively incorporated quantitative skills into the marketing
area. In these companies, like other Digital Masters, top executives
worked hard to build the digital skills they needed.
The skills difference extends beyond technology. Digital Masters
report 36 percent higher skills in digital leadership than nonmasters.18
Digital transformation requires changes to processes and Â�thinking—
changes that span your internal organizational silos. The clear delineation
between technical skills and leadership skills is blurring fast.
The impact of digital technologies is now felt not only in the IT
and technical departments, but also across the entire organization.
Digital transformation’s need for cross-functional collaboration creates
a huge demand for hybrid digital skills—technical people who need
164 LEADING DIGITAL
to be more business savvy and businesspeople who need to be more
Â�technology savvy. A retail executive explained: “We are trying for the
first time to work across the company. That implies going through a
new level of complexity in the organization, and requires people to
manage and network differently. That, I think, is the most important
skill that needs to be developed.”
The need for new skills can also result from the need to bridge the
communication gap between digital and business competences. One
executive said, “I need a charismatic quant—somebody who’s an influencer
and can carry his weight in a senior meeting, but at the same
time, someone who can roll up his sleeves and look at data tables and
build models and enjoy it.”
These bridging roles may soon become the responsibility of every
manager. “I believe,” said Markus Nordlin, CIO of Zurich Insurance,
“that the successful leaders of tomorrow, in any business or industry,
are going to be true hybrid professionals who have spent some time in
IT but have shifted to operations and vice-versa.”19
A Two-Pronged Arms Race for Digital Skills
Aspiring Digital Masters are all chasing the same technical skills. The
shortage of digital skills in the current marketplace is unprecedented.
In Europe alone, forecasts point to nearly a million vacancies for
IT-related roles by 2015.20 And globally, out of the 4.4 million big-data
jobs to be created by 2015, only a third will be filled.21
But by the same token, business professionals will increasingly
need to be comfortable with digital tools and technologies to perform
their core roles. By 2015, research firm IDC expects that 90 percent
of all jobs will require IT skills.22 Some business functions are already
adding technology skills to their mix. Gartner reports that 70 percent
of the companies they surveyed have a chief marketing technologist to
support the digitization of the function.23
This skills race won’t slow down anytime soon. Having the right
digital skills is an important source of competitive advantage and a key
Building Technology Leadership Capabilities 165
enabler of digital transformation. Companies that build skills faster
will get ahead.
To win at the digital skills race, you will need to tap into multiple
approaches—hiring, partnering, incubating, and the like. It’s not easy,
as one executive explained: “Our recruiters don’t know where to go to
find these people, and people with the right skills don’t look to our kind
of company for opportunities.” HR organizations will need to get up
to speed quickly. A recent Capgemini Consulting survey found that
only 30 percent of HR functions were actively involved in digital skills
development.24 This needs to change. Many Digital Masters have a
carefully crafted plan to fight and win the talent race. In chapter 12,
we’ll show you how to do this.
THE DIGITAL PLATFORM AS A
LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE
Our research confirms a wide body of research in the IT Â�management
field: the most fundamental technology foundation for digital
Â�transformation is a strong digital platform—well structured, well
Â�integrated, and only as complex as absolutely necessary.25 We’ve seen
this in case after case. Burberry fixed its IT backbone before it could
transform customer engagement. Asian Paints created a unified platform
before transforming operations. LBG reengineered its digital
platform before expanding its digital services. The growth and innovativeness
of Â�Seven-Eleven Japan rides largely on the real-time visibility
that its unified operational platform provides. Well-structured digital
platforms are the foundation for new digital business models such as
Nike+, Airbnb, and Hailo.
If this is true, then why do so many large companies have poorly
designed technology platforms? Large companies often operate in silos,
each with its own systems, data definitions, and business processes. The
systems are confusing, sometimes duplicative, and often tied together
in complex (and sometimes unknown) ways. Generating a common
view of customers or products can be very difficult.
166 LEADING DIGITAL
Every request for a nonstandard technology, every demand to do
things your own way, every choice to go around corporate governance
processes so you can move faster, and every integration meeting that
your staff people miss will create more complexity. Sometimes that
complexity is necessary, but often it is not. According to the head of the
disability business for a major insurer, “We have, through the last fifty
years, proliferated our IT systems and applications. We don’t retire systems.
We just add on top of them, which creates a tremendous amount
of expense and complexity.”26
Technologists have a term for this type of systems arrangement:
legacy spaghetti. Companies mired in legacy spaghetti find it difficult
to make sense of their information and even more difficult to make
change happen.27 Research shows that unnecessary complexity in the
platform is the number one driver of IT risk in firms; it makes processes
harder to change, harder to test, more prone to fail, and tougher
to restore after it fails.28 Spaghetti happens only because leaders let it
happen. And removing spaghetti requires strong leadership.
The Power of a Strong Digital Platform
A well-designed digital platform is one reason that web-based
Â�companies are able to perform analytics and personalization much more
readily than traditional firms.29 Amazon.com, knowing everything you
have purchased over many years, can make good recommendations for
what you might buy next. Facebook and Google, knowing what you
have written and read in the past, can target advertising to you much
more effectively than can less informed firms.
But this capability is not limited to born-digital companies. The
personalization and mobile capabilities at Caesars are built on its
Â�unified Total Rewards database, which records all interactions the
company has with each customer. At Codelco, the unified digital view
of its mines allows the firm to synchronize operations smoothly while
identifying ways to innovate its processes.
Building Technology Leadership Capabilities 167
To understand platform quality for the firms in our survey, we asked
respondents the extent to which they had an integrated view of different
aspects of their firms. Digital Masters average 17 percent higher
than nonmasters for integrated views of operational performance
andÂ€supply-chain status.30 Beyond operations, the difference was even
higher. Digital Masters average 25 percent higher than nonmasters for
integrated views of customer data and 26 percent higher for integrated
views of product or service performance.
If you don’t have a common view of customers, it’s extremely difficult
to accomplish advanced customer-engagement techniques such as
personalized service or location-based marketing. The challenge grows
as you engage in multichannel operations. As a marketing executive
said, “It’s very difficult to get a good understanding of the customer
when customer data is spread across so many systems.”
For many traditional companies, the first step in preparing for
digital transformation is to invest—sometimes heavily—in integrating
data and processes across the enterprise. In this respect, firms that have
already implemented ERP and CRM systems are a step ahead of others.
Burberry’s transformation required much more than digitally enabling
stores or starting to do social media marketing. The company needed
to invest millions into an ERP system that could help the company
become digital end-to-end. Through unified systems and Â�processes,
Burberry could improve operations, understand sales Â�patterns, and start
to provide seamless service across channels.
Well-structured platforms can also to help manage the
Â�centralization-versus-decentralization challenge in globalization. At
Caesars, for example, each hotel’s website around the world is served
by a single global platform. Each property’s manager can customize
the site’s content and marketing campaigns locally, while headquarters
supports the technology for all sites. Global media company PRISA’s
content management system means that a soccer video clip recorded in
Barcelona can easily be used by a TV station in Madrid, a newspaper in
France, and a radio station in Argentina on the same day.
168 LEADING DIGITAL
The Scaling Power of Digital Platforms
Well-structured digital platforms have benefits beyond efficiency and
agility. As we discussed in chapter 3, platforms can help leaders to drive
unwanted variation out of key operations. But good platforms can also
help a company scale volume faster than it needs to scale its labor. And
they can help to roll out innovations quickly across a large and geographically
distributed company.
US pharmacy retailer CVS is an example of how a well-structured
platform can scale not only volume but also new practices. Customer
service levels are a critical measurement in the retail pharmacy business.
So when CVS experienced a decline in customer satisfaction in 2002,
the drop got senior management’s attention. Further analysis uncovered
a key issue: 17 percent of prescription orders experienced delays
from problems with the customers’ insurance. Staff typically checked
insurance after the customer had already left the store, meaning that
problems could not be resolved until the customer returned to pick up
a prescription. Moving the insurance check earlier in the process could
resolve the problem.
CVS embedded the process change into its enterprise pharmacy
fulfillment system, thereby ensuring 100 percent compliance. It was
simply no longer possible to accept a prescription without doing the
insurance check. Through its platform, CVS was able to replicate the
new process throughout its 4,000-plus retail pharmacies within a year.
Performance of the prescription processes improved sharply, driving
customer satisfaction with it. During that year, overall customer satisfaction
scores rose from 86 to 91 percent—a dramatic difference within
the highly competitive retail pharmacy industry.31
Great Digital Platforms Won’t Happen Without Leadership
Great platforms provide clear information to decision makers. They serve
as the bases for advanced analytics capabilities and new digital services.
Building Technology Leadership Capabilities 169
They are both efficient and agile. And they constantly provide new
Â�digital transformation options.
But great platforms don’t just happen. In complex companies,
Â�platforms tend to grow in many directions at once, creating copies,
Â�customizations, and offshoots like so many weeds in a garden. Like
good gardens, good platforms take constant attention to pull weeds, kill
pests, and shape them into beautiful designs. You cannot get a single
view of customers, or an integrated view of operations, without strong,
top-down leadership.
IT leaders can help shape the platform. They can translate the
digital vision into a vision of the technology platforms that will make
it a reality. They can establish management tools such as architecture
reviews to kill weeds and to move the platform in the right direction.
They can adjust technology funding methods to support the right kind
of growth. Intel’s IT unit, for example, increases the priority of projects
that align with the firm’s architectural direction.32 Business unit
requests that that build on the company’s standards are more likely to
be funded than those that don’t.
But IT leaders can have limited ability to force change in Â�business
practices. The typical CIO has little power, on his or her own, to
change the actions of a strong business unit chief. That’s where the
company’s senior-most executives need to play a role. Pages Jaunes
CEO Jean-Pierre Remy did this when he stopped funding updates
to the systems that supported paper-based books. P&G’s digital czar,
Filippo Passerini, uses a more positive approach. He promises business
unit chiefs that his global services unit can reduce the cost of
their purchasing, HR, and other processes by 10 to 30 percent—but
only if they use his standard processes.33
Platform issues are not limited to big incumbent companies. Even
Amazon.com—a company that was born digital—encountered platform
issues. In the 2002 time frame, during a period of rapid growth
and innovation, the firm’s powerful platform began to suffer from a
proliferation of spaghetti and nonstandard designs. It took top-down
170 LEADING DIGITAL
leadership from CEO Jeff Bezos to fix the problem. Bezos issued
a strong mandate that all new development would follow a set of very
clear design rules. The letter ended with this admonition: “Anyone
who doesn’t do this will be fired.” Bezos then empowered a senior executive
to make sure that the mandate was being followed.34 Over the
next several years, the company’s culture of standardization evolved,
and so did its platform. Now, more than ten years later, Amazon.com’s
well-structured digital platform continues to power the firm’s evergrowing
volume of online sales. It has also made possible new business
models, such as Kindle books and streaming video. Amazon.com has
also begun to sell cloud-based infrastructure services to other companies,
transforming Amazon.com’s internal platform into a product of
its own.
The same can happen with your platform. Health insurance
Â�companies are already using their health claims platforms to create
analytics-based products about trends in prescribing and medicine.
A logistics company in China is able to sell forecasts of regional demand
using the trends it has discovered in its historical sales platform.35 And
as Boeing makes its “airline of the future” a reality, it will have a rich
platform, crossing the boundaries of many companies, which it can
mine for new information-based services and products (see chapter 5).
But all of these developments require leadership—to develop the right
platform and skills, to keep them properly aligned, and to capitalize on
the opportunities that they create.
TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP AND YOUR
COMPANY, EVOLVING TOGETHER
Regardless of how you build your platform, our research highlights
an important point. The real value of digital transformation comes
not from the initial investment, but from continuously reenvisioning
how you can extend your capabilities to increase revenue, cut costs, or
Building Technology Leadership Capabilities 171
gain other benefits. Initial investments become the foundation upon
which you can make additional strategic investments. When Asian
Paints first centralized its order-taking processes and implemented
an ERP system, executives did not envision the many successful business
model changes they would be able to make in the future. They
just knew that the unified data and standardized processes would
help the company reach a new level of performance.36 Then, with
unified data and a strong call center, they were able to envision new
things. Â�Mobile-equipped salespeople, armed with up-to-date sales
and order information, could focus on growing the relationship with
each retailer. Call center personnel could do outbound calling to serve
retailers or let them know when a shipping truck would be in their
neighborhood. By delivering to customer work sites instead of retail
stores—a capability none of its competitors had—the company got
closer to its end customers. Then, executives started exporting their
processes to countries outside India.
The firm’s digital foundation provided Asian Paints executives with
options they’d never had before. But the leaders needed to be ready
to seize the opportunity. The company started with business-savvy
IT leadership paired with a business leadership team that understood
the power of IT to change the business. The leaders worked closely
together to make each change to the platform and then let platform
changes create new opportunities. And they invested heavily in developing
skills—from digitally enabling salespeople to growing internal
analytics talent—that would help the company take each new step in
the transformation journey.
The same pattern occurred at LBG, Codelco, Burberry, Caesars,
and other companies. When your technology leadership capabilities are
weak, everything is a risky struggle. When they are strong, you can do
great things. And when you constantly pay attention to the link between
IT–business relationships, skills, and your digital platform, you can
constantly extend them to create valuable new digital transformation
opportunities.

So far, we’ve shown you what it means to be a Digital Master and
why you should care. We’ve walked you through the process of building
each dimension of digital mastery: digital capabilities in chapters 2
through 4 and leadership capabilities in chapters 5 through 8.

PART I I I
BACK AT THE OFFICE:
A Leader’s Playbook for
digital transformation
You don’t need the vision and leadership qualities of a Steve
Jobs or Jeff Bezos to conduct your own digital transformation.
As a successful executive, you already possess the basic skills to
make your company an insurgent in your own market. As we showed in
parts I and II, it takes some new thinking to set the course and committed
leadership to drive the transformation. In part III, we have distilled
the practices from Digital Masters to present a transformation compass
to help you steer the course of this complex journey (figure III.1):
• Framing the digital challenge: Build awareness of digital
Â�opportunities and threats. Know your starting point, and
assessÂ€your digital maturity. Craft a vision, and ensure that

CHAPTER 9
FRAMING THE DIGITAL
CHALLENGE
As we showed in chapter 1, digital transformation has already hit every
industry we’ve studied. Yet nearly 40 percent of the respondents we
surveyed cite “lack of urgency” as a major obstacle to digital transformation.
1 Why is this? One of the key reasons organizations miss out is
management inertia—failure to sense the need to change. They react to
threats instead of shaping the future.
In industries such as publishing, digital technologies have already
created such an upheaval that the context for transformation is clear;
it’s a burning platform. In other industries, such as manufacturing, the
case for change is less obvious. One manager explained the reason for
the skepticism: “There is too much hype. I can’t push harder because of
all the hype and the overselling from suppliers. I lose my credibility if I
push too hard. So we take a slower approach just to make sure we don’t
give the naysayers their way.”2
Combating inertia requires an awareness of the challenge, knowing
where you’re starting and deciding where you want to go. You know
your industry. As a senior leader, you need to create the appropriate
176 LEADING DIGITAL
momentum around digital transformation. Do this by addressing three
areas early in the process:
• Building awareness: Do top leaders in your organization
Â�understand the potential threats and opportunities from
digital technologies and the need for transformation?
• Defining your starting point: How mature are your digital
Â�competencies, and which current strategic assets will help you to
excel? Have you digitally challenged your current business model?
• Creating a shared vision: Have you aligned your top leadership
team around a vision of the company’s digital future?

The digital transformation compass: framing the digital challenge
Framing the Digital Challenge 177
ARE YOU AWARE OF THE
DIGITAL CHALLENGE?
The first step in framing the challenge is to ensure that your top team
understands the potential business impact of digital technologies.
Only 37 percent of our survey respondents see digital transformation
as a permanent fixture on their current executive agenda. By contrast,
61Â€percent of the same respondents believe that digital transformation
will become critical to their business within the next two years.3
Put Digital Transformation at the Top of Your Agenda Now
Engage senior leaders in the debate about the implications of digital
technologies for your current and future business. Ask, “How can
those technologies potentially disrupt our competitive position?” and
equally, “How can they help improve performance and delight our
customers?”
As the most senior leader in the organization, the CEO is responsible
for ensuring that this framing phase is successful. More often than
not, motivational speeches and internal evangelization are not enough.
You need to ensure that other leaders in your organization visualize the
profound change at hand and understand the business possibilities that
technology can already enable today. For good lessons, look to practical
examples of companies and industries that have been helped or hurt by
digital change.
Understand the Scale and Pace of the Digital Impact
The combination of the scale and pace of the digital impact, along with
your own capabilities, will dictate your risk profile as a firm. Finding
the right tempo for digital transformation in your organization is a
managerial art form. Key aspects of your organization’s culture will
also play a role. Is decision making centralized or decentralized? What
is the propensity of the organization to collaborate and share? You
need to design digital transformation programs that protect profitable
178 LEADING DIGITAL
existing operations and assets, while making the transition to a new
digital business or digitally enhancing part of it.
But be careful. As Andy Grove noted, “Only the paranoid survive.”
4 Disruptive digital innovations often come from outside your
industry. Events can sometimes dictate the pace of the change required.
Competitive and industry analyses have become less useful than before.
As we described in chapter 4, the London taxi market was not disrupted
because incumbent companies failed to go online or develop mobile
apps for hailing taxis. It was disrupted when Hailo saw the opportunity
to bridge the inefficiencies of this two-sided market, winning the drivers
first, then providing a great customer experience. Hailo’s win-win
business model allowed the company to sign more than 60 percent of
London’s twenty-three thousand licensed taxis in less than two years.5
Make the Awareness Process Experiential
Building awareness among the top team is a leadership challenge.
Employees can be unforgiving. One of our respondents complained,
“Management is composed of old people from fifty-five years and
above. They know nothing about technology and its benefits and they
don’t want to learn.”6
Conduct this awareness phase using sound, fact-based research,
but also ensure that you make it a highly experiential exercise for your
team. For example, presenting both a digital hall of fame and a digital
hall of shame creates a balanced view of the risks and opportunities.
We’ve also seen companies conduct a “digital hackathon,” pairing
senior executives with tech-savvy employees to understand and shape
the potential impacts. Other formats and tools can help as well: analysis
of disruptive innovation, war gaming, scenario planning, digital discovery
expeditions, and external peer leaders’ testimonies. All can help you
to generate the right level of awareness in your executive team.
Consider the case of the CEO of a global manufacturing company.
Although he had become convinced that digital technologies and
online channels were going to have a profound effect on his company’s
Framing the Digital Challenge 179
operations and competitive position, the members of his management
board were less enthusiastic. After a period of slow progress, he invited
his board members to California for a weeklong program of intense digital
immersion. He enlisted the advice of former CEOs who had failed
to grasp the digital opportunity, highlighting the personal significance
of what was at stake. He also showcased leading digital technology providers,
industry visionaries, and companies that had transformed their
businesses successfully, underlining the opportunities that digital technologies
made possible. The week was an eye-opener for senior leaders.
It elevated digital transformation to the top of the executive team’s
agenda.
Build a Coalition of Believers
Do you need everyone on board? Probably not. But we’ve seen many
Digital Masters build an early coalition of senior leaders who play key
roles in driving digital transformation inside the organization. Joe
Gross of Allianz Group explained: “With digital meaning different
things to different departments, it became critical to establish a common
ground—a uniform understanding of what digital transformation
meant.”7 Creating awareness helps to unite the core team around a
common purpose and sets digital transformation off on the right foot.
The point is not to turn your senior team into technologists.
The goal is to ensure that, collectively, they understand the potential
threats and opportunities from digital technologies and the need for
transformation.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR
STARTING POINT?
Building a powerful coalition among your top leaders is essential, but
it’s not enough. Large companies survive major transitions not by radically
replacing the old with the new, but by leveraging their existing
resources and competencies in the new digital environment. You need
180 LEADING DIGITAL
to know your starting point. How digitally mature is your organization
today? And what current strategic assets will be relevant in a digital
world?
Assess Your Digital Mastery
To assess your digital mastery you need to take an unbiased view of
your current digital initiatives and skills. Consider in detail both your
digital capabilities and your leadership capabilities. They will point to
one of the four levels of digital mastery we discussed earlier: Beginner,
Conservative, Fashionista, or Digital Master. In chapter 1, we suggested
that you assess your company’s digital mastery by using the short
maturity assessment tool included in the appendix. But, now that you
have seen what Digital Masters do differently, it is time to take this
assessment again. Using the Digital Masters described throughout the
book as a benchmark, spend some time revisiting your company’s position
on the matrix. Consider not just what they do with the technology,
but how they lead the change. Highlight strengths and weaknesses in
your digital capabilities and your leadership capabilities. You now have
an informed view of your company’s transformation starting point.
Chart Your Transformation Journey
Now you can start charting the path and pace of your transformation.
Every company is different. Your company might have the ambition
of a Burberry—to move directly from Beginner to Digital Master.
Doing so will mean simultaneously developing the leadership and digital
capabilities to make your strategy a success. Or you might want
a more Conservative approach—favoring prudence over innovation.
This approach will involve building a foundation of strong leadership
capabilities before experimenting too far with new digital technology.
Or you might be like the Fashionistas—having already launched a
multitude of uncoordinated digital initiatives. Your focus then becomes
developing a coherent vision and a robust governance model and then
Framing the Digital Challenge 181
streamlining or harmonizing digital initiatives across business units. If
you are in a large global organization, digital mastery may also vary
by divisions, lines of business, functions, or geographical locations.
Understanding these differences is important as you craft a trajectory
that will work for your organization.
Assess Your Strategic Assets
Next, we have seen how several Digital Masters conducted an early
assessment of their strategic assets to define those that will be relevant in
a digital world, and those that won’t. As we showed in chapter 5, Pages
Jaunes executives realized early that selling yellow books via its strong
direct-sales force would not be a competitive advantage in the future.
The company’s paper-distribution model had no future. However,
the company’s direct-sales force and its strong relationships with local
businesses were still key strategic assets. Retraining Â�salespeople to sell
digital services was a challenge, but gave the company the foothold it
needed to move into the digital world.
It takes thoughtful analysis to identify which assets will help make
digital transformation successful. You should view strategic assets
through the lens of a digitally transformed world and identify those
that have value. We showed in chapter 4 that rethinking assets, for
instance, in the context of the sharing economy, can yield innovative
business-model thinking. Several definitions exist about what constitutes
strategic assets.8 Beyond financial assets, which can be extremely
useful to defend against new entrants, we have observed that four broad
categories of assets can serve as the foundation for digital transformation:
physical assets, competencies, intangible assets, and data.
Physical Assets. The most obvious assets, physical assets are retail
stores, distribution networks, warehouses and depots, products, and
so on. Some physical assets may be redundant in a digital world, but
combining physical and digital assets in novel ways can often be a keen
source of advantage. For example, 62 percent of banking customers
182 LEADING DIGITAL
in the United States today prefer to bank online.9 Does this mean
that all retail banks will eventually close their branches? It’s unlikely.
About 47Â€percent of US banking customers believe that a bank is not
even legitimate unless it has physical branches.10 But the industry’s
consensus is that a traditional homogeneous, full-service branch network,
catering to customers across all segments, is no longer viable.
Some branches will offer standardized banking needs, while others
will be highly digitized, acting as physical extensions of online and
mobile banking. Digital technologies are changing the role of physical
branches, but they will not render branches extinct in the near future.
Competencies. This type of asset can also be essential to create a
digital advantage. Competencies can reside within your functional
skills (e.g., IT, sales) or core competencies—your unique knowhow
around products, processes, or technologies. For instance, your
Â�frontline employees and salespeople can be crucial assets in maintaining
customer loyalty. They have amassed important knowledge about
customer behaviors and preferences. Similarly, institutional competencies
can be reinforced and augmented though the use of digital technologies.
Nike has world-class product design and engineering talents.
Digital technology helps the two groups work more closely together,
speeding the product development process and enabling a radically
transformed Flyknit manufacturing process.
Intangible Assets. By their very nature, intangible assets are often the
most difficult to gauge. Examples of these assets include brand equity,
company culture, patents, proprietary technologies, and an ecosystem
of partners. Starbucks, for example, was able to leverage its brand as an
asset and extend it online.
Data. This asset class has taken new prominence in the digital world
and warrants significant executive attention. Data has become one of
the most valuable digital assets for companies that have learned how
to master analytics. But often, data is a hidden asset. Many companies
Framing the Digital Challenge 183
still cannot extract value from the data they possess or cannot create
new insights through the combination of their data with other sources.
However, if you can use your data, you will create a new currency with
huge value. Barclays Bank, for example, has started to monetize information
on its thirteen million customers, selling aggregated spending
habits and trends data to other companies.11
Start by looking at your strategic assets in a different light. Can
they offer a competitive advantage in a digital world? Can you reconfigure
or combine them to create something new and valuable? Do you
have, or can you assemble, data-driven insights that no one else has?
Use a broad ideation process to think outside the boundaries of what
your firm and its competitors do today. But don’t start with broadly
defined brainstorming sessions. Start with known unmet customer
needs or sources of complexity in your operations. Ask yourself, How
can we use or combine assets differently to address these? And how can
we use technology to deliver economically?
Digital Masters examine their strategic assets to align their initial
investments with their core skills. Burberry started with its unique customer
experience, Asian Paints with its culture of process excellence,
and Caesars Entertainment with its strengths in analytics and customer
data. It does not matter where you start. What matters is that you start
in an area where you can leverage strategic assets early to establish your
digital advantage.
Challenge Your Business Model
We showed in chapter 4 that business model innovation can be a huge
source of value in digital transformation. But it can also be a threat to
your business. As you gauge the scale and pace of the digital impact on
your business and you reconsider your strategic assets, it is a good time
also to challenge your business model.
Of course, you need first a good grasp of your current business
model. Start thinking about how you could deliver greater value to
customers. Then, figure out how this extra value can be operationally
184 LEADING DIGITAL
delivered at a profit. You can, at this point, exploit the possibilities
offered by digital technology to look at creative and efficient options
to get there. Also learn from how other industries have solved similar
problems or taken advantage of similar opportunities.
Multiple avenues will be possible. You will need to prioritize
options that generate the greatest value to customers, that are operationally
hard to copy, and that can provide you with a profitable economic
model. You will also have to de-risk the change by running
controlled experiments on your new model. Then, gather data to learn
and revise your assumptions.
How is it done? Several practical approaches can help you challenge
your existing business model, explore new ones, or defend against a
potentially disruptive one. We’ve seen companies conduct gaming sessions
such as DYOB (Destroy Your Own Business) or WWAD (What
Would Amazon Do?). Some practical frameworks also exist to help
structure the thinking, such as the business-model canvas developed by
Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur.12 It is good practice to spend
time going through this business model rethinking with your top team,
even if your current business model is not under threat.
IS YOUR TOP TEAM ALIGNED AROUND
A SHARED DIGITAL VISION?
You understand the business challenge posed by digitization. You
know where you’re starting and the range of possibilities before you.
You and your team now need to decide where you want to go.
Craft Your Transformative Vision
Chapter 5 described how Digital Masters craft their visions. You need
to do the same. Your vision needs to be focused on enhancing the customer
experience, streamlining your operations, or combining both to
transform your business model. Don’t fall into the trap of the marketing
slogan with no grounding in the reality of your situation. Authenticity
Framing the Digital Challenge 185
matters. Your vision needs to recognize where you are starting from,
taking stock of your existing competences and culture. It needs to be
built around strategic assets—or a combination of strategic assets—
that will be relevant in a digital future. And it needs to be transformative,
not incremental.
As you craft a digital vision, focus on your business or your customers,
not the technology. Design your vision with a clear intent—a
picture of what needs to change—and clear business outcomes, that is,
the resulting benefits for your customers, employees, and the company’s
performance. Remember, crafting a vision is a journey. So make it specific
enough to give direction to the organization, but give yourself room
to make the vision live and grow over time. Several processes and facilitated
approaches exist to support the design of a good digital vision.13
Align Your Top Team
Having a great digital vision will get you part of the way, but not all the
way—the vision needs to be shared. Many digital initiatives fail to capture
potential value because the vision guiding them is not shared at the
top. As Curt Garner, CIO of Starbucks, noted, “Our entire Â�leadership
team is very engaged and animated around digital and tech and what
it can mean for the company. It is part of the shared goals we have
as a leadership team to continue to lead in terms of innovation and
customer-facing technology.”14 A shared digital vision is a prerequisite
for successful digital transformation and a key component of Digital
Masters’ DNA.
But, of the executives we’ve surveyed, only 57 percent said their
teams were aligned around a vision of a digital future.15 Why is that?
Senior leaders often confuse consensus with an aligned executive team.
Avoid the trap of assuming that information means understanding
and that lack of debate signals alignment. Digital transformation only
works when your top team is actively engaged and owns the digital
vision. You’ll need to be a role model in this respect; test your vision by
making it part of every speech and communication you deliver. Ask for
186 LEADING DIGITAL
feedback, crowdsource ideas, and iterate. Encourage other members of
your top team to do the same, and compare notes.
Aligning executive teams is neither new nor specific to digital
transformation. However, one thing is different with digital. Digital
transformation will respect none of your traditional organizational
boundaries. Digital transformation usually requires the collective talent
and effort of cross-disciplinary teams to innovate and drive change. Joe
Gross of Allianz Group explained: “The reason we involved marketing,
sales and local entities, and not just IT or operations, in our digital
transformation is because we needed everyone’s active participation to
drive change of this scale.”16
Many management techniques can be useful to align your top team.
Facilitated team-building exercises, individual and collective coaching,
and 360-degree feedback are just a few examples. Incentives can also
be useful. We’ve seen several companies give each senior leader a digital
KPI relevant to the transformation goals. Whatever the technique,
good dialogue matters in alignment. Carving out part of your regular
management board meetings for a robust discussion on digital transformation
is a good practice, as is conducting regular facilitated off-site
sessions to steer the progress of your transformation.
How do you know when your team is truly aligned? A good litmus
test is when all members of your senior team sense the urgency of
transformation (awareness of the challenge), understand their strategic
assets and level of digital mastery (starting point), and can articulate
what the digital future looks like (shared vision) through words
and specific goals. When all three conditions are met, it is time for
execution.
So what’s new with digital transformation? Technology adds
another dimension to the traditional business challenges. You need to
make sure your top team can articulate the new threats and opportunities
created by digital technology. Rethinking your traditional assets
through a digital lens creates new possibilities. Some assets will still
be useful; some won’t. New ones, such as data and insights, will be
sources of new value in a digital world. Whereas a functional approach
Framing the Digital Challenge 187
sometimes works in a traditional transformation, digital transformation
respects no organizational boundaries. You need to have aligned
executives who, as a team, have the authority to drive the change across
silos.
HOW WELL HAS YOUR ORGANIZATION
FRAMED THE DIGITAL CHALLENGE?
Table 9.1 (page 188) summarizes how to frame the digital challenge
in three key steps. Look at the central questions at each step, and give
an honest assessment of your company’s progress on a scale from 1 to 7
(1 = strongly disagree; 4 = neutral; 7 = strongly agree). For each of the
three steps, total your scores across the individual questions.
For each step, we have provided you with a target score that places
you among the Digital Masters. We’ve also provided a threshold below
which you should start taking action now to improve your situation. If
your score is in the Digital Master range, you are ready to move on. If
your score is in the middle range, reflect on why. Your team still needs
to work out a few things in the framing phase. If your score is in the
lower range, it is time for remedial actions. If it is well below, we recommend
you conduct a full framing exercise with your top team.

FOCUSING INVESTMENT
Becoming a Fashionista is easy. Everywhere you look, there are
Â�opportunities to invest time, effort, and dollars into making your business
more digital. It is all too easy to invest in them all. The siren song
of digital technologies is a powerful one and can lead many companies
astray. But Digital Masters know their own direction and they stay the
course. They focus on the initiatives that will advance their vision and on
which the Digital Masters can build existing skills and assets. These initiatives
contribute new digital platforms and infrastructure and are the
initiatives that Digital Masters can afford to invest in and see a return.
Digital Masters have a keen focus on the things that are important and
the discipline to disregard those that are not.
Focusing investment is where the rubber meets the road in digital
transformation. You will need to commit real money to fund initiatives,
you will have to engage real people in making things happen, and
you will also need to keep everyone moving in the same direction. Our
research shows that many companies struggle to turn vision into reality.
In non-masters, 78 percent of respondents said that their senior
executives agreed on the importance of digital transformation. But only
40Â€percent said that their leaders were aligned on how to execute it.1
So, what does it take?
190 LEADING DIGITAL
As you focus your early digital transformation investments, be sure
to manage three areas carefully:
• Translating vision into action: Have you converted your digital
vision into strategic goals? Have you translated your digital
transformation priorities into a roadmap of initial activities?
• Building governance: Have you designed governance mechanisms
to steer your transformation in the right direction?
• Funding the transformation: Have you designed a balanced
Â�portfolio of digital investments? Have you worked out the
Â�funding mechanisms for your transformation?

HAVE YOU TRANSLATED YOUR
VISION INTO ACTION?
Translating your vision into a focused set of goals and initiatives is
the key starting point for implementing your digital transformation.
You and your team will have crafted a vision of your digitally transformed
company: what your company will stand for, how it will operate,
andÂ€what you need to do to get there—or partly there. That vision
should start highlighting some of the major landmarks on your digital
transformation journey—how you improve the customer experience,
how you increase your operational performance, and how you adapt
your business model. The astute investments in digital capabilities—
the what of digital transformation—have already been described in part
IÂ€of the book. But how do you turn vision into action?
Digital Masters first translate their vision into strategic goals that
point to what an achieved vision would look like. Second, they build a
roadmap of initiatives—a roadmap that starts guiding the organization
toward the vision.
Define What Good Looks Like
Translate your digital vision into top-down strategic goals that point
to what an achieved vision would look like. Articulate top-level goals
only. Specific KPIs will come later, once you have a detailed program.
For example, “By 2016, two-thirds of our customer contacts will come
from digital channels.” Or “Digital sales will represent 60 percent of
our total revenue in four years.” Or “In two years, we will have straightthrough
processing of our claims, without manual interventions.”
Make sure your goals reflect what you are trying to achieve in a balanced
way. Your goals should not just be about financials, but should
also be expressed in terms of customer experience and operations as
well as the organizational capabilities you need to build. This strategic
scorecard will provide a basic template for your entire digital transformation
efforts.
192 LEADING DIGITAL
There are several tools and methods available to help you construct
and manage this scorecard, such as the balanced scorecard methodology.
2 Many business management software tools can also help you
automate the process. But the key is to create enough time with your
top team to design and manage a scorecard that truly reflects what
“good” will look like once your vision becomes reality. Of course, you
will need to iterate and sometimes correct your course. But just like a
traditional compass, the scorecard will provide a point of reference with
which to navigate your digital transformation.
Build a Roadmap for Your Digital Journey
In a perfect world, your digital transformation would deliver an
unmatched customer experience, enjoy the industry’s most efficient
operations, and spawn innovative, new business models. There are
myriad opportunities for digital technology to improve your business,
and no company can entertain them all at once. The reality of limited
resources, limited attention spans, and limited capacity for change will
force focused choices. This is the aim of your roadmap.
Find Your Entry Point
Many companies have come to realize that before they can create a
wholesale change within their organization, they have to find an entry
point that will begin shifting the needle. How? They start by building
a roadmap that leverages existing assets and capabilities, as we
discussed in chapter 9. Burberry, for example, enjoyed a globally recognized
brand and a fleet of flagship retail locations around the world.
The company started by revitalizing its brand and customer experience
in stores and online. Others, like Codelco, began with the core operational
processes of their business. Caesars Entertainment combined
strong capabilities in analytics with a culture of customer service to
deliver a highly personalized guest experience. There is no single right
way to start your digital transformation. What matters is that you find
Focusing Investment 193
the existing capability—your sweet spot—that will get your company
off the starting blocks.
Once your initial focus is clear, you can start designing your transformation
roadmap. Which investments and activities are necessary to
close the gap to your vision? What is predictable, and what isn’t? What
is the timing and scheduling of each initiative? What are the dependencies
between them? What organizational resources, such as analytics
skills, are required?
Engage Practitioners Early in the Design
Designing your roadmap will require input from a broad set of stakeholders.
Rather than limit the discussions to the top team, engage the
operational specialists who bring an on-the-ground perspective. This
will minimize the traditional vision-to-execution gap.3 You can crowdsource
the design, as we showed in chapter 6 with Pernod Ricard. Or
you can use facilitated workshops, such as “digital days,” as an effective
way to capture and distill the priorities and information you will need
to consider. We’ve seen several Digital Masters do both.
Make no mistake; designing your roadmap will take time, effort,
and multiple iterations. But you will find it a valuable exercise. It forces
agreement on priorities and helps align senior management and the
people tasked to execute the program. Your roadmap will become more
than just a document. If executed well, it can be the canvas of the transformation
itself. Because your roadmap is a living document, it will
evolve as your implementation progresses.
Design for Business Outcome, Not Technology
Technology for its own sake is a common trap. Don’t build your roadmap
as a series of technology projects. Technology is only part of the
story in digital transformation and often the least challenging one.
For example, we described in chapter 6 how the major hurdles for
Enterprise 2.0 platforms are not technical. Deploying the platforms
is relatively straightforward, and today’s solutions are mature. The
194 LEADING DIGITAL
challenge lies in changing user behavior—encouraging adoption and
sustaining engagement in the activities the platform is meant to enable.
Express your transformation roadmap in terms of business outcomes.
For example, “Establish a 360-degree understanding of ourÂ€customers.”
Build into your roadmap the many facets of organizational
change that your transformation will require: customer experience,
operational processes, employee ways of working, organization, culture,
communication—the list goes on. This is why contributions from
a wide variety of stakeholders are so critical.
Think a Series of Sprints, not Marathons
The digital world moves quickly. The rapid pace of technology innovation
today does not lend itself to multiyear planning and waterfall
development methods common in the ERP era. Markets change, new
technologies become mainstream, and disruptive entrants begin courting
your customers. Your roadmap will need to be nimble enough to
recognize these changes, adapt for them, and course-correct.
To design an agile transformation, borrow an approach that has
become common among today’s leading software companies.4 Keep
people committed to the end goal, but pace your initiatives as short
sprints of effort. Create prototype solutions, and experiment with new
technologies or approaches. Evaluate the results, and incorporate the
results into your evolving roadmap. Adam Brotman, Starbucks CDO,
explained the iterative process: “We didn’t have all the answers, but we
started thinking about other things we could do . . . I think it worked to
not go too far, too fast, but to keep a vision in mind and keep building
on successes along the way.”5
This test-and-learn approach will require some new ways of working
in its own right, but it enjoys some distinct advantages. By markettesting
ideas quickly before they go to scale, this approach saves time
and money. Its short cycle times also make it more adaptive to external
changes. Finally, it enables your transformation to sustain momentum
through small, incremental successes, rather the big-bang approach
of long-term programs. However, as we described in chapter 8, some
Focusing Investment 195
efforts, such as your technology platform, are large enough that they
need a more traditional approach to understanding requirements and
delivering capabilities.
Put Dollar Signs on Your Journey
You need initiative-based business cases that establish a clear link from
the operational changes in your roadmap to tangible business benefits.
You will need to involve employees on the front lines to help validate
how operational changes will contribute to strategic goals.
The basic building blocks of a business case for digital initiatives
are the same as for any business case. Your team needs to work out the
costs, the benefits, and the timing of the return. But digital transformation
is still uncharted territory. The cost side of the equation is easier,
but benefits can be difficult to quantify, even when, intuitively, they
seem crystal clear.
Building a business case for digital initiatives is both an art and
a science. With so many unknowns, you’ll need to take a pragmatic
approach to investments in light of what you know and what you don’t
know.
Start with what you know, where you have most of the information
you need to support a robust cost-benefit analysis. A few lessons
learned from our Digital Masters can be useful.
Don’t build your business case solely as a series of technology
investments. You will miss a big part of the costs. Cost the adoption
efforts—digital skill building, organizational change, communication,
and training—as well as the deployment of the technology. You won’t
realize the full benefits—or possibly any benefits—without them.
Frame the benefits in terms of the business outcomes you want to
reach. These outcomes can be the achievement of goals or the fixing of
problems—that is, outcomes that drive more customer value, higher
revenue, or a better cost position. Then define the tangible business
impact and work backward into the levers and metrics that will indicate
what “good” looks like. For instance, if one of your investments is supposed
to increase digital customer engagement, your outcome might be
196 LEADING DIGITAL
increasing engagement-to-sales conversion. Then work back into the
main metrics that drive this outcome, for example, visits, likes, inquiries,
ratings, reorders, and the like.
When the business impact of an initiative is not totally clear, look
at companies that have already made similar investments. Your technology
vendors can also be a rich, if somewhat biased, source of business
cases for some digital investments.
But, whatever you do, some digital investment cases will be trickier
to justify, be they investments in emerging technologies or cutting-
edge practices. For example, what is the value of gamifying your
brands’ social communities? For these types of investment opportunities,
experiment with a test-and-learn approach, as we discussed
in Â�chapterÂ€ 8. State your measures of success, run small pilots, evaluate
results, and refine your approach. Several useful tools and methods
exist, such as hypotheses-driven experiments with control groups,
or A/B testing.6 The successes (and failures) of small experiments can
then become the benefits rationale to invest at greater scale. Whatever
the method, use an analytical approach; the quality of your estimated
return depends on it.
Translating your vision into strategic goals and building an actionable
roadmap is the first step in focusing your investment. It will galvanize
the organization into action. But if you needed to be an architect
to develop your vision, you need to become a plumber to develop your
roadmap. Be prepared to get your hands dirty.
HAVE YOU CHOSEN THE RIGHT
GOVERNANCE MODEL?
Defining your strategic goals and your implementation roadmap will
help you get everyone focused on the digital priorities—the priorities
you have selected for the positive impact they will have on your customer
experience or operations. Roadmaps help with the what of digital
transformation but not with the how—the way you conduct your transformation
(discussed in part II). Earlier, we discussed in detail the need
Focusing Investment 197
to craft a vision and how to do it. Later in the book, we will address
how you can mobilize your organization effectively and the need to get
IT and the business working in sync. But in this current stage, you need
to figure out how you will ensure that everyone keeps moving in the
right direction. This is where governance is useful.
Build the Right Governance
One of the major challenges of digital transformation is that there
is no single obvious owner of the transformation. Marketing? IT?
Operations? Your biggest business unit? In a complex company with
many different functions, business units, and geographic areas, who
owns the transformation can be a very difficult question to answer. But
not answering it is a recipe for failure.
Digital transformation engages a broad, cross-functional set of
stakeholders. Once those people are motivated (or once they see a big
pot of money available for spending), they’ll start moving in the direction
they think is best. That direction may not be what’s best for the
company as a whole.
You need to steer the efforts of all of those people in a common
direction. And that takes governance. In our research, we have seen
that governance is an important driver of the profitability advantage
enjoyed by Digital Masters. But our research also showed something
else. No single governance model is right for every company. This is no
surprise, because research over many years has failed to find the single
best governance model for IT across all companies. Digital governance
is, if anything, even more complex than IT governance.
As we discussed in chapter 7, digital governance focuses on two
clear goals—coordination and sharing—whatever your company is.
And there are some common mechanisms to help you make it work.
In creating your digital governance model, you’ll need to decide what
you want to coordinate and share. Then you’ll need to figure out how
to make it happen in your company. Finally, you’ll need ways to know
when to adjust your governance over time.
198 LEADING DIGITAL
Decide What You Need to Coordinate and Share
Start by identifying the behaviors you want to encourage or discourage.
What do you want to coordinate across the company? What do you
want to share? Consider all of the investments, resources, and activities
in your roadmap.
First, ask yourself, “What resources should we be sharing or coordinating
across groups?” Sharing resources like digital technology platforms,
talent, data, or other digital assets can offer economies of scale.
However, sharing requires extra effort to ensure that the resources
meet the needs of the groups that are sharing them. You might choose
instead to allow some resources to exist in each business unit, but coordinate
their activities. And some may work perfectly well without coordination,
at least in the short term.
A second question to ask is, “What initiatives should be shared or
coordinated across the company?” Should you take on a single social
media strategy for all your company’s products or allow each brand to
design its own? If each brand designs its own, should the brands coordinate
their technologies or vendors? Should they work with common
standards? Should they develop interfaces so they can work together?
Research shows that centralized control of a standardized platform
can provide both efficiency and agility simultaneously.7 Conversely, too
much autonomy can lead to spaghetti, which reduces efficiency, creates
risk, and decreases agility.8
Standardized systems and processes can provide economies of scale
to all units, while allowing each unit to build extensions on top. For
example, the Caesars online platform is standardized, allowing the
company to manage it efficiently and to easily make changes that affect
all units. But employees in each hotel can customize their websites’
style, information, and marketing campaigns and can even build extensions
on top of the platform to meet local needs.9
Also be sure that your choices of sharing and coordination do not stifle
innovation. You want to build economies of scale and drive out unnecessary
complexity, but you also want to allow business units some leeway
Focusing Investment 199
to find new ways of working. Your processes can make exceptions to allow
experiments to happen, or possibly even seed innovative activities.
Finally, consider whether sharing and coordination should be mandatory
or optional and at what level of the firm. P&G prides itself on the
entrepreneurial autonomy of its business units, but mandates strict coordination
and sharing of processes such as finance and HR. Meanwhile,
business unit leaders can opt in to other services such as innovation and
brand management if they feel doing so would benefit them.10
Choose Mechanisms to Meet Those Goals
Some of the coordination and sharing you desire will occur naturally as
part of the way your company works. But much of it won’t. The design
of your organization may lead to unwanted behaviors. Some units will
optimize for their own needs instead of the company’s needs. Others
will follow the standard way of working without thinking about how
to innovate it. Still others will shut down innovation in a too-intense
desire to standardize.
If governance is not someone’s job, it won’t happen. For example,
Adam Brotman of Starbucks, explained: “Before the CDO position
was created, my job was web, mobile and social media . . . [I]t wasn’t
global digital marketing, it wasn’t card [Starbucks Cards and mobile
payments], and it wasn’t loyalty. Those were in three different groups
separately in the organization. We realized those were all one thing,
they all work best together and if you listed the vision for where we
wanted to go with digital, it was encompassing all those things.”11
Chapter 7 highlighted in detail several mechanisms you can use to
make governance happen. To design your digital governance model,
select the mix of mechanisms that will encourage the right behaviors in
your organization.
Governance Committees
These bodies are the simplest to implement. However, because they are
no one’s “day job,” committees are limited in what they can accomplish.
200 LEADING DIGITAL
Committees can be a useful starting point, but usually need to evolve to
another mechanism.
Digital Leadership Roles
No major change effort happens without someone in charge. Many
companies make digital transformation someone’s day job by naming
a chief digital officer (CDO) or an equivalent role. Unless you just
want light coordination, you need to give teeth to the digital leader role
by appointing a senior executive. Who that executive reports to, and
what authority he or she has, matters a great deal. The executive’s network
of informal contacts can also be very helpful. Also consider how
you can use formal liaison roles to help drive the change across your
organization.
Shared Digital Units
These groups are effectively shared service units for the digital age.
Rather than trying to bridge the gaps in the digital activities of IT,
marketing, and other groups, shared digital units allow you to integrate
their activities into a single group. These units are typically stand-alone
and manage their own budget and resources. Shared units can act as
a powerful accelerator for your transformation. But they are the most
resource-intensive of all the mechanisms.
Plan to Evolve Your Governance Model
If no single governance model is right for every organization, another
point holds true too. No governance model is right forever. As your
digital capabilities improve, and as your governance models take hold,
you’ll find that you need to make some adjustments.
Pay attention to the coordination and sharing behaviors that you
want to encourage. How well is your governance model making them
happen? As business units learn that shared digital resources work well,
you may be able to relax some of your more heavy-handed enforcement
mechanisms. You might devolve centralized skills and initiatives to key
Focusing Investment 201
business units. On the other hand, you might want to go the other way,
expanding the role of your digital unit to drive even more sharing and
coordination or launch new digital products.
Also pay attention to the negative consequences of your governance
model. Are small business units getting enough attention? Are your
governance processes too bureaucratic? Are your standards squeezing
out innovative ideas that might be useful? Is a decentralized approach
preventing you from sharing some practices developed by different
business units?
Finally, think about your digital leaders. Do you need to augment
your steering committee with a full-time CDO to drive changes in culture
and governance process? If the organization is starting to adopt
the right behaviors naturally, should you evolve the role of the CDO
from strong governance toward something different—maybe driving
innovation? Do you still need a strong enterprise-level CDO, or can
unit-level CDOs work with a committee or shared unit to drive the
coordination and synergy you need?
No governance model is perfect; they all need tuning. And over
time, they will all need to evolve as you work to drive new behaviors
and use your resources most effectively.
DO YOU HAVE THE FUNDING MODELS
FOR YOUR TRANSFORMATION?
Digital transformation might be a strategic opportunity for your
company or, sometimes, it may be a response to a burning platform.
Regardless, the transformation will always need serious investment.
You and your team have defined your strategic goals and the financial
justification for your roadmap. Now, you need to build a balanced view
between long-term capability building and short-term return. You also
need clarity on the sources of funding. Finally, you need to ensure that
the metrics used for your transformation make sense up and down the
organization.
202 LEADING DIGITAL
Manage Your Digital Investment Portfolio
You need to build an investment portfolio that balances the goals of
your vision with the desired combination of short- and long-term pay
off. A wide body of research covers IT portfolio management principles
and classifies technology investments.12 In our research, we have
consistently observed four broad types of digital investments.
Foundational Investments
Foundational investments are the table stakes for the strategic success
of your transformation. Without them, you may find it can become
difficult to make any scalable progress at all. They are the core systems,
platforms, or tools that you need to enable advances in digital customer
experience or operations. Often, these investments are too costly, or
their benefits too distributed, to be absorbed by one unit’s P&L (profit
and loss) alone.
A large global company, for example, invested in a global contentmanagement
platform to unify the flow of content between its diverse
business units. None of the business units could justify the benefits on
their own; the benefits were at the corporate level, including an aggregate
of smaller returns in each business. The company’s CEO understood
that this investment was on the critical path of his company’s
transformation. Rather than build the business case for each unit separately,
he made an executive decision to invest in the new platform.
Foundational investments do not lend themselves to detailed benefits
cases. They require a leadership call. Hence, they are often funded
centrally.
Maintenance Investments
Although maintenance investments do not help advance your digital
capabilities, they are nevertheless essential to keeping the business running
or minimizing risk. They may also be driven by external factors,
such as regulatory and compliance requirements. Upgrading website
Focusing Investment 203
functionalities, providing compliance analytics to regulators, or Â�funding
security applications would fall in this category.
ROI-Driven Investments
ROI-driven investments are tightly linked to your transformation
roadmap. They are usually project-based with a clear line of sight to
KPI improvements and ROI targets. These investments are generally
managed within the normal financial planning cycle of your organization
but may come from a separate digital fund or account.
Early-Stage Innovation Investments
By definition, early-stage investments are more speculative and their
returns are highly variable. For example, these investments can fund
incubators, digital labs, research partnerships, or specific experiments.
Manage these as if you were a venture capitalist: select the most promising
projects, kill losers early, and maximize the commercial value of
winners.
Manage a portfolio that balances long-term capability building
with short-term ROI. To start, map out the percentages that you currently
allocate to each category. Then discuss with your team what
the optimum balance needs to be to accelerate your digital transition.
Often, investments in digital transformation are an easier sell when
they are budget-neutral or generate at least as much value as they consume.
Consider using cost savings from industrializing IT to fund
other digital initiatives in the portfolio, such as those focused on building
new capabilities or developing innovative new products. In other
words, squeeze the old to fund the new.
Exploit Various Funding Mechanisms
Assuming your company is like most, you will have more demand for
financing your digital transformation than funds available. The trick
here is to diversify your sources of funding. There are many funding
204 LEADING DIGITAL
mechanisms available, but most fall into one of three basic models:
central, local, and partner-supported.
Central Investments
Your company may need to make central investments when the services
provided are owned by a central function or when you need to coordinate
between entities, to leverage the investment. This will often be the
case for your foundational digital investments. Central investments can
also be used to fund your innovation—such as seed funds or incubators.
Local Investments
When projects within your roadmap are directly benefiting specific
parts of the business, local investments work best. An example may be
an e-commerce application for one of your brands. You need to ensure
that, when possible, you leverage locally funded implementations across
the wider business. If the potential for enterprise-wide leverage is substantial,
you can offer a central subsidy for a local effort. Or, you can
pay a royalty fee back to the unit in an app-store type of model when
the application is used by others.
Partner-Supported Investments
Partner-supported investments come in several flavors. You can get a
partner to support an initial investment in exchange for a minimum
service volume and duration commitment. You can ask your partner
for performance-based investments. You can sell or lease assets (physical
or IP) to a partner to fund new investments. Or, if your partner is
launching new technologies, you can act as a showcase pilot for their
marketing in exchange for a substantially reduced investment.13
Don’t Let Transformation Goals Get Lost in Translation
Executives speak the language of strategy, cost, and revenue.
Employees on the front lines speak the language of product, work flow,
and click-throughs. A survey by CFO Research Services found that
Focusing Investment 205
only 36 percent of finance executives agree that the metrics they use
to assess technology investment are commonly understood across the
company.14 Clearly, something is lost in translation between strategic
measures of success and operational KPIs.
That translation also needs to work both ways. Senior leaders need
to understand how operational improvements drive real business performance.
As one high-tech executive said, “When the marketing guys
came up with their click-through rate, cost-per-thousand impressions,
and sentiment-analysis metrics to justify their investment, I could tell
that the whole board had no clue what they were talking about. The
outcome became obvious.”
Strategic goals need to be understood in terms that make sense to
on-the-ground employees. Likewise, operational and customer experience
improvements must be translated into financial benefits that
can be tracked and understood at senior levels. But as a senior leader,
your role is to ensure that both groups speak a common language when
developing the investment and funding case for your transformation.15
DO YOU HAVE A SHARP FOCUS?
Success in digital transformation is as much about what you don’t do as
what you do. In the context of so many opportunities to digitize your
business, it’s easy to become distracted by the latest shiny object. But
when it comes to making real strategic commitments, investing real
dollars, and involving real people, only a focused approach to digital
transformation delivers real business value.
Play to your strengths. Leverage existing assets and capabilities
to build your roadmap. Build governance mechanisms to steer the
Â�transformation and maximize its return. Be clear about your funding
models. These steps are critical to turn your vision into action. The
next step is to mobilize your organization to make it happen. In chapter
11, we’ll show you how to do it.
So what’s new about focusing investment in the digital world?
You need to design an agile transformation roadmap to cope with the
206 LEADING DIGITAL
velocity of digital change. You may need to appoint a person to serve
as chief digital officer. Since different units, such as marketing, may be
more willing to fund digital efforts on their own, coordination is even
more important than for other technology investments.
HOW WELL HAS YOUR ORGANIZATION
FOCUSED ITS INVESTMENT?
Table 10.1 summarizes how you can focus investment in three key
steps. Look at the central questions at each step, and give an honest

MOBILIZING THE
ORGANIZATION
Large, transformative change programs only succeed when leaders are
able to earn employees’ trust, engage them, and mobilize them into
action. Digital transformation is no different. However, surprisingly,
our survey shows that 64 percent of employees still do not feel that
senior leaders have adequately shared a vision for digital transformation
with everyone in the organization.1 So, what can we learn from Digital
Masters? To mobilize your organization and achieve high impact, ask
yourself three fundamental questions:
• Signaling: Are you marketing the ambitions and the benefits of
digital transformation sufficiently clearly to the organization?
• Earning the right to engage: Are you building sufficient momentum
with employees by co-creating solutions and involving
those who will have to make the change happen?
• Setting new behaviors: Are you actively encouraging a culture
shift by using digital technologies to change the way people
work and collaborate?
Crafting programs to answer these three questions will Â�substantially
increase the chances of success of your digital transformation efforts.
210 LEADING DIGITAL
Of course, the effort is not just up to you. The entire leadership team
should be on board for this journey.
ARE YOU SIGNALING YOUR
AMBITIONS EFFECTIVELY?
In chapter 9, we discussed the need to both mobilize your top team on
the impact of digital transformation and align around a future vision.
But there is a tougher crowd to get on board—your entire organization.
You need to become the marketing manager for your Â�transformation
ambitions. How? Send clear signals to the organization early. Make

The digital transformation compass: mobilizing the organization

sure the value proposition you craft is clear and has meaning for
Â�individuals and functions. And then, market the ambitions at scale
using all channels available.
Send Signals
Put your transformation process in motion early by sending unequivocal
internal and external signals about the importance of the digital
phenomenon and the resulting changes that are expected. The signals
can take several forms. Some are metrics- or performance-driven, such
as the CEO’s declaration that Pages Jaunes would shift from having
roughly 30 percent of its business online to more than 75 to 80
percent within four years.2 Some signals can also be organizational.
We’ve seen the COO of a large division within a global company be
appointed for the CDO role within the same unit, sending a strong
signal throughout the firm. Other signals relate to visible branding of
the Â�transformation to all the firm’s stakeholders—as L’Oréal did when
the CEO announced 2010 as the “digital year.”3 You can send signals
in many ways; what matters is that you do it visibly to start mobilizing
your organization.
Explain Benefits Clearly
But sending signals to employees is not enough. To market your ambitions
effectively, you also need to explain the benefits and make digital
transformation meaningful to key individual constituents. Put yourself
in their shoes, and ask yourself, “What’s in it for me?” Traditional
financial and competitive logics are important but not sufficient to
engage employees’ hearts and minds. You need to articulate how digital
transformation will improve the way people do their jobs—Â�making
their work easier, better, faster, or more fulfilling. You also need to
adapt those messages for your different organizational communities.
For example, explain to your finance department how digital tools will
increase the visibility and accuracy of financial reporting; show your
212 LEADING DIGITAL
marketers how to get a more refined, data-rich view of their customer
segmentation. Position the benefits of digital transformation in terms
that make sense to the individuals who will be critical in making your
vision a reality.
Facing a sharp decline in market share because of new competition,
a global mobile operator redefined its vision: to become the first truly
digital brand in the mobile market. To mobilize the organization, the
company produced and distributed a video program on all its internal
platforms. Board members and the top 150 executives then engaged
in an open dialogue with employees and individual functions—using
an internal social network—to explain the scale of change, the resulting
customer benefits, and how work practices would improve and to
solicit employee feedback and ideas.
Giving your digital transformation a meaning for each constituent
and function will substantially increase people’s engagement. As employees
understand which part of the digital vision they can actively contribute
to and how it can benefit their work, they will become advocates.
Use All Available Communication Channels
To mobilize at scale and ensure that the change is understood by all
employees, use all available digital platforms within your organization—
video, enterprise social networks, webcasts, intranets. Use your
traditional channels as well. And encourage open feedback and dialogue.
Reaching out to all employees in this way will create the scale,
but remember, these tools are only carriers of the message. You also
need to work on the message itself. What counts is authenticity. Show
that you care about people’s contribution to making the vision a reality
and that you value the increased dialogue. Your internal communication
and HR departments can be great allies to ensure the success of the
mobilization. Enroll them in putting a two-way communication plan
together. Then craft the right messages, and design a process to analyze
the feedback.
Mobilizing the Organization 213
HAVE YOU EARNED THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE?
Creating organizational momentum at scale is not a given Â�management
right; you need to earn it! How can it be done effectively? Do four
things consistently. First, encourage the leadership of the company to
become role models—actively promoting the behaviors that represent
the new vision. Second, co-design a detailed implementation plan of
the transformation with the people responsible for its success. Third,
identify and engage early the true believers, those transformation
champions who are willing to take risks in making the change a reality.
Finally, find early quick wins of how digital can visibly improve the
business, both internally and externally.
Walk the Talk
Mahatma Gandhi famously stated, “Be the change you wish to see in
the world.” This holds true for leading digital transformation. As a
leader, you can influence the transition to digital by becoming a role
model for the most important managerial decisions. An executive at
Pfizer put it this way: “The way we are approaching it is to say ‘Think
digital first,’ so everything we create, every piece of content, every piece
of information we have, should be accessible digitally.”4 By acting as a
role model for the desired change and encouraging your colleagues to
do so, you take the first important step in earning the right to engage
your employees. As described in chapter 6, Coca-Cola faced huge challenges
when it deployed its internal social collaboration platform. Only
when Coke’s executives became engaged on the platform did the community
become active. “With executive engagement, you don’t have to
mandate activity.”5
For some tech-savvy business leaders, the act of being a role model
will be obvious; for others, it might feel unnatural. But it is worth persevering.
The benefits of executive engagement far outweigh the effort
over the long run.

Co-create Your Transformation
Digital technologies allow you to co-create your transformation with
people up and down the organization more easily than ever before.
Pernod Ricard opened up the dialogue with its employees to Â�co-create
its entire digital roadmap. Not only is crowdsourcing a good way to
generate new ideas and increase the quality of your transformation
design, but it is also engaging.
In June 2013, Société Générale, the French-based global bank,
mobilized sixteen thousand employees in nineteen countries to shape
its detailed transformation plan.6 The bank focused the exercise on the
three core streams of its transformation roadmap, namely, improving
customer experience, changing the way employees collaborate,
and investing in the right IT systems to support the change. Using its
internal social network, the bank gathered more than a thousand initiatives,
which were reviewed and analyzed concurrently by thousands of
employees. The most promising were presented to the CEO and the
top team for final validation and integrated into the bank’s transformation
plan. Little buy-in was needed by the business after that. As
Frederic Oudéa, Société Générale’s CEO, explained, “There will be
no overnight revolution in our digital transition; we must encourage
business-led initiatives from the front line.”7
Identify Your Digital Champions
Identifying your true believers within the organization will help scale
your mobilization efforts and multiply their impact. Digital Masters
leverage their digital champions through both formal and informal
roles. These individuals have bought into the vision, the strategy, and
the resulting need for transformation. They are essential to connect
the top-down digital initiatives with the various dimensions of the
Â�organization—regional, functional, business lines, brands, and the like.
They ensure that the part of the organization they champion remains
engaged and that its specific needs and contributions are represented at
Mobilizing the Organization 215
the corporate level. No matter what their age or tenure in the company,
digital champions are both technology savvy and business savvy. They
network well and create horizontal influence to help you implement the
transformation across silos. Look after your champions well. They will,
most likely, be your organization’s future digital leaders.
But why should middle management not lead the digital
change? This is a tricky issue in many firms. As conversations move
online and information is transparent and more freely available,
Â�middle-management roles in traditional hierarchical structures may
need to evolve. Some middle managers may become great digital champions,
but many others won’t. This is particularly important in firms
where the digital divide—the gap between digital-savvy managers and
those who aren’t—is important. You will have to tackle this leadership
challenge early. Digital champions are essential to the success of your
digital transformation.
Identify Quick Wins
Finally, earning the right to engage the organization is about getting
results fast. You will need to stop telling, and start showing, early.
Quick wins are a good way to motivate believers and to silence naysayers.
But you need a formal process to identify the wins, to elevate their
visibility, and to celebrate them.
This is where pilots and experiments can help. Luckily, Â�digital
technology allows for very effective and low-cost targeted experiments.
Unlike celluloid films, digital photography allows you to take Â�multiple
shots and experiment with different angles and lighting Â�conditions
with next to zero risks. Similarly, digital technology allows you to
Â�experiment with the business and iterate more effectively. Find a pocket
of efficiency gains in operations, make a better decision through an
Â�analytics pilot, or generate better sales results in a regional retail experiment.
Quick wins like these will speak volumes and help Â�mobilize your
organization. And if you can scale those quick wins, it will also generate
huge benefits to the organization.
216 LEADING DIGITAL
ARE YOU SETTING NEW BEHAVIORS
FOR THE ORGANIZATION?
Digital technologies are transforming our traditional ways of working.
New ways of collaborating, communicating, and otherwise interacting
are changing the moral contract between companies and employees.
Michelle Pattison, global agile workplace director at Unilever,
explained:
How employees receive communication and interact with their
colleagues and employers, in a company like Unilever, has been
changing fast, enabled by the technology we have at our finger
tips today. In our traditional ways of working, as with so many
businesses, time and attendance were the key measurement of
employees. There was no argument about where you worked and
when you worked. At Unilever, we have introduced our “Agile
Working” program, which values the performance and output
of our people. For us, time and attendance are artificial barriers
that can be removed allowing employees to have a far greater say
in how they work. It builds our capability around the world, it
safeguards business continuity and keeps a far more diverse pool of
talent in our business. It is a win-win all round.8
The exact shape of the future digital organization is not yet
clear. What is evident is that new ways of working, powered by digital
technologies, are evolving the cultures and work practices within
Â�organizations. And over time, they will also change how organizations
are structured and function. What are the drivers?
Digital technology is fostering a more transparent sharing of
information up and down, but also across the organization. Forums,
communities, and new data flows are improving collaboration and
decision making. Online meetings, webcasts, and video communications
are allowing employees from all functions, and regardless of
location, to come together to solve problems or innovate. Traditional
Mobilizing the Organization 217
internal processes have gone self-service, giving flexibility to employees
to arrange their work at will—whether people are booking a flight, filing
expenses, or updating the weekly sales forecast.
We’ve seen many Digital Masters actively evolving their culture
toward building such high-performing digital businesses. It does not
happen randomly; it needs leadership. Your organization will have to
adapt to these new ways of working and the resulting cultural evolution.
How do you start? First, it’s about driving new behaviors—what you
reward and what you don’t. Second, it’s about encouraging adoption to
ensure your technology investments benefit the business as intended.
Third, it’s about tolerating failure and learning from it. And finally, it’s
about making new ways of working become the routine.
Make Visible Changes to Work Practices
Adapting work practices and evolving culture involve a multitude of
small changes in behavior from the top. Top-down communication,
no matter how inspiring, is not enough. There is no silver bullet, but
action and role modeling speaks louder than words.
Question your intuition—ensure that your most important managerial
decisions are based on the power of data and analytics. Fight
against organization fragmentation and silo-based thinking. Encourage
the transparency, core process standardization, and operations efficiency
that digital technologies provide.
Conversely, lead from behind, and adopt an encouraging style, to
allow self-organizing teams to solve problems, innovate, and further
your vision. This is management innovation powered by digital technologies
and committed leadership. Do this successfully, and you will
start to weave a new cultural signature within your organization.
Most CEOs talk about the need to be customer oriented. But
Richard Branson, CEO of Virgin Group, was proactive about it. He
invited his 2.3 million Twitter followers to pose questions about his
company using the hashtag #AskRichard. By inviting the outside world
into a dialogue, he sent strong signals externally but also internally.9
218 LEADING DIGITAL
To advance your culture, sometimes you need to accept a level
of risk. Peter Aceto, CEO of ING Direct in Canada, did just that.
Using the company’s internal social network, he encourages employees
to vent their frustrations about the company directly with him.
He explained: “We may not have solved major business issues by having
this bitch session, but with my support, employees know that it
is safe to be heard, and that dialogue is encouraged and feedback is
actionable. And my senior team is reminded of the power that resides
in having real conversations, honesty and open debate. Whether it is
the Pandora’s Box or a big can of worms you’re opening, the point is
the cans exist, the conversations take place and there’s always room
for improvement.”10
Encourage Adoption, Not Deployment
A great way to fail in your digital transformation is to focus on the
deployment of technology rather than its adoption by business users.
Sound obvious? Yet how many millions of dollars have been spent
on analytics technology with no visible improvements—or even any
changes—to the way decisions are made within a business? How many
companies have deployed internal social networks with great fanfare
only to see a slow take-up or a huge slowdown after a few months?
The way some companies typically introduce these platforms to
their organizations is partly to blame. Implementations that measure
success in terms of live sites or licenses focus only on deployment, not
Â�adoption. They miss the true value of their digital investments: collaboration
among actively engaged users, smarter decision making,
increased sharing of best practices, and, over time, sustained behavior
change. The result is often widely deployed internal applications that
no one actually uses effectively. Why does that happen?
There are three main reasons. First, these kinds of digital programs
are all too often treated as technology implementations. Poor
technical leaders may measure success on deployment metrics, while
considering true business adoption as someone else’s job. Second,
Mobilizing the Organization 219
platform vendors often oversell the promise of instant change through
digital Â�technology. They make their money selling products and software,
rarely by getting them used at scale. And finally, user adoption
programs cost money.
Your true ROI will come from embedding new work practices into
the processes, the work flows, and, ultimately, the culture of organizations.
Even when the value of adoption is understood, cost containment
often takes over. Faced with limited budgets, companies focus on
the most tangible part first—deploying the technology. The difficult
training and organizational change required for full adoption is left for
later, and often, “later” never comes.
This partial implementation drives negativism and can potentially
threaten a big part of your digital transformation program. Business
users do not see the value and fail to engage in the new digital platforms.
The platforms are themselves blamed for the failure. Cynicism
sets in. Every additional digital investment is negatively scrutinized,
and the whole digital transformation program slows down.
Encouraging employees to adopt digital tools and technologies,
and doing so visibly, through role modeling, gamification, rewards, or
any other methods, can have a significant impact on behaviors. When
adoption programs are well implemented, the benefits become obvious.
Bayer’s material science CIO, Kurt De Ruwe, explained how the
introduction of a social platform created an irreversible movement:
“You can’t stop it. Once you make it available to people on the right
platform the magic happens . . . Why do I participate? If you don’t do
it then your internal employees will find a way of leading themselves.
Micro-blogging is basically engaging with just anybody in the organization
that wants to engage with them. That is totally creating a different
culture environment in the organization. Sometimes, if people ask
me to quantify in euros or dollars what the platform has delivered to
us—I tell them to look at the change of mindset, the open information
sharing, and how quickly information passes around Bayer. Things
that otherwise may have taken two or three weeks to uncover, now take
hours.”11
220 LEADING DIGITAL
But business adoption of digital tools does not happen naturally.
It has to be led. So what do you need to do? It often starts with doing
fewer things better. You need to plan for adoption from the start—
taking into account people, process, and structural changes. Align
the investment required to achieve your intended benefits. It will cost
money. Aligning rewards and recognition is good practice. And as
we’ve shown earlier, so is leading by example.
Organizations that focus on the business adoption of digital tools
get better returns. Your active leadership in adoption will ensure that
your digital technology investments benefit the business as intended.
Learn to Fail
With the speed of technology change, your go-to-market and operational
processes will often be catapulted into uncharted territory. Not
everything you try will succeed. The adage “Fail fast, fail cheap, fail
often” is not new, but is very relevant to the business adoption of digital
technology. Of course, it’s not about encouraging failure. It’s about
promoting a culture where teams can learn quickly and smartly.
Experimentation can steer you in the right direction. Digital
technology enables a multitude of ways to experiment with new business
ideas, at relatively low cost. With the right control mechanisms
in place, it also provides a continuous stream of data to measure, learn
from, and enable adaptation. Time to market becomes more important
than perfection. Invariably, despite well-executed experiments,
some initiatives will fail to deliver as planned. But this is part of the
game.
The important thing is to learn from these failures and, in subsequent
attempts, leverage the knowledge gained. Kim Stevenson, CIO
of Intel, instituted a simple program to encourage informed risk-taking
in her organization. She distributes small cards that read: “I took a risk,
it failed, and I learned something and applied it.” Each card is a license
to experiment and take a risk. When a project fails, team members turn
in a card to their manager; managers then decide whether to give the
Mobilizing the Organization 221
card back.12 Failure can be a learning opportunity—consider it part of
the process.
Institutionalize New Work Practices
Use the power of digital tools to the limit of their capabilities.
Encourage new work practices to become the routine way your organization
works. Sourcing your internal crowd can both help harness
the power of your organization and send a signal that everyone matters,
not just the select few on the management committee. Sainsbury,
the British-based retailer, runs a panel of more than two thousand
employees who give feedback every month about key managerial decisions.
13 Even the process of innovation is being transformed by new
digital tools: crowdsourcing, broadcast search, and open innovation. So
you need to institute these tools one by one across your organization in
search of productivity and efficiency.
But how do you make these changes stick and become routine?
You need to adapt your management and people processes to institutionalize
the new practices. This should be a key opportunity for
your HR or organization development functions to take a leadership
role in the transformation. Unfortunately, our research shows that all
too often, the employees in these functions don’t rise to the task. So
challenge them and ask yourself, “Do I have the right support for my
ambitions?”
You have signaled the change to your organization, you have
engaged communities and champions, and you are actively cultivating
new behaviors to move closer to a digital business. Your mobilization
task should be well on its way.
So what’s new with mobilizing in digital transformation? You
can mobilize at scale, whatever the size or complexity of your organization.
You can co-design your transformation plans by engaging a
wider community. Digital champions who drive the change can be of
any age or tenure, not just senior leaders. Even more than in the past,
Â�experimentation and tolerance for failure are part of the digital game.

(1 = strongly disagree; 4 = neutral; 7 = strongly agree). For each of the
three steps, total your scores across the individual questions.
For each step, we have provided you with a target that places you
among the Digital Masters. We’ve also provided a threshold below
which you should start taking action now to improve your situation. If
your score is in the Digital Master range, you are ready to move on. If
your score is in the middle range, reflect on why. Your team still needs
to work out a few things in the mobilizing phase. If your score is below
the average of the rest of the sample, it is time for remedial actions. If it
is well below, we recommend you design and conduct a full mobilization
program with your top team.

SUSTAINING THE DIGITAL
TRANSFORMATION
Large transformation programs often fail to reach their goals because
they lose their momentum. Digital transformation is no different. It’s
easy to stay motivated in the early days—T-shirts, baseball caps, regular
video communications, visible engagement programs, quick wins,
best practices sharing, and new leadership roles. But as time goes by,
change fatigue sets in and new ways of working begin to give in to the
old way of doing things.
This is the time where skills gaps become obvious; where unaligned
metrics and incentives get in the way of doing the right thing; and where
leadership teams, busy planning the next strategic move, too often assume
that the digital transition is flying on autopilot on its way to completion.
These can be dangerous times. Until new digital practices are rooted
into your customer experience, your operations, and your ways of working,
there is a real danger that the momentum of your digital transformation
will start faltering. Without a concerted effort to sustain the transformation
program, your vision and your business objectives may be at risk. Joe
Gross of insurer Allianz Group explained: “I think the top challenge for
Allianz will be to maintain and accelerate the momentum that we have
already generated. It’s still an evolving process—we cannot hope to see
immediate results. It’s also easy for organizations to slip back into old,
226 LEADING DIGITAL
familiar patterns. The challenge for us is not to go back to our comfort
zones and instead always keep Â�looking for new digital opportunities.”1
What can we learn from Digital Masters about making digital
transformations sustainable? Ensuring that you are managing three
aspects of your digital transition will help sustain the momentum of
your transformation. Ask yourself the following questions:
• Building foundation capabilities: Do you have a plan for a rampup
of digital competence within your organization? Do you
have a well-structured digital platform? Do you have strong
Â�IT–Â�business relationships?

• Aligning reward structures: Are your incentives, rewards, and
Â�recognitions aligned to your transformation objectives?
• Measuring, monitoring, and iterating: Do you have a
Â�management process that allows you to measure and Â�
monitor the progress of your digital transformation?
Do you have enough visibility to adapt your course as
needed?
ARE YOU BUILDING FOUNDATIONAL
CAPABILITIES?
Technology innovation is outpacing many firms’ ability to build
organizational capabilities fast enough. In chapter 8 we showed
that Digital Masters build three solid foundations to sustain their
digital transformation. They build digital skills—the experience
and knowledge of people. They build a well-structured digital platform—
the assembly of technology to power their business processes.
And they develop strong IT–business relationships—trusted, shared,
and integrated interactions between technology and businesspeople.
Orchestrate Your Skills Build-Up
Building digital skills is a gradual process. There’s no silver bullet, so
getting it right won’t happen overnight. You need to craft a capability
building and organization development plan meshing several complementary
approaches—hiring, training, partnering, acquiring, or
incubating.
But first, you need to understand what your skills gap is. At operational
levels, you need to first conduct a proper skill inventory assessment
to understand the retooling required in your key functions:
what you have today, what your digital transformation requires, and
the skill gap that needs to be filled. Ask your HR organization to
take a lead on this. And consider all tactics at your disposal.
228 LEADING DIGITAL
Hiring
The ability to make good hires is the most obvious tool. External hiring
is effective in bringing both digital leadership skills to the senior levels
and specific capabilities in the more operational roles.
Start at the top. When you are trying to build up digital skills in your
company, bringing in digital awareness and experience at the board
level is useful. For example, in 2012, Coca-Cola added Robert Kotick,
CEO of game company Activision Blizzard, to its board. Muhtar
Kent, chairman and CEO, explained: “Bobby brings an entrepreneurial
mindset and a high level of financial literacy and digital knowledge to
our company. His global brand expertise and insight will be invaluable
as we continue to grow our business and invest in enhancing our digital
engagement with consumers and customers around the world.”2 Many
organizations also bring in experienced executives to inject digital leadership
in their senior executive team. Nestlé, the food giant, brought
in Pete Blackshaw as global head of digital and social media in 2011
to harmonize and accelerate the company’s digital marketing strategy.3
Innovate in your recruitment strategy. Use all of the recruitment
channels that digital technologies bring today—social media, online
recruitment agencies, and other online communities—as well as more
traditional routes. L’Oréal, for instance, developed “Reveal,” a recruitment
website that takes the form of a business game.4 Not surprisingly,
digital-savvy Generation Y candidates preferred to be engaged through
digital means—49 percent of candidates are more likely to consider
a job advertised in an innovative way.5
Cast your net wide for rare skills. Go and get talents where they are.
Look outside your own industry to acquire valuable skills, or partner
with academic institutions to get early exposure. This is what Caesars
did when it needed to beef up its quantitative skills. The company identified
the companies that were, at the time, the most advanced in terms
of analytics skills—many were in the financial services sector. Caesars
proceeded to attract candidates from these companies to build a solid
set of core analytical skills.
Sustaining the Digital Transformation 229
Training
Training is essential to grow your capabilities from within. Many of
your existing employees will be eager to embark on their personal
Â�digital journeys to grow their skills. Training comes in several flavors:
digital awareness programs, specific digital skills training and certification,
employee exchange programs, reverse mentoring, and even your
own internal digital university.
Increase your digital awareness. L’Oréal, for example, wanted to
increase digital awareness in several functions, including marketing,
research, manufacturing, communication, and sales. The company
launched a specific program to train fifteen thousand individuals,
including managers, in digital fluency in two years.6
Bring employees up to speed in specific digital technologies. Intel started
a Digital IQ training program comprising sixty online courses spanning
diverse areas, from social media measurement to brand identity.
Its success led the company to launch an internal certification called the
Digital IQ 500, which licenses employees to practice social media on
behalf of the company.7
Organize employee exchange programs. Such programs can also be a
good way for your company to leverage key partners to improve digital
skills. P&G, for example, started an employee exchange program with
Google. Employees from both companies participate in each other’s
training programs and business meetings.8 This program enabled select
P&G employees to gain expertise on digital and search marketing. On
the other hand, for Google, which controls about 74 percent of searchterm
advertising spending, the exchange enables Google employees to
gain insight into the working practices and culture of the world’s biggest
advertiser.9
Introduce reverse-mentoring programs. Originally pioneered by GE,
reverse mentoring is also a great way to pair your digital-savvy employees
with executives in a nonhierarchical way. Krish Shankar, head of
HR at Indian telecommunications group Bharti Airtel, explained:
“The future of technology will be defined by the youth, and unless we
230 LEADING DIGITAL
talk to the younger generation and observe them closely, we will not
know their demands. A [reverse-mentoring] program like this sends a
message that no matter how high up you are, you are never too old to
learn.”10
Consider building your own digital university. Kering, the luxurybrands
holding company, set up its own in-house digital academy to
increase digital skills globally. The focus is threefold: to develop brand
innovation, to build digital awareness among managers, and to create
an international community around digital transformation across the
group.11
Partnering
Partnerships can be very effective when you’re lacking critical skills that
your ecosystem partners already possess. Angela Ahrendts, Burberry’s
CEO, explained: “We began sharing our vision of our ecosystem with
our technology partners. We told them: Burberry is global, dynamic,
and has a clear vision. We have an amazing CTO and an IT team that’s
nimble and fast. So our proposal was: let us be your R&D. Let’s experiment
together.”12
Partnerships can also be effective for accessing specific skills critical
to your product or service innovation. GE, for instance, partnered
with Quirky, a social product-development company. The partnership
enables the Quirky product-development community to access GE’s
patents and accelerate advanced innovations in manufacturing. In
return, GE encourages product innovation that builds on GE technology
without fear of potential infringement.13 With proper skill-transfer
mechanisms, partnering can be very effective.
Acquiring (or “Acqui-Hires”)
You can acquire generally small companies purely for their talent.
When Walmart Labs wanted to strengthen its offerings across mobile
and social media channels, it acquired a range of mobile-related
agencies that were focused on product development.14 When other
methods are too slow or when skills are rare, acquisitions can be the
Sustaining the Digital Transformation 231
answer. But, as with any people-based acquisition, they can be risky to
implement.
Incubating
Through incubation, you invest in agile start-ups while providing them
access to your company’s technical and executive support. By opening
up your resources to such start-ups, you can access specialized talent
that would otherwise be tough to source. Mondelez, the global snack
company, launched its Mobile Futures incubator in 2011 to harness
mobile marketing start-up capabilities. The company hopes to launch
mobile-focused tech companies out of the process. But more importantly,
it wants to garner new capabilities—such as in-store marketing,
location-based advertising, and social-TV applications—to drive innovation.
15 If you want to infuse entrepreneurial spirit and access stateof-
the-art digital skills, an incubator model can be very helpful, but it
requires strong program management to succeed.
Building strong digital skills is essential to secure the sustainability of
your digital transformation program. In some areas, you will need to
build capabilities at scale, while in other areas, you may need to target
very narrow skills. There is no shortage of methods of how you can get
there. What matters is the impact on execution. You need a clear plan,
investment, and a concerted implementation with your functions and
business units. And don’t do it alone. You need your HR and organizational
development teams by your side and mandated to implement
this complex capability shift.
Build Your Digital Platform
Earlier in the book we described how important it is to have a strong
digital platform. Why? Because a well-defined and well-managed platform
provides you with the information you need to make decisions
and the coordination you need to power your processes as effectively as
possible. Great digital platforms are at the same time a bridge to your
232 LEADING DIGITAL
customers and a gateway to your internal and third-party Â�processes.
When it’s good, your platform enables you to personalize your customer
interactions, perform analytics, optimize your internal processes,
manage seamlessly across channels, and have a single view of your
customers.
A digital platform is a coherent set of business processes, along with
supporting infrastructure, applications, and data, intended to ensure
the quality and predictability of core transactions.16 It should be well
defined, well managed, and only as complex as necessary. Great digital
platforms make your company’s business processes more efficient,
less risky, and more agile.17 Unfortunately, in many large companies,
the platform is a mess of spaghetti—overly complex, expensive to run,
tough to change, and prone to failure.
If you hope to transform your customer engagements or operations,
you’ll need to start by transforming your platform. It’s what Angela
Ahrendts of Burberry did when launching her digital transformation
program. It’s what Lloyds Banking Group did in setting the stage for
new digital banking capabilities. And it’s what, in all likelihood, you’ll
have to do as you get started.
What does it take to build the right digital platform? A useful
approach is to think in terms of an enterprise architecture—a roadmap
explaining the desired organizing logic of your business processes and
underlying technology.18 Many people find it helpful to think of their
enterprise architecture in three different, but coordinated, layers. First,
you need a technical architecture comprising existing applications and
new ones, as well as the underlying infrastructure for processing, storage,
and communication. Some technologies will be managed by you,
some by your partners, and some by third-party suppliers—often cloudbased.
You also need a business process architecture to understand your
desired level of integration and standardization across different parts
of the company, and how your business processes make your company
work. You should be able to map your current state to your future state
with the technical and organizational changes that will be required to
get there. Increasingly, companies are building a data architecture. This
Sustaining the Digital Transformation 233
is an understanding of your content—how information is produced and
how it is distributed. Is it structured or unstructured? How will it be
used for transactions and for analytics? How will you manage requirements
for security, privacy, and data retention? How can you get to a
unified view of your customers, processes, and performance?
To move your platform in the right direction, you will need strong
digital governance. An effective governance model both rejects requests
that will add unnecessary complexity and facilitates initiatives that will
improve the platform’s capabilities. Governance is essential to build a
platform that is standardized enough to provide efficiency and enable
changes that affect the whole company, like the platform at pharmacy
retailer CVS that we discussed in chapter 8. It should also provide ways
that different units can customize parts of the platform or innovate on
top of it, as local hotels can do with Caesars Entertainment’s corporate
web platform.
Building world-class digital platforms is not a job just for your CIO
and his or her technical team. They can’t do it on their own. It’s a job
for you and other business executives, working in tandem with your IT
leaders. You need the discipline to follow standards and avoid unnecessary
exceptions, and the savvy to envision new ways you can work with
a great platform and new technologies. Your IT leaders can be valuable
partners in helping you build this platform, if you are willing to engage
with them.
Develop a Close IT–Business Relationship
In the long-distant past, we were taught that IT was the keeper of technology
and that IT leaders were service providers to the rest of the business.
Their job was to stay aligned with business strategy, taking orders
from the business and delivering new systems. If they kept the systems
running and delivered projects on time, then all was good. That time is
over, and it has been for many years.
To be effective, digital transformation demands a fusion between IT
and business skills. It requires mutual trust and shared understanding. It also
234 LEADING DIGITAL
requires new methods of working—agile learning-by-doing approaches
for fast-moving, customer-facing Â�innovations; Â�more-systematic methods
for more-critical and longer-lasting projects, and the wisdom to mix the
methods appropriately.
Years of separation can get in the way of building the strong relationships
you need. In many organizations, the interaction will not
come naturally. But moving from a poor relationship to a state of true
partnership between IT and business leaders is possible. We’ve seen
it dozens of times in companies around the world, and there are good
guides to help you create that partnership.19 Unfortunately, achieving
the new partnership takes time and effort. Your digital transformation
may need to start before you have completely changed the culture of,
and the relationship between, IT and business leaders across your organization.
We’ve seen some Digital Masters take different approaches
to begin improving the IT–business relationship. Some efforts are topdown,
some are project-based, some are governance-based, and some
are organizational.
Top-Down
Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts mandated that the CIO would be part
of the senior management team. But just putting him on the team was
not enough. She worked closely with him to help him develop into a
new role. And she was very clear that the members of her team needed
to work on the relationship from their own business-oriented sides.20
This worked, because the senior-most executive in the company led the
IT/business fusion.
Project-Based
Some companies take a Skunk Works approach to digital innovation
projects. They extract the resources required from business and IT to
deliver a specific initiative for a limited duration. This has the advantage
of being easy to set up. But although a project-based approach
improves communication, it does not commit the two communities to
work together over time.
Sustaining the Digital Transformation 235
Governance-Based
Strong governance processes require an integrated IT and business
approach to vetting and conducting projects. An integrated approach
helps IT and business executives spend time together and to jointly
identify how they’ll make their initiatives happen. Making business
leaders accountable for the financial results of technology projects is
one good way to ensure that IT and business are in sync. In a large
apparel company, for example, if a unit needs funding for a digital initiative,
the president of the business unit makes the pitch directly to an
executive steering committee and is required to give a specific, measurable
return target. Then, after implementation, the unit president must
go in front of his or her colleagues and show whether the return was
achieved, as well as why. This kind of accountability drives stronger
links between technology and business executives, since the credibility
of the business executive depends on working closely with IT to make
results happen.
Organizational
Some organizational changes can start to dissolve the distance between
IT and business units. For example, TetraPak aligns its IT and businesspeople
around strong business process ownership. The business process
owner controls what changes will be made to processes, and coordinates
IT and businesspeople to make them happen. Other companies
have made technology and operations people report to the same senior
executive. Meanwhile, other companies have created specific organizational
units to deliver their digital roadmaps. This unit, such as Nike
Digital Sport or the one at Lloyds Banking Group, may have its own
resources or a combination of owned and shared resources. Or it may be
a dual-speed IT arrangement as we discussed in chapter 8.
Whatever the model, getting your IT and business leaders to work more
closely together—in an environment of trust, shared Â�understanding,
and collaboration—is a prerequisite for sustaining your transformation
and gaining the digital advantage of Digital Masters.
236 LEADING DIGITAL
ARE YOUR REWARD STRUCTURES ALIGNED
TO YOUR TRANSFORMATION GOALS?
Your company’s transformation goals and measures are Â�inextricably
linked. Reward structures are the glue that binds them. Many of the
challenges labeled as “resistance to change” during a transformation
are actually conflicts about measures and rewards. For that reason,
two-thirds of Digital Masters in our survey have explicitly tied reward
Â�structures to their digital transformation goals.21 Digital transformation
gives business leaders a good opportunity to reassess the Â�combination
of financial and nonfinancial incentives that will best serve the company’s
goals. You need to calibrate your reward structures to overcome
conflicts and sustain your digital transformation.
Start at the Top
We’ve shown in the framing phase the importance of aligning the top
team around a vision. We’ve also discussed the cross-functional nature
of digital transformation throughout the book. A collective top team
incentive—based on the success or the progress of your digital transformation—
is often a good way to facilitate this alignment.
Smooth End-to-End Operations
Operations can constitute a real challenge to aligning digital transformation
goals. How can you ensure end-to-end delivery of your core
processes or smooth the interface between functions and business units?
Some conflicts in your reward structures will be obvious from the early
stage, and you will need to fix them. But many won’t. They will occur
as you get into the depth of your digital conversion. You need to remain
alert, as they will act like bottlenecks or excuses for slowing down your
transformation efforts. Employee resistance to change was cited as one
of the biggest hurdles to implementing digital Â�transformation in our
initial phase of interviews.22
Sustaining the Digital Transformation 237
Consider the retail sector as an illustration. Online channels are
fast gaining more traction. One of the biggest challenges facing retailers
today is integrating online and offline channels. In 2011, Walmart
defined new incentives for its store managers and employees. These
people now had to push online sales from their respective territories,
just as they did for in-store sales. Following this alignment of rewards,
employees started promoting Walmart.com, the new iPad app, and the
My Local Walmart Facebook app to the 140 million weekly in-store
shoppers.23
Similarly, John Lewis, the chain of department stores in the United
Kingdom, rolled out a Click and Collect strategy whereby shoppers can
collect their online purchases from a brick-and-mortar store. In order
to effectively drive offline-online store coordination, the company
attributes online sales to the relevant customer’s local store. Store managers
became accountable not just for in-store sales, but also for overall
internet sales in their catchment area. This change motivated managers
to influence customers to purchase products from the website. After
rolling out its Click and Collect strategy, John Lewis witnessed a significant
increase in sales across its online channels. A third of all online
orders are now collected in John Lewis or Waitrose (food retail division
of John Lewis) stores.24
Make Sure the Rewards Are More Than Financial
The reward structures for sustaining digital transformation should
not be just financial. Intangible incentives such as status, reputation,
recognition, expertise, and privileges are great managerial levers to
drive employee motivation, productivity, and ultimately reach your
transformation goals.25 Indeed, research suggests that nonfinancial
motivators are sometimes more effective than financial rewards in
fostering employee engagement.26 For example, as we discussed earlier,
Chilean mining company Codelco and technology company
EMC created internal innovation awards to promote new ideas,
238 LEADING DIGITAL
encourage workers to innovate, and consequently effect a culture
change.
Digital technologies are also enabling new forms of incentives, such
as gamification.27 Intangible rewards, such as recognition and real-time
feedback, provided through gamification initiatives, can yield positive
results. When a midsized firm installed a new event-logging system
for its sales force, the firm found very poor adoption rates from its
employees. To rectify this, the company ran a weeklong sales competition
where every event logged would receive a point and the employee
accruing the highest number of points would receive a $100 gift certificate
at a local restaurant. The number of events shot up by 750 percent.
Even four weeks into the contest, events logged were six times higher
than previous levels.28
Extend Reward Structures Beyond Your Corporate Boundary
Part of your digital transformation may require that you extend reward
structures beyond your own corporate boundary to suppliers, partners,
or even customers. Samsung, the Korean electronics giant, wanted to
increase customer advocacy on its Samsung.com portal. The company
rolled out a social incentive program, using gamification techniques,
to measure, recognize, and reward key customer advocates who could
promote Samsung products to their networks. By looking beyond the
corporation, Samsung turned passive web visitors into active brand
advocates. The site recorded a 500 percent increase in reviews and
200 percent more comments.29
Sustaining your digital transformation program will be highly influenced
by your ability to align your reward and recognition structures
to your goals. It is a complex, multidimensional challenge. Not all the
misalignments will be obvious from the start, so you will have to tackle
them in stages. But the benefits will outweigh the difficulties. Rewards
drive behavior, for better or for worse. And changing people’s behavior
is what, ultimately, will drive culture change in your organization.
Sustaining the Digital Transformation 239
ARE YOU MEASURING AND MONITORING
YOUR DIGITAL PROGRESS?
The old management adage “You can’t manage what you can’t measure”
is as true for digital transformation as it is for any other business activity.
Digital transformation can’t be sustained through just an act of faith
from your senior team. Having a proper measurement and monitoring
system in place will provide you with confidence that the investments and
the business change are bringing real benefits to your organization. In
addition, over two-thirds of executives we surveyed think that measurements
have a critical effect on changing the culture of an organization.30
Therefore, metrics should constitute the backbone of your transformation
program and the instrument panel with which to guide it.
How does measurement work? There are four basic steps to properly
measuring and monitoring progress: managing your strategic
scorecard, driving an initiative-level business case and KPIs to measure
the progress of your digital initiatives, connecting top-down and initiative-
level measures, and developing an iterative review process.
Managing Your Strategic Scorecard
Keeping track of your strategic scorecard is the task of senior management.
Earlier in the investment-focusing phase, we saw the importance
of translating your vision into strategic goals that reflect the final state
of what you are trying to achieve. Financial measures will play a big
part. But your strategic scorecard should also contain digital goals for
customer experience, for operational processes, and for the organizational
capabilities that you need to build. The scorecard should provide
a basic template for your entire digital transformation effort. You need
to manage individual components of your scorecard actively to ensure
the balanced progress of your transformation.
A multibrand global company wanted to review the Â�progress of its
digital transformation program, so the executive team Â�implemented
an executive digital dashboard to ensure proper focus on the right
240 LEADING DIGITAL
objectives and oversight on the companywide Â�transformation.
The company went further by building a virtual digital P&L that
included all online activities across the group, independently of the
entity that actually generates the revenue or incurs the cost. The
executive team also set up a Digital Transformation Index as a compound
measure to monitor progress of each business unit. But not
everything is top-down.
Drive the Initiative-Level Business Case and Related KPIs
In chapter 10, we also highlighted the need to quantify and monitor the
benefits of your digital roadmap—by engaging employees with the right
expertise to provide rigor and commitment to the exercise. Clear business
cases also act as great motivators for people to transform the business.
Your KPIs will come in different flavors. Some will be high level,
and some, very granular. Typically, your process-driven performance
measures will be captured by a few key metrics, such as online creditcard
application-to-issue time. Others will be more related to experiments
and proofs of concept, such as measuring the impact of an online
ad campaign on Facebook. The key is to choose the metrics that are
critical to attain your long-term transformation objectives.
Connect Top-Down and Initiative-Level Measures
By connecting your top-down and initiative-level measures, you build
a coherent business management process. You need to make clear how
each of your digital initiatives contributes to your transformation goals
and strategic scorecard. You must also understand the cause and effect
of each initiative. Establishing such a measurement cascade will ensure
that the teams remain focused on delivering the vision and that business
leaders have visibility of the business impact.
Develop an Iterative Review Process
An iterative review will allow you to monitor progress and correct your
course when necessary. The review needs to be conducted rigorously
Sustaining the Digital Transformation 241
and frequently, and with the flexibility that digital programs demand.
Digital transformation requires constant adaptation as new Â�technology
appears and as your teams discover and test new opportunities for
improvement. Traditional sectors are learning quickly from born-Â�digital
companies. For example, the UK government recently embarked on a
Digital by Default program. Mike Bracken, head of the Government
Digital Services, explained the government’s new iterative approach in
the digital space: “Do it quick, fail fast, learn your lessons and continue
to change—that’s why you need the skills inside the organization.”31
At the executive level, the iterative review process will help you to
choose and prioritize new initiatives—which ones advance your transformation
goals, and which are peripheral. It will also help you kill
those that do not lead to real benefits. At the operational level, it will
ensure that critical digital initiatives are progressing to plan, and raise
early warnings when organizational bottlenecks get in the way.
Sustaining the momentum of your digital transformation is critical to
long-term success. It requires building new foundation skills that will
make the change possible, aligning reward structures to ensure that
employees are motivated and organizational bottlenecks are removed,
and putting in place an iterative review process to measure progress frequently.
When enthusiasm tapers off and you start to encounter more
resistance from within your organization, these sustaining interventions
will become essential to help you stay the course.
So what’s new with sustaining your transformation in a digital
world? Even more than in the past, it is essential to truly integrate
your technology and business capabilities. Ramping up digital capabilities
faster than your competitors is a source of advantage. Building
a coherent digital platform will speed up transformation. Digital transformation
demands a new fusion of IT and business skills. Aligning
online and offline incentives and rewards is more important than ever,
and will remove bottlenecks. Digital technology has enabled new
forms of incentives, such as gamification. Connecting your top-down
and Â�initiative-level digital metrics will make clear how your digital
Â�initiatives contribute to your transformation goals.
242 LEADING DIGITAL
So, is this end of the journey? Absolutely not. Although you, and
your organization, will have applied the approaches that have given
Digital Masters the digital advantage, the transformation is never
Â�finished. Even if you become a Digital Master, you will need to work to
remain one. In the epilogue, we will explain why.
HOW WELL IS YOUR ORGANIZATION
SUSTAINING DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION?
Table 12.1 summarizes how you can sustain the digital challenge in
three key steps. Look at the central questions at each step, and give an
honest assessment of your company’s progress on a scale from 1 to 7
(1 = strongly disagree; 4 = neutral; 7 = strongly agree). For each of the
three steps, total your scores across the individual questions.
For each step, we have provided you with a target that places you
among the Digital Masters. We’ve also provided a threshold below
which you should start taking action now to improve your situation.
If your score is in the Digital Master range, you are ready to move on.
If your score is in the middle range, reflect on why. Your team still
needs to work out a few things in the sustaining phase. If your score
is in the lower range, it is time for remedial actions. If it is well below,
you run the risk of early burnout. We recommend that you take action
on capabilities, rewards, and measurements to make sure your program
becomes sustainable.

EPILoGuE
YOU AIN’T SEEN
NOTHIN’ YET
In this book, we’ve presented a case for why your organization should
strive to become a Digital Master—an enterprise that’s able to use each
new wave of technology to radically improve the performance or reach
of its business. Our research has shown that Digital Masters enjoy
superior performance, which should be reason enough to get leadership
teams interested in the concepts presented in this book. But there’s also
another, even more fundamental, reason: when it comes to the impact of
digital technologies on the business world, we ain’t seen nothin’ yet.
TECHNOLOGY: THE ENDLESS AGITATOR
OF THE BUSINESS WORLD
The innovations we’ve discussed in previous chapters, including social
networks, mobile devices, analytics, smart sensors, and cloud computing,
are certainly powerful and profound. They’re reshaping customer
experiences, operations, and business models. The pace and impact of
these innovations have been nothing short of astonishing, but they’re
just a prelude for what’s to come.
Technology’s role as the endless agitator of the business world will
not only continue, but will accelerate—exponentially. Moore’s Law
246 Epilogue
will continue to be the central drumbeat of the digital future.1 In five
years, technology will be about ten times as powerful as today, for the
same price. In ten years, the increase will be a hundredfold. If you find
yourself struggling to keep up with waves of change over the past few
years, you’re in for a rough ride. Keeping up will be even more difficult
in the future, unless you develop the skills of the Digital Masters.
The good news is that some of the next transformative technological
innovations are already on the horizon. They will continue to
reshape customer experiences and operations in fundamental ways.
We’ve seen Digital Masters hard at work figuring those out already.
The most significant innovation is the continuing business impact
of data and analytics—the explosive increase in the amount of information
available in digital form, and businesses’ ability to use new
insights to make smarter decisions. This is a fundamentally important
development because data is the lifeblood of science—of improving
our understanding of what causes what, and why, and under what circumstances.
In the years to come, smart organizations will use big data
to become better, smarter, and more rigorous at many key activities:
making predictions and forecasts; hiring and promoting people; deciding
on product attributes; optimizing internal processes; marketing
and advertising; and customizing products and services (to name just
a few). Companies that use big data to get better at these activities will
pull ahead of those that don’t, as sure as gamblers who know the odds
pull away from those who bet only on gut feel.
Gaining new analytic skills can’t happen fast enough, as companies
gather richer data on their customers and operations, as unstructured
data-analysis techniques open social media to investigation, and
as more and more devices report data through the “internet of things.”
How will your internal processes change when you have detailed information
on the full performance of processes and products in real time?
How will your hiring and HR processes change when you have this
kind of measurement for employees? How much better will you be able
to personalize your services through ever more granular insights into
customers’ needs and behavior?
Epilogue 247
Other waves of technology innovation will also be significant.
Robotics, additive manufacturing, augmented reality, and wearable
technology, among others, will fundamentally change the way businesses
operate. They will transform the nature of operations, customer
experience, and even business models.
Until recently, industrial robots were expensive, inflexible, and
dangerous if people had to work too close to them, but all of that is
changing. People work side by side with automatons in many factories
now, and human-robot collaborations are only getting closer.
Robots are rapidly getting better at seeing, feeling, and otherwise sensing
their environments, which enables them to take on more and more
work. And they’re escaping the factory floor and moving through the
economy; driverless cars and other autonomous vehicles are robots,
even though they’re not anthropomorphic. They’ll change the logistics
and transportation industries, not just the manufacturing ones. As
Watson, the computer that won the TV quiz show Jeopardy!, enters
law and medicine, what will that mean for the way those fields are
Â�managed? How will industrial robots change the shape of your supply
chain and logistics management?
Additive manufacturing (also called 3-D printing) will open up further
business opportunities. It holds the promise of giving companies
the ability to literally print out parts just as easily (if not yet as quickly)
as they now print out documents. These parts, which can be made from
several materials, including plastic and metal, can have highly complex
geometries; additive manufacturing is not constrained in the same
ways that traditional fabrication processes are. Already, 3-D printing is
being used intensively for prototyping and for small production runs of
specialized parts. It will expand much beyond these initial uses. How
will your inventory management processes change if you don’t have to
stock low-volume parts? How would your design and sales activities
change if you could print custom parts on demand?
Augmented reality meshes real-world environments with additional
data and presents a revised environment with computer-generated
sensory forms such as sounds, graphics, and video. This technology
248 Epilogue
will allow consumers to experience what your product or service has to
offer like never before. Trying on a new outfit in a virtual changing
room, changing its color, adding jewelry to dress it up, or asking your
friends on Facebook for comments—all will become the norm. Over
time, online shopping may become as immersive as visiting a store.
Augmented reality will also change your internal processes. For
instance, your field maintenance engineers could use tablets to visually
identify pieces of your infrastructure and automatically overlay all maintenance
records and procedures. In one major electronics firm, product
designers using 3-D augmented reality discovered that a wire harness
would rub repeatedly against another part, causing the harness to break
prematurely—a condition they could not see in their 2-D design software.
How could you use this technology to increase the prepurchase
experience for your customers? Could it help you substantially improve
the productivity of your operations?
Wearable technology, as commonly described today, is meshing
real-time monitoring and feedback technology with design and mobility.
Nike’s FuelBand, which we described earlier in this book, is an
example. Wearable items will track anything, from your sleep patterns
to your heart rhythms. Smart socks will monitor your running technique.
You may be able to change the color or thermal properties of
your T-shirt at will. Digitized eyewear, such Google Glass, will open
up exciting new possibilities. For instance, video images from inside
machines can be streamed directly to a technician’s eyewear, overlaying
machine specification data to sharpen diagnostics, while keeping the
worker’s hands free to conduct repairs. Could the constant monitoring
of how your customers use your products and services uncover new
sources of growth? Can you monetize the new data stream that wearable
technology brings? Have you considered how much more productive
your engineers and technicians could be if they used wearable
technology in your core operations?
Fast-moving technologies may also change the way you organize
and innovate. The so-called sharing economy is forcing a rethink of
large, asset-heavy industries, with important implications for the
Epilogue 249
business models of large firms. Open innovation can build communities
of interest, surface new sources of talent, and, for some problems,
make progress both more quickly and more cheaply than approaches
that rely on internal resources and centralized planning.2 Social media
and the seamless flow of data can bridge organizational boundaries and
flatten hierarchies. What is the role of middle management in a digitally
transformed enterprise? How might you overcome the nagging
limits in your traditional organizational model?
LEADING DIGITAL IS A JOB FOR NOW
Technology is reaching into every corner of the business world—every
industry, company, process, decision, and job—bringing deep changes
in how companies are structured and led, and how they perform and
compete. Over time, it will create a new playing field with new rules—
and new winners and losers.
It’s not yet clear exactly how any of the innovations we discussed
here will progress, or how broad and deep their impacts will be. We
think that, individually, each of them is likely to be a big deal indeed
in the business world. In combination, their effects will be hugely
transformational.
We’re also confident that other technologies will be even more
transformational; we just don’t know what they are. The history of
technological progress, and particularly progress with digital technologies,
is one of constant surprise. Who knew that, within one Â�generation,
the personal computer would become an indispensable tool for virtually
every knowledge worker? That a multimedia interface would turn the
internet from a geek’s network to the world’s connective tissue? That
phones would become an entirely new category of computing device?
That social media, a mere diversion ten years ago, would grow to billions
of connected people and become a vibrant organizing force that
could topple governments?
This work of innovative astonishment is nowhere near over. The
world abounds with ever more potential innovators, entrepreneurs,
250 Epilogue
inventors, tinkerers, and geeks, and they have access to more and more
increasingly powerful computing technologies all the time, at lower
and lower price points. These tech-savvy people are going to come
up with things that change the business world, and hence the world.
We’re not nearly good enough tech forecasters to predict what all of
these advances will be, but we’re fully confident that they’re coming.
We ain’t seen nothin’ yet.
The best way to get ready for these changes—in fact, probably
the only way—is to start the work of becoming a Digital Master now.
Companies that are indifferent to technology (to say nothing of hostile
to it), or that haven’t figured out how to make it part of the lifeblood
of the enterprise, are going to have an increasingly hard time as the
innovations keep mounting and the management breakthroughs keep
coming.
We’ve written this book as a guide to help you in the work of digital
mastery. It’s not a blueprint—a complete description of everything you
need to do to build the technologically adept company—because no
such blueprint exists. Every company is different, and so is every company’s
path to mastery. But the patterns we’ve seen among those who
do it well—the DNA of Digital Masters—can be helpful for any digital
transformation.
We hope that the examples, explanations, and frameworks we’ve
shared in Leading Digital will be useful to you and will help your organization
thrive in a new, digitally transformed, world.

DIGITAL MASTERY
SELF-ASSESSMENT
To get started in your digital transformation journey, you first need
to understand your starting point. Is your company a Digital Master
already? Or is somewhere else: Beginner, Fashionista, or Conservative?
We’ve created a simple quiz to help you understand your organization’s
level of digital mastery.
First, think about how your company uses digital technologies
such as social media, mobile, analytics, and embedded devices. Are you
building digital capabilities in customer experience or operations? Are
you digitally improving your existing business models or launching new
ones? Table A.1 can help you assess your digital capabilities.
Next, think about how well your company is leading digital transformation.
Do you have a shared transformative vision that is engaging
your employees? Are you governing the transformation correctly? Do
you have solid technology leadership capabilities in place? Table A.2

preface
The rules of business have changed. In every industry, the spread of new
digital technologies and the rise of new disruptive threats are transforming
business models and processes. The digital revolution has turned the old
business playbook upside down.
In my own work, teaching and advising business leaders from companies
around the world, I repeatedly hear the same urgent question: How do
we adapt and transform for the digital age?
Businesses founded before the rise of the Internet face a stark challenge:
Many of the fundamental rules and assumptions that governed and
grew their businesses in the pre-digital era no longer hold. The good news
is that change is possible. Pre-digital businesses are not dinosaurs doomed
to extinction. Their disruption is not inevitable. Businesses can transform
themselves to thrive in the digital age.
In this book I explore the phenomenon of digital transformation: What
separates businesses that manage to adapt and thrive in a digital world from
those who fail?
In pursuing the answers to this question, I have been privileged to draw
on the insights, perspectives, and questions of an amazing range of executives
and entrepreneurs, both through my consulting and keynote speaking,
and in my Columbia Business School executive programs on digital
x PREFACE
marketing and digital business strategy. I have been able to conduct research
studies on big data and marketing metrics, mobile shopping behaviors,
the Internet of Things, and the future of data sharing. And for nine
years, as founder of the BRITE conference, I have convened C-suite leaders
from global brands, technology firms, media companies, and fast-growing
startups to discuss the evolving digital business landscape.
One central insight emerged and shaped the development of this entire
book: Digital transformation is not about technology—it is about strategy
and new ways of thinking. Transforming for the digital age requires your
business to upgrade its strategic mindset much more than its IT infrastructure.
This truth is apparent in the changing roles of technology leadership
within business. A Chief Information Officer’s traditional role has been to
use technology to optimize processes, reduce risks, and better run the existing
business. But the emerging role of a Chief Digital Officer is much more
strategic, focused on using technology to reimagine and reinvent the core
business itself.
Digital transformation requires a holistic view of business strategy. In
my last book, The Network Is Your Customer, I focused on the impact of
digital technologies on customers—their behaviors, interactions, and relationships
with businesses and organizations of all kinds. In this book, I take
a broader scope, looking at five domains of business strategy: customers,
competition, data, innovation, and value.
Like my previous books, The Digital Transformation Playbook focuses
on practical tools and frameworks that readers can apply in making decisions
and formulating strategies for their own business, no matter their
size or industry. I have packed the text with case studies that illustrate the
concepts and illuminate the strategies. My hope is that you, the reader, will
bring the playbook into action by applying its lessons and discovering the
next stage of value creation and growth for your business.

THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION PLAYBOOK

The Five Domains of Digital
Transformation
Customers, Competition, Data,
Innovation, Value
You may remember the Encyclopædia Britannica. First published in 1768,
it represented the definitive reference resource in English for hundreds
of years before the rise of the Internet. Those of us of a certain age likely
remember thumbing through the pages of its thirty-two leather-bound
volumes—if not at home, then in a school library—while preparing a
research paper. In the initial debate about Wikipedia, and in the later stories
of its amazing rise, that vast, online, community-created, freely accessible
encyclopedia for the digital age was always compared to the Britannica, the
traditional incumbent that it was challenging.
When, after 244 years, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., announced it
had printed its last edition, the message seemed clear. Another hidebound
company born before the arrival of the Internet had been disrupted—
wiped out by the irrefutable logic of the digital revolution. Except that
wasn’t true.
Over the preceding twenty years, Britannica had been through a
wrenching process of transformation. Wikipedia was not, in fact, its first
digital challenger. At the dawn of the personal computing era, Britannica
sought to shift from print to CD-ROM editions of its product and suddenly
faced competition from Microsoft, a company in a totally different
2 T H E F I V E D O M A I N S O F D I G I TAL TRANSFORMATION
industry: Microsoft’s Encarta encyclopedia was a loss leader, given away
free on CD-ROM with purchases of Windows software as part of a larger
strategy to position personal computers as the primary educational investment
for middle-class families. As CD-ROMs gave way to the World Wide
Web, Britannica faced competition from an explosion of online information
sources, including Nupedia and later its exponentially growing, crowdsourced
successor, Wikipedia.
Britannica understood that customers’ behaviors were changing dramatically
with the adoption of new technologies. Rather than trying to
defend its old business model, the company’s leaders sought to understand
the needs of its core customers—home users and educational institutions,
increasingly in the K–12 market. Britannica experimented with various
delivery media, price points, and sales channels for its products. But, significantly,
it maintained a focus on its core mission: editorial quality and
educational service. With this focus, it was able not only to pivot to a purely
online subscription model for its encyclopedia but also to develop new and
related product offerings to meet the evolving needs for classroom curricula
and learning.
“By the time we stopped publishing the print set, the sales represented
only about 1% of our business,” explained Britannica President Jorge Cauz
on the anniversary of that decision. “We’re as profitable now as we’ve ever
been.”1
The story of Britannica may seem surprising precisely because the setup
is so familiar: powerful new digital technologies drive dramatic changes in
customer behavior. Once started, the digitization of a product, interaction,
or medium becomes irresistible. The old business model is invalidated.
Inflexible and unable to adapt, the “dinosaur” business gets wiped out. The
future belongs to the new digital pioneers and start-ups.
But that’s not what happened with Britannica, and that’s not how it has
to be for your business.
There is absolutely no reason upstart digital companies have to supplant
established firms. There is no reason new businesses have to be the
only engines of innovation. Established companies, like Britannica, can
set the pace. The problem is that—in many cases—management simply
doesn’t have a playbook to follow to understand and then address
the competitive challenges of digitization. This book is that playbook,
intended to help you understand, strategize for, and compete on the digital
playing field.
T H E F I V E D O M A I N S O F D I G I TAL TRANSFORMATION3
Overcoming Your Digital Blind Spots
An analogy may be helpful here. Back during the first wave of the Industrial
Revolution, factories were dependent on fixed sources of power—first,
water power from waterwheels located along rivers and, later, steam power
from coal-fired engines. Although these power sources enabled the rise of
mass production, they set fundamental constraints as well. At the outset,
they dictated where plants could be located and how productive they could
be. Furthermore, because both waterwheels and steam engines demanded
that all equipment in a factory be attached to a central drive shaft—a single
long motor that powered every machine—these power sources dictated the
design of factories and the way work could be done within them.
With the spread of electrification to factories at the end of the nineteenth
century, all of this changed. Electrical power eliminated all the constraints
that had defined factories up until that point. Machinery could be
arranged in the optimal order of work. Lines of production could feed into
each other, like tributaries to a river, rather than all fitting in along one
line shaft. Factory size was no longer limited by the maximum length of
line shafts and belts. The possibilities for entirely new plant designs were
breathtaking. And yet the incumbent plant owners were largely blind to
these opportunities. They were so used to the assumptions and constraints
of hundreds of years of plant design that they simply could not see the possibilities
before them.
It fell to the new electrical utilities, the “start-ups” of the electrification
era, to evangelize for innovation in manufacturing. These new firms
loaned electric motors for free to manufacturers just to get them to try the
new technology. They sent trainers and engineers, also for free, to train the
managers and workers at plants so that they could see how electric motors
could transform their business. Progress was slow at first, but it turned out
the utilities could teach some old dogs new tricks. By the 1920s, a new ecosystem
of factories, workers, engineers, products, and businesses had taken
shape, with electrical power at its center.2
Today, our digital-born businesses (such as Google or Amazon) are
like the electrical companies of the early electrification era. And our savvy
digital adopters (such as Britannica) are like the factories that learned to
retool and advance into the next industrial age. Both types of businesses
recognize the possibilities created by digital technologies. Both see that
4 T H E F I V E D O M A I N S O F D I G I TAL TRANSFORMATION
the constraints of the pre-digital era have vanished, making new business
models, new revenue streams, and new sources of competitive advantage
not only possible but also cheaper, faster, and more customer-centric than
ever before.
Let’s take a closer look at that world.
Five Domains of Strategy That Digital Is Changing
If electrification was transformative because it changed the fundamental
constraints of manufacturing, then the impact of digital is even bigger
because it changes the constraints under which practically every domain
of business strategy operates.
Digital technologies change how we connect and create value with our
customers. We may have grown up in a world in which companies broadcast
messages and shipped products to customers. But today the relationship
is much more two-way: customers’ communications and reviews make
them a bigger influencer than advertisements or celebrities, and customers’
dynamic participation has become a critical driver of business success.
Digital technologies transform how we need to think about competition.
More and more, we are competing not just with rival companies from
within our industry but also with companies from outside our industry that
are stealing customers away with their new digital offerings. We may find
ourselves competing fiercely with a long-standing rival in one area while
leveraging that company’s capabilities by cooperating in another sector of
our business. Increasingly, our competitive assets may no longer reside in
our own organization; rather, they may be in a network of partners that we
bring together in looser business relationships.
Digital technologies have changed our world perhaps most significantly
in how we think about data. In traditional businesses, data was expensive to
obtain, difficult to store, and utilized in organizational silos. Just managing
this data required that massive IT systems be purchased and maintained
(think of the enterprise resource planning systems required just to track
inventory from a factory in Thailand to goods sold at a mall in Kansas
City). Today, data is being generated at an unprecedented rate—not just
by companies but by everyone. Moreover, cloud-based systems for storing
data are increasingly cheap, readily available, and easy to use. The biggest
challenge today is turning the enormous amount of data we have into valuable
information.
T H E F I V E D O M A I N S O F D I G I TAL TRANSFORMATION5
Digital technologies are also transforming the ways that businesses
innovate. Traditionally, innovation was expensive, high stakes, and insular.
Testing new ideas was difficult and costly, so businesses relied on their
managers to guess what to build into a product before launching it in the
market. Today, digital technologies enable continuous testing and experimentation,
processes that were inconceivable in the past. Prototypes can be
built for pennies and ideas tested quickly with user communities. Constant
learning and the rapid iteration of products, before and after their launch
date, are becoming the norm.
Finally, digital technologies force us to think differently about how we
understand and create value for the customer. What customers value can
change very quickly, and our competitors are constantly uncovering new
opportunities that our customers may value. All too often, when a business
hits upon success in the marketplace, a dangerous complacency sets in. As
Andy Grove warned years ago, in the digital age, “only the paranoid survive.”
Constantly pushing the envelope to find our next source of customer
value is now an imperative.
Taken together, we can see how digital forces are reshaping five key
domains of strategy: customers, competition, data, innovation, and value
(see figure 1.1). These five domains describe the landscape of digital transformation
for business today. (For a simple mnemonic, you can remember
the five domains as CC-DIV, pronounced “see-see-div.”)
Across these five domains, digital technologies are redefining many
of the underlying principles of strategy and changing the rules by which

Figure 1.1
Five Domains of Digital Transformation.
6 T H E F I V E D O M A I N S O F D I G I TAL TRANSFORMATION
companies must operate in order to succeed. Many old constraints have
been lifted, and new possibilities are now available. Companies that were
established before the Internet need to realize that many of their fundamental
assumptions must now be updated. Table 1.1 sets out the changes in these
strategic assumptions as businesses move from the analog to the digital age.
Let’s dig a bit more deeply into how digital technologies are challenging
the strategic assumptions in each of these domains.
Customers
The first domain of digital transformation is customers. In traditional theory,
customers were seen as aggregate actors to be marketed to and persuaded
to buy. The prevailing model of mass markets focused on achieving
efficiencies of scale through mass production (make one product to serve
as many customers as possible) and mass communication (use a consistent
message and medium to reach and persuade as many customers as possible
at the same time).
In the digital age, we are moving to a world best described not by
mass markets but by customer networks. In this paradigm, customers are
dynamically connected and interacting in ways that are changing their relationships
to business and to each other. Customers today are constantly
connecting with and influencing each other and shaping business reputations
and brands. Their use of digital tools is changing how they discover,
evaluate, purchase, and use products and how they share, interact, and stay
connected with brands.
This is forcing businesses to rethink their traditional marketing funnel
and reexamine their customers’ path to purchase, which may skip from
using social networks, search engines, mobile screens, or laptops, to walking
into a store, to asking for customer service in a live online chat. Rather
than seeing customers only as targets for selling, businesses need to recognize
that a dynamic, networked customer may just be the best focus group,
brand champion, or innovation partner they will ever find.
Competition
The second domain of digital transformation is competition: how businesses
compete and cooperate with other firms. Traditionally, competition

and cooperation were seen as binary opposites: businesses competed with
rival businesses that looked very much like themselves, and they cooperated
with supply chain partners who distributed their goods or provided
needed inputs for their production.
Today, we are moving to a world of fluid industry boundaries,
one where our biggest challengers may be asymmetric competitors—
companies from outside our industry that look nothing like us but that
offer competing value to our customers. Digital “disintermediation” is
upending partnerships and supply chains—our longtime business partner
may become our biggest competitor if that partner starts serving our
customers directly.
At the same time, we may need to cooperate with a direct rival due
to interdependent business models or mutual challenges from outside our
industry. Most importantly, digital technologies are supercharging the
power of platform business models, which allow one business to create and
capture enormous value by facilitating the interactions between other businesses
or customers.
The net result of these changes is a major shift in the locus of competition.
Rather than a zero-sum battle between similar rivals, competition
is increasingly a jockeying for influence between firms with very different
business models, each seeking to gain more leverage in serving the ultimate
consumer.
Data
The next domain of digital transformation is data: how businesses produce,
manage, and utilize information. Traditionally, data was produced through
a variety of planned measurements (from customer surveys to inventories)
that were conducted within a business’s own processes—manufacturing,
operations, sales, marketing. The resulting data was used mainly for evaluating,
forecasting, and decision making.
By contrast, today we are faced with a data deluge. Most data available
to businesses is not generated through any systematic planning like
a market survey; instead, it is being generated in unprecedented quantities
from every conversation, interaction, or process inside or outside these
businesses. With social media, mobile devices, and sensors on every object
in a company’s supply chain, every business now has access to a river of
T H E F I V E D O M A I N S O F D I G I TAL TRANSFORMATION9
unstructured data that is generated without planning and that can increasingly
be utilized with new analytical tools.
These “big data” tools allow firms to make new kinds of predictions,
uncover unexpected patterns in business activity, and unlock new sources
of value. Rather than being confined to the province of specific business
intelligence units, data is becoming the lifeblood of every department and
a strategic asset to be developed and deployed over time. Data is a vital
part of how every business operates, differentiates itself in the market, and
generates new value.
Innovation
The fourth domain of digital transformation is innovation: the process
by which new ideas are developed, tested, and brought to the market by
businesses. Traditionally, innovation was managed with a singular focus
on the finished product. Because market testing was difficult and costly,
most decisions on new innovations were based on the analysis and intuition
of managers. The cost of failure was high, so avoiding failure was
paramount.
Today’s start-ups have shown us that digital technologies can enable a
very different approach to innovation, one based on continuous learning
through rapid experimentation. As digital technologies make it easier and
faster than ever to test ideas, we can gain market feedback from the very
beginning of our innovation process, all the way through to launch, and
even afterward.
This new approach to innovation is focused on careful experiments
and on minimum viable prototypes that maximize learning while minimizing
cost. Assumptions are repeatedly tested, and design decisions are
made based on validation by real customers. In this approach, products are
developed iteratively through a process that saves time, reduces the cost of
failures, and improves organizational learning.
Value
The final domain of digital transformation is the value a business delivers
to its customers—its value proposition. Traditionally, a firm’s value
10 T H E F I V E D O M A I N S O F D I G I TAL TRANSFORMATION
proposition was seen as fairly constant. Products may be updated,
marketing campaigns refreshed, or operations improved, but the basic
value a business offered to its customers was assumed to be constant
and defined by its industry (e.g., car companies offer transportation,
safety, comfort, and status, in varying degrees). A successful business
was one that had a clear value proposition, found a point of market
differentiation (e.g., price or branding), and focused on executing and
delivering the best version of the same value proposition to its customers
year after year.
In the digital age, relying on an unchanging value proposition is inviting
challenge and eventual disruption by new competitors. Although industries
will vary as to the exact timing and nature of their transformation by
new technologies, those who assume it will be a little farther down the road
are most likely to be run over. The only sure response to a shifting business
environment is to take a path of constant evolution, looking to every
technology as a way to extend and improve our value proposition to our
customers. Rather than waiting to adapt when change becomes a matter of
life or death, businesses need to focus on seizing emerging opportunities,
divesting from declining sources of advantage, and adapting early to stay
ahead of the curve of change.
A Playbook for Digital Transformation
Faced with transformation in each of these five domains, businesses today
clearly need new frameworks for formulating their own strategies to successfully
adapt and grow in the digital age.
Each of the domains has a core strategic theme that can provide you
with a point of departure for your digital strategy. Like the engineers
who trained the traditional factory managers, these five themes can
guide you, revealing how the constraints of your traditional strategy are
changing and how opportunities are opening up to build your business
in new ways. I call this set of strategic themes the digital transformation
playbook.
Figure 1.2 depicts this playbook on one page, along with many of the
key concepts we will explore in this book as we examine each theme in
detail. In doing so, it illustrates how the building blocks of your playbook
for digital transformation fit together. Let’s look at each of the five themes
to understand them a bit better.

Harness Customer Networks
As customers behave less like isolated individuals and more like tightly
connected networks, every business must learn to harness the power and
potential of those customer networks. That means learning to engage,
empower, and co-create with customers beyond the point of initial purchase.
It means leveraging the ways that happy customers influence others
and drive new business opportunities.
Harnessing customer networks may involve collaborating with customers
directly, like the fans of Doritos snack chips who create its awardwinning
advertisements or the drivers using Waze who provide the input
that powers its unique mapping system. It may involve learning to think
like a media company, like cosmetics giant L’Oréal or industrial glassmaker
Corning, both of whose content has been spread far and wide by networked
customers. Other organizations, like Life Church and Walmart, are connecting
with customers by finding the right moment in their digital lives
for the value each organization is offering. Long-established companies,
from Coca-Cola to Maersk Line, are sparking social media conversations

with internal and external customers in industries as diverse as soft drinks
and container shipping services.
Today, creating an effective customer strategy requires that you understand
such key concepts as customers as strategic assets, the reinvented
marketing funnel, the digital path to purchase, and the five core behaviors
of customer networks (accessing, engaging, customizing, connecting, and
collaborating).
Build Platforms, Not Just Products
To master competition in the digital age, businesses must learn to cope with
asymmetric challengers who are reshuffling the roles of competition and
cooperation in every industry. They must also understand the increasing
importance of strategies to build platforms, not just products.
Building effective platform business models may involve becoming a
trusted intermediary who brings together competing businesses, as Wink
brought together Philips, Honeywell, Lutron, and Schlage. It may require
opening up a proprietary product for other companies to build on, like
Nike did with its wearable fitness devices and Apple did with its iPhone. Or,
as in the case of Uber and Airbnb, it may mean building a business whose
value is created largely by its partners, with its platform acting as the critical
connection point. Sometimes it may mean combining the best elements of
both traditional and platform business models, as Best Buy and Amazon
have each done. Firms may have to establish new partnerships to leverage
platforms for distribution, as The New York Times Company has done
with Facebook. Other firms may have to learn to renegotiate their relationships
with channel partners they have long relied on, as HBO and Allstate
Insurance have done. Still other firms may have to learn when and where
to cooperate with their fiercest competitors, as Samsung does with Apple.
Developing a digital-age competitive strategy requires that you understand
these principles: platform business models, direct and indirect network
effects, co-opetition between firms, the dynamics of intermediation
and disintermediation, and competitive value trains.
Turn Data Into Assets
In an age when data is in constant surplus and often free, the imperative
for businesses is to learn to turn it into a truly strategic asset. That requires
T H E F I V E D O M A I N S O F D I G I TAL TRANSFORMATION13
both assembling the right data and applying it effectively to generate longterm
business value.
Building a strong data asset may begin with effectively collaborating
with data partners, as Caterpillar does with its sales distributors and The
Weather Company does with its most avid customers. A data asset may
yield value in the form of new market insights: the unstructured conversations
of car customers revealed the trajectory of Cadillac’s brand; social
media showed Gaylord Hotels what motivated customer recommendations.
Data can add value by helping to identify which customers require
the most attention, as it did for priority guests of Intercontinental Hotels
and for high-needs patients served by the Camden Coalition of Healthcare
Providers. In other cases, data can be used to help businesses personalize
their communications to customers, whether it is Kimberly-Clark talking
to the right family about the right product or British Airlines identifying its
most valued business class fliers even when they are riding in coach class
with their families. Sometimes the value of data can be found in identifying
contextual patterns, as when Opower shows utility customers their electricity
usage or when Naviance helps high school students understand their
odds for admission as they apply to different colleges.
To create good data strategy, you must begin with an understanding
of the four templates of data value creation, the new sources and analytic
capabilities of big data, the role of causality in data-driven decision making,
and the risks around data security and privacy.
Innovate by Rapid Experimentation
Because digital technologies make it so fast, easy, and inexpensive to test
ideas, firms today need to master the art of rapid experimentation. This
requires a radically different approach to innovation that is based on validating
new ideas through rapid and iterative learning.
Rapid experimentation can involve continuous A/B and multivariate
testing, like the tests Capital One uses to refine its marketing and the
ones Amazon and Google use to refine their online services. Other experiments
may use minimum viable prototypes to explore new products: Intuit
tested the concept for a mobile finance app with a manager holding reams
of paper and a dumb phone. Experiments should involve rigorous testing
of an innovation’s assumptions as Rent The Runway did before launching
its online fashion service and JCPenney failed to do before launching
its catastrophic store redesign. Once an idea has been validated through
14 T H E F I V E D O M A I N S O F D I G I TAL TRANSFORMATION
experiment, it requires careful piloting and rollout, as Starbucks has done
with its new store features and Settlement Music House did with its community
music programs. And any business that commits to rapid experimentation
must learn to encourage smart failures within its organization,
as Tata has done with its Dare to Try initiative.
Innovating in the digital age requires that you have a firm understanding
of both convergent experiments (with valid samples, test groups, and controls)
and divergent experiments (designed for open-ended inquiry). To bring the
results to market, you need to understand both minimum viable prototypes
and products and master the four paths to scaling up an innovation.
Adapt Your Value Proposition
To master value creation in the digital age, businesses must learn how to
continuously adapt their value proposition. That means they need to learn
to focus beyond their current business model and zero in on how they can
best deliver value to their customers as new technologies reshape opportunities
and needs.
Continuous reconfiguration of a business may involve discovering new
customers and applications for its current products, as when Mohawk Fine
Papers found new digital uses for its products and the publisher of The
Deseret News discovered new online audiences for its content beyond its
traditional local market. It may mean evolving a business’s offering while
its old business model is under severe threat: Encyclopædia Britannica,
Inc., has reenvisioned itself as an educational resource; The New York
Times Company has reimagined what it means to be a news source.
Adaptation may mean aggressively developing a new suite of products in
anticipation of rapid customer changes, as Facebook did during its pivot
to mobile platforms. Or it may mean experimenting with new ways to
engage a business’s customers while they are still loyal to it, as the Metropolitan
Museum of Art has done, building an array of digital touchpoints
to deepen the cultural experiences of patrons near and far.
To proactively adapt your value proposition, you need to understand
these elements: the different key concepts of market value, the three possible
paths out of a declining market position, and the essential steps to take
to effectively analyze your existing value proposition, identify its emerging
threats and opportunities, and synthesize an effective next step in its
evolution.

Getting Started on Your Own Digital Transformation
Where do you get started on digital transformation if you are an established
firm?
Many books on digital innovation and strategy focus heavily on startups.
But the challenges of launching a blank-slate, digital-first business are
quite different from those of adapting an established firm that already has
infrastructure, sales channels, employees, and an organizational culture to
contend with.
In my own experience—advising executives at centuries-old multinational
firms as well as today’s digital titans and brand-new seed-funded
start-ups—I have seen that these leaders face very different challenges. The
same strategic principles—of customers, competition, data, innovation,
and value—apply. But the path to implementing these principles is different,
depending on the point from which one starts. That is why this book
focuses primarily on enterprises that were established before the birth of
the Internet and looks at how they are successfully transforming themselves
to operate by the principles of the digital age.
The book includes case examples from dozens of companies to illustrate
how each of the strategies discussed plays out in a variety of industries
and contexts. We will examine a few relevant examples from digital titans
(like Amazon, Apple, and Google) and from digital rising stars (like Airbnb,
Uber, and Warby Parker). But mostly we will look at existing enterprises
founded before the Internet and learn how they are adapting. These companies
vary in size and come from a diverse range of industries: automotive
and apparel, beauty and books, education and entertainment, finance and
fashion, health care and hospitality, movies and manufacturing, and real
estate, retail, and religion, among others.
In addition to frameworks, analysis, and numerous cases, the book
includes a set of nine strategic planning tools:

􀁲􀀁 Value Proposition Roadmap (chapter 6)
􀁲􀀁 Disruptive Business Model Map (chapter 7)
􀁲􀀁 Disruptive Response Planner (chapter 7)
These tools can be categorized as follows:
􀁲􀀁 Strategic ideation tools: Tools for generating a new solution to a defined
challenge by exploring different facets of a strategic phenomenon (Customer
Network Strategy Generator, Data Value Generator)
􀁲􀀁 Strategy maps: Visual tools that can be used to analyze an existing business
model or strategy or to assess and explore a new one (Platform
Business Model Map, Competitive Value Train, Disruptive Business

􀁲􀀁 Strategic decision tools: Tools with criteria for evaluating and deciding
among a set of generic options available for a key strategic decision
(Disruptive Response Planner)
􀁲􀀁 Strategic planning tools: Step-by-step planning processes or methods
that can be used to develop a strategic plan tailored to a specific business
context or challenge (Convergent Experimental Method, Divergent
Experimental Method, Value Proposition Roadmap)
These tools have been developed based on feedback from strategy
workshops that I have conducted with hundreds of companies around the
world. They are practical tools meant to help you directly apply the concepts
in this book to your own work, whatever your industry or business.
Each tool is presented briefly in the text of the book, tied to analysis
and cases that show how and where it may be useful. A more detailed
explanation of some tools, with step-by-step guidance for applying them
to your business, can be found in the Tools section of my website at http://
www.davidrogers.biz.
Of course, you will need to do more than just adopt the right strategic
thinking, planning frameworks, and tools for action. Pursuing digital
transformation in an established company will also force you to grapple
with important issues of organizational change.
Throughout the book, I have ended each chapter with a section that
discusses these organizational issues and hurdles. That’s because digital
transformation is not just about having the right strategy; it’s also
about making that strategy happen. My discussion involves questions of
T H E F I V E D O M A I N S O F D I G I TAL TRANSFORMATION17
leadership; company culture; changes to internal structures, processes, or
skills; and changes to external relationships. I draw on the perspectives of
specific business leaders who have grappled with these issues. The right
approach for you depends on the history and character of your organization.
My aim is mostly to shed light on some of the trickier hurdles that
may impede change because experience shows that digital transformation
doesn’t simply proceed on its own momentum, even if the company has
decided on the right strategy.
A Guide to the Rest of This Book
The next five chapters in the book are designed to focus your team on how
digital technologies are changing the traditional rules in each of the strategy
domains that I’ve introduced here. The chapters also show your team
what to do about these changes. You will learn how to apply each of the
core strategic themes and see examples of all kinds of businesses that are
using them to rethink their orientation in the digital age. As we saw with
Encyclopædia Britannica and will see in many other cases, the future is not
about new start-ups burying long-established enterprises. It’s about new
growth strategies and business models replacing old ones as established
companies learn new ways of operating.
However, even if you embrace all these strategies and tools, there
are no crystal balls in business. You could still find your business model
under sudden threat due to an unforeseen and unexpected new challenger:
disruption!
The last chapter of the book examines disruption—an oft-discussed
but not always well understood phenomenon—and how it unfolds in the
digital age. The chapter provides a tool to gauge whether or not an emerging
challenger really is a disruptive threat to your business. It also includes
a tool to assess your options if you are faced with a truly disruptive challenger:
Is it best to fight back or get out of the way? Mastering disruption
requires some rethinking and updating of Clayton Christensen’s classic
theory on this subject. Accordingly, we will examine a revised theory that
reflects some key changes to disruption in the digital age. And we will see
how disruption is rooted in the five domains of digital transformation that
we will examine throughout the book.
The book’s conclusion reflects on the remaining hurdles organizations
must clear to truly adopt the new strategic thinking at the heart of the
18 T H E F I V E D O M A I N S O F D I G I TAL TRANSFORMATION
digital transformation playbook. Sadly, not every business follows Britannica’s
example. For every Britannica, there is a Kodak or a Blockbuster—a
business that failed to recognize that the rules of the game had changed and
that did not manage to change its strategy to match digital reality. Here we
will examine why and how some institutions have failed to keep up. Finally,
the book provides a self-assessment tool with questions to help you judge
the readiness of your own business for digital transformation.

We live in what is commonly referred to as a digital age. An overlapping
ecosystem of digital technologies—each one building on those before and
catalyzing those to come—is transforming not only our personal and communal
lives but also the dynamics of business for organizations of every
size in every industry.
Digital technologies are transforming not just one aspect of business
management but virtually every aspect. They are rewriting the rules of
customers, competition, data, innovation, and value. Responding to these
changes requires more than a piecemeal approach; it calls for a total integrated
effort—a process of holistic digital transformation within the firm.
Fortunately, this process is clearly achievable. We are surrounded now by
examples of businesses whose own lessons, learned as they adapted to their
own very particular challenges, shed light on the universal principles that
apply to businesses in general. By mastering these lessons—and by learning
to apply this digital transformation playbook—any business can adapt and
grow in the digital age.
When he joined Life Church in Oklahoma as a pastor, Bobby Gruenewald
was only two years out of college, but he had already built and sold two
Web-based businesses, including an online community for fans of professional
wrestling. At Life Church, he focused on a community of a different
kind. He was brought on as Innovation Leader to help the three-year-old
evangelical church find new ways to reach a contemporary audience and
engage them in Christianity.
Many churches today use podcasts or streaming broadcasts of their
weekly sermons to reach parishioners on their commute, at home, or wherever
they can listen. Life Church has gone much further, building a “digital
mission” that includes on-demand and live-streaming video services
at LifeChurch.tv and a platform of technology tools for other churches to
use as well. During the heyday of the Second Life online community, Gruenewald
built a virtual church to reach believers in their 3D avatar forms.
He has bought Google ads to reach people searching for pornography and
steer them to a church experience instead. As he tweeted, “We’ll do anything
short of sin 2reach ppl who don’t know Christ. 2reach ppl no one is
reaching we’ll do things no one is doing.”1

Gruenewald’s biggest impact, though, may be in creating YouVersion,
the world’s most popular Bible app for smartphones. With more than
168 million downloads, the app rivals some of the biggest mobile games
and social networks. YouVersion allows users to read the Bible in over
700 languages, from Eastern Arctic Inukitut to Hawaiian English Creole;
it is the only mobile app in the world that includes such obscure languages
as Bolivian Guarani. Within a given language, there are numerous translations,
including 30 versions in English—from the King James Bible, to the
New International, to the ultramodern “The Message.” Readers can pick
and choose a translation, search for any passage or phrase, and highlight,
bookmark, and share what they are reading with others. Readers share
more than a hundred thousand verses a day, directly from the app. User
Jen Sears, a human resources manager in Oklahoma City, says that when
she wants to pray, she now reaches for her mobile phone. Since she installed
YouVersion, she says, “I have my print Bible sitting on my dresser at home,
but it hasn’t moved.”2
Every Sunday, screens are aglow in the hands of parishioners at
nearly 2,000 churches that use YouVersion to conduct their services. As
ministers preach, LifeChurch.tv’s servers track 600,000 requests per minute
and register which verses are most popular in different communities.
That helps Life Church choose the daily Bible verse that is sent out
to all 168 million users of the app. Other preachers, from megachurch
founder Rick Warren to Reverend Billy Graham, use YouVersion to distribute
their own custom reading plans to followers anywhere around the
world. Geoff Dennis, one of the publishers whose translation appears on
YouVersion, says, “They have defined what it means to access God’s word
on a mobile device.”3
Rethinking Customers
On-demand, customizable, connected, shareable—the same qualities that
LifeChurch.tv offers to engage its digital-age parishioners are what customers
seek from every business today.
As we begin to build our playbook for digital transformation, the first
domain of strategy that we need to rethink is customers. Customers have
always been essential to every business as the buyers of goods and services.
In order to grow, companies have targeted them with mass-marketing tools
designed to reach, inform, motivate, and persuade them to buy. But in the
HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS21
digital age, the relationship of customers to businesses is changing dramatically
(see table 2.1).
Another industry where this changed relationship is crystal clear is the
music business. Not long ago, the only role of the customer was to buy a
copy of the latest product (a CD or an LP). To sell their products, record
labels relied on a few mass channels for promotion (radio airplay, MTV)
and distribution (chain record stores, Walmart). Today, customers expect
to listen to any song at any time, streaming from a variety of services on
a variety of devices. They discover music through search engines, social
media, and the recommendations of both friends and algorithms. Musicians
may skip the record label and go directly to the customers themselves.
They ask customers to help fundraise for an album before it is even
recorded, to share it on their playlists, and to connect their favorite bands
to peers in their social networks.
Customers in the digital age are not passive consumers but nodes
within dynamic networks—interacting and shaping brands, markets, and
each other. Businesses need to recognize this new reality and treat customers
accordingly. They need to understand how customer networks are
redefining the marketing funnel, reshaping customers’ path to purchase,
and opening up new ways to co-create value with customers. Businesses
need to understand the five core behaviors—access, engage, customize,
connect, and collaborate—that drive customers in their digital experiences
and interactions. And they need to leverage these behaviors to invent new
communications, products, or experiences that add value to both sides of
the business-customer relationship.
This chapter explores how and why the relationship to customers is
changing in every industry and what the challenges are for enterprises that

developed in the mass-media era. It presents a framework for understanding
customers’ networked behaviors and motivations. And it introduces
the Customer Network Strategy Generator, an ideation tool for developing
breakthrough strategies to engage your networked customers and achieve
specific business objectives.
Let’s start by looking more closely at how and why the relationship of
customers to businesses is changing so fundamentally.
The Customer Network Paradigm
Today, customers’ behavior—how they find, access, use, share, and influence
the products, services, and brands in their lives—is radically different
than in the era in which modern business practices arose.
In the twentieth century, businesses of all kinds were built on a massmarket
model (see figure 2.1). In this paradigm, customers are passive and
are considered in aggregate. Their only significant role is to either purchase
or not purchase, and companies seek to identify the product or service that
will suit the needs of as many potential customers as possible. Mass media
and mass production are used to deliver and promote a company’s offerings
to as many customers as possible. Success in the mass-market model
hinges on efficiencies of scale. And for decades, it worked! Throughout the
twentieth century, this approach built the world’s largest and most successful
companies.
Today, however, we are in the midst of a profound shift toward a new
paradigm that I call the customer network model (see figure 2.2).4 In this
model, the firm is still a central actor in the creation and promotion of
goods and services. But the new roles of customers create a more complex
Figure 2.1
Mass-Market Model.

relationship. No longer are they relegated to a binary role of “buy” or “do
not buy.” In the customer network model, current and potential customers
have access to a wide variety of digital platforms that allow them to
interact, publish, broadcast, and innovate—and thereby shape brands,
reputations, and markets. Customers are just as likely to connect with and
influence each other as they are to be influenced by the direct communications
from a firm. Borrowing from the rich theories of network science
(which date back to eighteenth-century mathematics and have been
applied to model the spread of language and disease and the structures of
railroads and nervous systems), we can see customers as nodes in a network,
linked together digitally by various tools and platforms and interacting
dynamically.
In a market defined by customer networks, the roles of companies are
dramatically different as well. Yes, the firm is still the greatest single engine
for innovation of products and services, and still the steward of its brand
and reputation. But while delivering value outward to customers and communicating
to them, the firm also needs to engage with its customer network.
It needs to listen in, observe the customers’ networked interactions,
and understand their perceptions, responses, and unmet needs. It needs to
identify and nurture those customers who may become brand champions,
evangelists, marketing partners, or cocreators of value with the firm.

Customer Network Model.
24 HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS
One of the main points in the model of customer networks is that a
“customer” can be any key constituency that the organization serves and
relies on. Customers may be end consumers purchasing a product or
businesses purchasing professional services. For a nonprofit, they may be
donors or grassroots volunteers. In many cases, it is important to look at a
range of interconnected constituencies that are all within an organization’s
customer network: end consumers, business partners, investors, press, government
regulators, even employees. All of these types of customers are
critical to the business of a firm, and all of them now exhibit dynamic,
networked behaviors in relating to the firm and to each other.
A Different Take on Brands
The broad shift in the balance of power between companies and networked customers
is redefining brand relationships. A brand is no longer something that a
business alone creates, defines, and projects outward; it is something that customers
shape, too, and the business needs their help to fully create it. Many customers
want to do more than just buy products and brands; they want to co-create them.
PepsiCo is one of many brand-focused traditional enterprises that has
rethought the role of its customers in its brands. Brand communications used
to come solely from the business, but now some of its best communications are
created by the customers themselves. By eschewing professional ad agencies and
inviting customers to compete to make the funniest thirty-second ads themselves,
PepsiCo’s Doritos brand has consistently won awards for the most liked,
talked about, and effective ads during the Super Bowl. PepsiCo’s Lay’s brand of
potato chips has even let customers help reinvent the product. Millions of them
have nominated or voted on new potato chip flavors as part of the brand’s Do Us
A Flavor social media contests.
Brands taking this approach are responding to a broad shift in customer
expectations. A global study of 15,000 consumers by Edelman, in 2014, found
that most customers want more than a “transactional” relationship; they expect
brands to “take a stand” on issues and invite consumer participation. When they
see a brand reaching out to them, they are more willing to advocate for that
brand, defend it from criticism, share personal information, and purchase from
the brand.5
Clearly, a strong brand today is much more than a business’s crisp logo and
a powerful positioning statement; it is a shared creation, bolstered by customer
networks.

The Marketing Funnel and the Path to Purchase
The marketing funnel (sometimes called the purchase funnel) is one framework
for understanding how customer networks have such great impact on
businesses’ relationships to customers. This classic strategic model is based
on “hierarchy of effects” psychological research dating to the 1920s.6 It
maps out the progression of a potential customer from awareness (knowledge
that a product or company exists) to consideration (recognition of
potential value) to preference (intent to purchase or choice of a preferred
company) to action (purchase of a product, subscription to a service, voting
for a political candidate, etc.). At each stage, the number of potential
customers inevitably diminishes (more will be aware than consider, etc.)—
hence the tapering shape of the funnel. In recent years, a further stage,
loyalty, was added. It is almost always more efficient to invest in retaining
customers than in attempting to acquire new ones.
The enduring utility of the marketing funnel stems from the fact that
it is a psychological model, based on a progression of psychological states
(awareness, etc.). As a result, the funnel can still be applied even as customer
behaviors change dramatically—for example, due to the rise of customer
networks.
In the mass-market era, businesses developed an array of “broadcast”
marketing tools to reach and influence customers at different stages of the
funnel (see figure 2.3). Television advertising, for example, is extremely
effective at driving awareness, with some impact at later stages. Direct mail
coupons and promotions help drive customers from choice of a brand
(preference) to sale (action). Reward programs—offering incentives for
everything from collecting a product’s box tops to having a card punched
at a local diner—help nudge customers from initial sale (action) to repeat
business (loyalty).
Today, all of these broadcast tools are still in play, and each can be quite
useful in a given instance. If a business needs to rapidly boost awareness of
a new product across a very broad mass audience, television advertising is
still the most powerful tool (although expensive). Out-of-home billboards,
direct mail, newspaper advertising—all of these still have a potential role
for reaching customers. But depending on whom you are trying to reach,
you may find these broadcast tools becoming less effective over time (especially
given the changing media habits of younger consumers) and therefore
less cost effective. (The price per thousand viewers of a U.S. television
26 HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS
ad continues to rise each year, despite the increasing fragmentation of that
audience outside of a few huge live events like the Super Bowl.)
At the same time, however, at each stage of the marketing funnel,
today’s customers are also influenced by customer networks (also shown in
figure 2.3). Search engine results are now one of the biggest drivers of customer
awareness for any new brand or business. Customer reviews, posted
on sites such as Amazon or TripAdvisor, are hugely influential in the consideration
stage as consumers evaluate different brands. These third-party
reviews are influential even when customers are purchasing offline, in a
physical store. With the Internet at their fingertips via smartphones, customers
are engaging in online research for products that were once “impulse”
buys—purchases driven solely by shelf placement and packaging. As customers
progress to brand preference, they often turn to social networks like
Facebook, asking if any friends have visited this vacation destination or purchased
that brand of refrigerator. At the action stage, they may purchase
from a retail business on its website, in its store, on a mobile device, or even
on a mobile device while standing in its store. After purchase, companies
now have many more ways—from e-mail marketing to social media—to
maintain a relationship with these customers and drive them to loyalty.

Rethinking the Marketing Funnel.
HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS27
Today’s customer networks, however, make their biggest impact on the
marketing funnel through an additional level, which I call advocacy. At
this psychological stage, customers are not just loyal; they advocate for the
brand and connect the brand to people in their network. These customers
post photos of products on Instagram, write reviews on TripAdvisor,
and answer friends’ product questions on Twitter. Thanks to search engine
algorithms, this type of customer expression is heavily weighted to influence
search results. Each customer’s advocacy thus feeds back up to the top
of the funnel and has the potential to increase the magnitude of awareness,
consideration, and so on through the funnel. (This extended, or looped,
marketing funnel is sometimes renamed the customer journey, with new
names invented for the same stages of the funnel, ending in advocacy. But
the model is the same.)
Now every business needs to go beyond driving potential customers
to the stages of purchase (action) and repeat purchase (loyalty). Businesses
need also to engage, nurture, and inspire repeat customers to enter the
stage of advocacy, where they will contribute to the growth of the business
in the rest of its customer network.
At the same time that the funnel is influenced by customers’ networked
behaviors, their range of possible touchpoints with a company
is increasing dramatically. In addition to advertisements, store shelves,
and possibly a call center, today’s customers may be consulting a search
engine, the company’s website, a mobile app, a local map search, a physical
retailer, online retailers, peers on social media, the company’s own
social media accounts, instant chat, and customer review sites. Customers
are increasingly proactive in taking advantage of all these resources.
Customers who are standing in a store looking at a product display are
likely to use a mobile device to check prices, additional product details,
and customer reviews. They may also check shipping options if they don’t
want to carry the product home. And they may be instant messaging a
quick snapshot to their friend or spouse before making a final decision on
color or model. In a study at Columbia Business School on “Showrooming
and the Rise of the Mobile-Assisted Shopper,” we observed all these
behaviors and more.7
These touchpoints open multiple paths to a purchase. To effectively
market to customers, businesses must think about the specific needs that
will lead customers to take one path to purchase versus another: How
quickly do they need the product? How price sensitive are they? Do they
28 HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS
already have a preferred brand? How close are they to physical retailers?
And so on. Businesses can increase their influence by mapping and optimizing
the customer experience on each path. They begin this process by
developing an “omni-channel” view of the customer—based on an understanding
that the same customer may be using a tablet app and a desktop
computer and walking into a store. Designing each touchpoint experience
What Is a Customer Worth?
One of the most important questions any business must face today is, How much
are my customers worth?
As customer interactions expand across more digital touchpoints, measuring the
return of marketing investments requires new financial tools. Chief among them is
a model of customer lifetime value—the profitability of each customer for your bottom
line over the long term. For any business, some customers are more profitable
than others, and some may even be costing you money. Customer lifetime value
can be shaped by various factors: frequency of purchase, volume of purchase, price
point, reliance on discounting, and loyalty or attrition rate. To build a model, you
will need historical data and the involvement of your finance team. (To get started,
you can read Managing Customers as Investments by Sunil Gupta and Don Lehmann.
8) Once you have a customer lifetime value model, it is extremely helpful in
segmenting your customers, defining objectives for new customer strategies, and
measuring the impact of things like customer engagement and advocacy.
In a networked world, though, customers add value in more ways than just
their transactions over time. Increasingly, new business models are being built
where the customers’ participation, data, and collective knowledge are a business
asset and a key competitive advantage.
This more intangible value of customer networks can even be a factor in the
financial valuation of firms. Customer participation is a key driver of stock price
for social networks such as Facebook or LinkedIn. When Yahoo paid $1 billion for
the popular blogging platform Tumblr, it was not for Tumblr’s paltry revenue but
for its large network of young, active, creative users. Of course, the challenge in
acquiring a firm for its customer network is that continued customer loyalty is not
assured. When Google purchased Waze for $1.1 billion, it was critical to maintain
the participation of Waze’s customer network to justify the full price of the acquisition.
Google immediately announced that Waze would not be rolled into Google
Maps but would be kept as a separate product run by the original Israeli team that
started it. Customer networks are extremely valuable, but they are intangible assets
that can’t be swapped and leveraged as easily as real estate or factory equipment.
HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS29
in isolation, as if it were for a different customer, dilutes and disrupts the
brand experience. An omni-channel experience uses design to integrate the
path to purchase as it moves from one touchpoint to the next.
Whereas the funnel is a macro tool for thinking very broadly about
customers’ psychological states, the path to purchase is a lens for looking at
customer behaviors much more specifically. Both perspectives illustrate the
necessity of understanding customer motivations and needs more deeply
than ever. They also point to two striking new imperatives for every business:
create compelling experiences at each step of the path to purchase,
and drive customer advocacy at the end of the funnel so as to engage and
co-create value with the most involved customers. These imperatives raise
important questions: How do you engage customers in their networked
world? What motivates them? What are they looking for?
Five Customer Network Behaviors
In the research for my book The Network Is Your Customer, I sought to answer
this question: What kinds of digital offerings most deeply engage customers
in their digital lives? I started by looking at hundreds of cases—across consumer
and B2B industries—of the products, services, communications, and
experiences that had been embraced and adopted by customers during the
first two decades of the World Wide Web and the mobile Internet. What I
found was a recurring pattern of five behaviors that drive the adoption of
new digital experiences. I call these the five core behaviors of networked
customers:
􀁲􀀁 Access: They seek to access digital data, content, and interactions as
quickly, easily, and flexibly as possible. Any offering that enhances
this access is incredibly compelling. Think of text messaging on early
mobile phones, which revolutionized communications with the ability
to receive and send messages from anywhere at any time. From the
convenience of e-commerce to today’s latest instant messaging apps,
customers are drawn to anything that provides the immediacy of simple,
instant access.
􀁲􀀁 Engage: They seek to engage with digital content that is sensory,
interactive, and relevant to their needs. From the early popularity of
Web portals, to the spread of online video, to next-generation virtual
realities—their digital desires are marked by a thirst for content. The
old media adage that “content is king” is at least half right. Although
30 HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS
content makers may struggle to earn profits in the digital era, there is
no question that the desire to engage with content is a key driver of
customer behavior.
􀁲􀀁 Customize: They seek to customize their experiences by choosing and
modifying a wide assortment of information, products, and services.
In a generation, customers have gone from having a handful of television
channel options to a digital world with more than a trillion webpages.
They have been trained by their digital networks to expect ever
more options for personal choice, and they like this. From Pandora’s
personalized radio streams to Google’s search bar that anticipates their
search terms when they type just a few characters, they are drawn to
increasingly customized experiences.
􀁲􀀁 Connect: They seek to connect with one another by sharing their experiences,
ideas, and opinions through text, images, and social links.
This behavior has driven the entire explosion of social media—from
blogging, to social networks like Facebook or LinkedIn, to online
niche communities that gather around a shared passion, vocation, or
viewpoint. All of these incredibly popular platforms are driven by the
behavior of individuals using small bits of text and images to signal to
others that “here is where I am, what I’m thinking, what I see.”
􀁲􀀁 Collaborate: As social animals, they are naturally drawn to work
together. Accordingly, they seek to collaborate on projects and goals
through open platforms. This is the most complex and difficult of these
five behaviors, but it doesn’t stop them from trying. Whether building
open-source software together, raising money for causes they believe
in, or organizing write-ins and protests around the world, they seek
collaboration.
As illustrated in figure 2.4, these customer behaviors can be leveraged
strategically through a set of corresponding customer network strategies.
These can be used for strategic planning for any industry, business model,
or customer objective. I have used them in executive strategy workshops
with hundreds of companies facing widely varying customer challenges. By
starting with a strategy rooted in customer behavior, businesses can avoid
the trap of technology-first thinking (What’s our Twitter video strategy?)
and focus instead on value to the customer and the business.
Let’s take a look at each of the five strategies in depth, with examples.
Then I will present a tool that you can use to choose which customer network
strategy is best for a given business scenario.
HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS31
Access Strategy
The access strategy for business is to be faster, be easier, be everywhere, and
be always on for your customers. We know that standards of speed, ease,
and ubiquity may shift over time: where an access strategy might have once
meant offering e-commerce for the first time, today it might mean providing
a mobile-optimized website, more rapid delivery, or order tracking. My
research on mobile showrooming with Matt Quint and Rick Ferguson found
that the same customers may, at different times, choose to buy a product
online or in a store (even choosing the more expensive option), depending
on which method gives them greater convenience. And that convenience
depends on context: Am I buying something I want to use right now? Is it
something heavy that is easier to have shipped to my home? Can I afford to
wait a day or two for delivery?9 The use of cloud computing, mobile devices,
and location-based geo-targeting has brought a wave of new innovations
that grant greater access to consumers and business customers alike.

An access strategy may therefore take a variety of approaches, including
mobile commerce, omni-channel experiences, working in the cloud, and
on-demand service.
􀁲􀀁 Mobile commerce: Travelers are already accustomed to using QR codes
on their phone screens as tickets to board planes and trains. Hotel
chains like Starwood are developing room doors that guests can unlock
with a swipe of their smartphone. Tesco launched its stores in South
Korea by putting up posters of popular grocery items on subway platforms
and allowing customers to order home delivery right from their
phone just by scanning the item they wanted (milk, biscuits, 32 oz.
Snapple). With mobile payment systems and in-store targeting, customers
can receive discounts, redeem coupons, purchase, and recommend,
all from their small screen.
􀁲􀀁 Omni-channel experiences: Increasingly, businesses are recognizing
that customers are looking for an integrated experience across all digital
and physical touchpoints. Walmart, for example, has developed a
mobile shopping app with different features designed for when customers
are in a Walmart store versus using the same app at home. An
additional feature auto-detects when a customer opens the app while
in one of its four thousand North American stores, to provide the right
version. After implementing this enhanced mobile app, Walmart found
that 12 percent of its online sales came from customers who purchased
from Walmart.com while in the store aisle.
􀁲􀀁 Working in the cloud: With the shift from downloaded MP3s on iTunes
to streaming music services like Spotify, consumers are quickly becoming
accustomed to paying for products that reside entirely in the cloud.
Likewise, businesses are shifting more and more of their work processes
to the cloud with software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers like
Google Apps, Salesforce, Dropbox, and Evernote. The result is much
lower IT costs for businesses and greater flexibility for an increasingly
mobile and collaborative workforce.
􀁲􀀁 On-demand services: Increasingly, services that used to require the customer
to be in a specific location at a specific time are now accessible
to customers anywhere at any time. Retail banks that used to advertise
the number of local ATMs they had are now touting all the banking
services customers can manage via their phone (including scanning a
paper check to deposit it). Start-ups like the Khan Academy, Coursera,
and EdX are pushing the limits of on-demand education. Health care
is just beginning to take advantage of telemedicine, where customers
HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS33
receive nonurgent care and consultation remotely by text, e-mail, and
live videoconferencing with a physician.
The keys to an access strategy are simplicity, convenience, ubiquity, and
flexibility. Offering a product or service one step closer, easier, or faster
helps your business to continuously create additional value for customers
and win their loyalty.
Engage Strategy
The engage strategy for business is to become a source of valued content
for your customers. Businesses today face an increasingly challenging environment
in seeking to communicate with their customers. The profusion
of media channels and forms (from YouTube, to gaming consoles, to news
via mobile apps) has fragmented the audience for traditional media, where
brands historically placed advertising. In this context, businesses must
expand their approach beyond interruption advertisements—messages
that customers see only because they piggyback on or interrupt content
that customers are genuinely interested in. Businesses need to adopt a different
mindset and learn to create their own content that is relevant enough
for customers to seek it out, consume it, and even share it within their
networks. At the same time, this content must add value to businesses by
enhancing their customer relationships.
An engage strategy may take a variety approaches, including product
demos, storytelling, utility, and brands as publishers.
􀁲􀀁 Product demos: Content that demonstrates the value proposition
of a business or product in a compelling and engaging way can be
extremely effective. When L’Oréal was looking to raise the profile of a
niche brand, the tattoo cover-up Dermablend, the company produced
a long-form music video featuring Rick Genest (aka “Zombie Boy”), a
Canadian artist and model whose entire body is covered in tattoos. The
video starts with an apparently untattooed Genest, but as the Dermablend
covering his skin is gradually removed, viewers witness a startling
transformation. The video was placed on YouTube with virtually
no media budget to promote it and became a sensation, with over 25
million views. Like the famous “Will it blend?” videos that popularized
premium blender brand Blendtec, the Zombie Boy video is effective
because the drama is entirely about the product’s performance.
34 HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS
􀁲􀀁 Storytelling: In other cases, brands can reach a broader audience by
creating an emotionally compelling story that is less product-specific.
Industrial glass manufacturer Corning used a six-minute video called
“A Day Made of Glass” to depict its vision of a future full of interactive
glass surfaces, touchscreens, and display technologies. The video was
viewed more than 20 million times, and Corning launched a follow-up
series of videos and content around its technologies.
􀁲􀀁 Utility: Content isn’t always about stories and emotions, however. It
can also be about utility. Brands can effectively engage customers by
providing useful content at just the right time. Columbia Sportswear
connects to consumers interested in an active, outdoor life by creating
mobile apps that range from a handy guide to tying rope knots
(with examples from sailors, fishermen, and mountaineers) to a GPS
Portable Activity Log (designed to help customers rapidly journal their
most memorable outdoor experiences using a mix of videos, geo-tags,
notes, photos, and records of distance traveled, time, and elevation).
􀁲􀀁 Brands as publishers: In some cases, brands move beyond individual
pieces of content and engage customers by becoming publishers in
their own right. Luxury department store Barneys New York has a website
for e-commerce, but it has also become publisher of The Window,
an online magazine that tells the stories of designers, fashion models,
and craftspeople and of the products themselves—offering the kind of
interviews and style guides you’d expect in a fashion magazine, not a
product catalog. The company evaluates its return on investment (ROI)
for The Window by comparing the purchasing patterns of customers
who spend time on it to those of its general customer population.
The key to an engage strategy is to think like a media company, focused
every day on earning the attention of your audience. First, know your customers
and create content that is relevant, compelling, or useful to them;
then strategize about how to use this engagement to strengthen your customer
relationship. Meanwhile, measure the impact on your business.
Customize Strategy
The customize strategy for business is to make your offering adaptable
to your customers’ needs. Customization is increasingly possible due
to the spread of e-commerce; automation in inventory and shipping;
HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS35
digitization of media products; advances in 2D and 3D printing technologies;
and the accessibility of big data on consumers’ preferences, location,
and behaviors. As customers seek more choice and more personalized
experiences, businesses need to find ways to meet their demands without
overwhelming them with choice or unnerving them with excessively
personal messaging.
A customize strategy may take a variety of approaches, including recommendation
engines as well as personalized interfaces, products and services,
and messages and content.
􀁲􀀁 Recommendation engines: To help viewers find what to watch from its
large catalog of streaming television and movie titles, Netflix uses a
combination of behavioral data (What kinds of shows has this user
watched on prior Wednesday nights at 10:00 p.m.?) and a system of
micro-tags that human staff apply to all of its content. The result is
a constantly changing, personalized set of playlists served up every
time the user logs in. The micro-genres (more than 76,000 by one estimate)
range from “Mother-Son Movies from the 1970s” to “Cerebral
Suspenseful Dramas Starring Raymond Burr.”10 The impact of these
recommendations can be measured by how infrequently customers
bother to use the search bar to find a show to watch. Their success is
striking: 75 percent of customers’ viewing hours are spurred by Netflix’s
personalized recommendations.11
􀁲􀀁 Personalized interfaces: Lancôme’s magic mirror on its Facebook page
allows customers to select one of their Facebook photos and then try
out various beauty products, virtually applying them to the photos to
see how they look on the customers’ own features, complexion, and
hair. Increasingly, customers are expecting more personalized interfaces,
whether online, in retail spaces, or moving between them.
􀁲􀀁 Personalized products and services: Coke sales were declining among
young adults in Australia when Coca-Cola introduced its personalized
Share a Coke cans there. The company chose the 150 most popular
names for young adults in Australia and printed those names on the
cans in place of the brand’s own name—but in the same recognizable
script. Customers with less common names could print personalized
cans of Coke at kiosks in major shopping centers or share a personalized
virtual can on Facebook. The customized cans were so popular
that young adult consumption grew 7 percent in the Australian market,
and Coca-Cola extended the campaign to eighty countries worldwide.12
36 HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS
With 3D printing being applied to prosthetic limbs, automobile chassis,
and running shoes, the opportunities for customized products are rapidly
expanding.
􀁲􀀁 Personalized messages and content: One of the easiest ways to customize
an offering for customers is through media and messaging. As publishers
transition from print to digital, they are able to deliver only the
most appropriate content for each customer. They can invite readers
to indicate their interests (thumbs up or down), directly observe what
customers spend time on, and then promote future articles likely to
be of highest relevance. Customized messages improve marketing as
well. Microsoft increased the conversion rates of one e-mail marketing
campaign by 70 percent by targeting the specific offer based on the
recipient’s location, age, gender, and online activity.13
The keys to a customize strategy are identifying the areas where your
customers’ needs and behaviors diverge and finding the right tools to either
personalize on their behalf or empower them to personalize their own
experiences.
Connect Strategy
The connect strategy for business is to become a part of your customers’ conversations.
With Facebook, which has surpassed 1.5 billion active users, and
other huge platforms like Sina Weibo, Twitter, and LinkedIn, social media
have become a global standard for how customers communicate with each
other. They are also increasingly where customers expect to communicate
with businesses of all kinds. Whether answering customers’ questions, solving
their problems, or providing product news, businesses are expected to
be present, responsive, and active in social media conversations.
A connect strategy may take a variety approaches, including social listening,
social customer service, joining the conversation, asking for ideas
and content, and hosting a community.
􀁲􀀁 Social listening: Customer conversations can be a tremendous source
of market insight for businesses, which can listen and learn with the
help of numerous tools. Insights can range from product problems to
drivers of positive customer comments. Many brands have used social
insights to inform new branding and ad campaigns. Cable provider
HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS37
Comcast has used social listening to identify regional outages even
before its engineering teams do.
􀁲􀀁 Social customer service: Many businesses find that social media can
serve as an effective channel within their customer service mix, alongside
call centers, instant chat, and other tools. If a business is able to
answer questions successfully, it can impress not only one customer
but a network of others as well (a customer who experiences a problem
but has it resolved well is the most likely to evangelize on behalf of the
company). Of course, not all issues can be resolved in a social media
exchange, but effective training can make a big difference. After building
up its social media leadership team, Citibank was able to resolve
36 percent of its customers’ Twitter queries within that social media
channel versus only 11 percent for Wells Fargo and 3 percent for Bank
of America.14
􀁲􀀁 Joining the conversation: Maersk Line, a container shipping company
with 25,000 employees, decided to test whether social media could
help its corporate communications. As an experiment, the company
began engaging in conversations and sharing videos and photos from
its ships around the world, using platforms as diverse as Facebook, Instagram,
LinkedIn, YouTube, Sina Weibo, and Pinterest. Within a year,
the project had helped defuse a PR crisis involving a dead narwhale,
uncover historical video from the company’s archives, and build a large
and engaged following of customers, suppliers, shipping experts, and
employees. Among the most tangible benefits for Maersk were new
networks for hiring and recruiting, new sales leads, and improved satisfaction
among both customers and employees.15
􀁲􀀁 Asking for ideas and content: Many times, companies will connect with
customers by using social media to ask them for ideas, suggestions, or
content in the form of photos or videos. Action camera brand GoPro
built its reputation entirely by asking customers to share their most
amazing videos filmed with the product, whether surfing, hang gliding,
or bike riding. Other companies, from Dell to Starbucks, have used
tools like the IdeaStorm platform to solicit customer suggestions and
have then used these suggestions for product development and service
improvements. This kind of responsiveness can be a powerful way to
make customers feel a sense of ownership and contribution to a company’s
success.
􀁲􀀁 Hosting a community: In some cases, it may make sense for a business
to host its own online community around a shared topic of interest.
38 HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS
Technology provider SAP hosts the SAP Community Network so customers,
business partners, employees, and others can share insights
and discuss questions related to their overlapping technology needs.
The network has over a million unique visitors per month. Procter &
Gamble had difficulty marketing feminine hygiene products, so it built
BeingGirl.com, a forum where teen girls can discuss the experiences
and challenges of young womanhood. Letting customers lead the conversation,
P&G found that BeingGirl delivered a sales ROI several times
higher than that for their TV ads for Tampax and Always brands.16
The keys to a connect strategy are focusing on the social media your
customers use and engaging in conversations to solve problems, learn
about your market, and become closer to your customers. The goal is not
conversation for its own sake but value creation for your business.
Collaborate Strategy
The collaborate strategy for business is to invite your customers to help
build your enterprise. A collaborate strategy is distinct from a connect
strategy in that the company invites customers not just to share information
but also to work together in a focused way toward a shared goal or
objective, using open platforms. Wikipedia is still the touchstone example
of digital collaboration that most people are familiar with—an unmatched
public resource, generated almost entirely by the volunteer efforts of contributors
around the world. But Wikipedia has evolved only through careful
iterations of its editorial process to ensure its reliability and usefulness.
Mass collaboration does not happen without careful attention to creating
the right context and the right motivations for participants to take action
and to feel they are being fairly treated.
We see a few well-established broad approaches to a collaborate strategy,
including passive contribution, active contribution, crowdfunding,
open competitions, and collaborative platforms.
􀁲􀀁 Passive contribution: Sometimes collaboration can involve as little as customers’
consent so that actions they are already taking can be used to
power a collective project. The Waze navigation app is one such collaborative
tool; simply by driving a car with the mobile app running, each
customer provides real-time data on the speed of traffic and best routes to
destinations. Duolingo, a free language-learning app, includes translation
HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS39
homework for students—and then uses those homework assignments to
power the second part of its business, a Web translation tool.
􀁲􀀁 Active contribution: In other cases, customers are invited to contribute
their efforts directly to a cause, taking on a small part of a large project.
CNN’s iReport allows anyone to contribute photos, videos, or eyewitness
reports to a crowdsourced journalism website. When the images
or stories are particularly newsworthy, they are picked up and included
in the main CNN news broadcast, with credit given to the “iReporter”
who happened to be on the scene.
􀁲􀀁 Crowdfunding: A type of active contribution that has become quite widespread,
crowdfunding is the process of seeking collaborators to contribute
to and raise funds for a new project, product launch, or initiative.
Crowdfunding started as a way for artists to raise funds but quickly
spread as a means to raise seed capital for new businesses (including
start-ups Oculus Rift and Pebble Watch) and diverse other ventures. In
some markets, crowdfunded projects are legally allowed to grant equity
directly to funders. This approach has been used by real estate crowdfunder
Prodigy Network to raise the capital for and begin construction
of the tallest building in Colombia, the BD Bacatá skyscraper.
􀁲􀀁 Open competitions: Some problems cannot be easily divided among
contributors. In these cases, competitions can be used to enlist a
diverse group to find the best answer or solution. Cisco has invested in
a variety of innovation competitions, from an I-Prize business model
competition, to hackathons for outside programmers to develop technical
solutions, to the Internet of Things. InnoCentive hosts a network
of over 300,000 “solvers”—scientists, engineers, and technical experts
around the world—who can be tapped by any company seeking to run
a competition to solve an intractable R&D challenge.
􀁲􀀁 Collaborative platforms: In this approach, the business creates a context
for collaboration but lets the network of collaborators define the
challenges to be addressed. In the iPhone’s second year on the market,
Apple opened up the operating system as a platform for collaboration.
This experiment triggered the explosion of outside innovation that is
the App Store. A good collaborative platform doesn’t try to define what
the next crop of projects should be; it focuses on providing a structure
on which others can build. (We’ll see much more on platform business
models in the next chapter.)
The keys to a collaborate strategy are understanding the motivations
of your contributors, giving everyone a stake (so no one feels exploited),
40 HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS
allowing participants to contribute at their proper level of expertise, and
offering freedom for contributors to bring their own ideas while providing
enough guidance to shape an effective final outcome.
We now have a clear understanding of the five customer network strategies.
But how do you choose between them and know which to apply in
a given business situation? That is the aim of this chapter’s tool, which we
will see next.
Tool: The Customer Network Strategy Generator
The Customer Network Strategy Generator is designed to help you develop
new strategic ideas for engaging and creating value with networked customers.
It does this by linking your own business objectives to the core
behaviors of customer networks that we have examined in this chapter.
It can be used to generate new marketing communications and customer
experiences as well as new product and service innovations.
The tool follows a five-step process for generating new strategic ideas
(see figure 2.5). Let’s look at each of the steps in detail.

Step 1: Objective Setting
The first step of this process is to define the objectives you are hoping to
achieve for your business with any new customer strategy you develop. It
is valuable to define objectives at two levels: direct objectives and higherorder
objectives.
􀁲􀀁 Direct objectives: These are the objectives that you are directly responsible
for addressing in your project. For example, if you were leading
customer service, you might be seeking to develop new strategies that
leverage customers’ digital behaviors to increase the speed of response
to customer queries, reduce attrition of dissatisfied customers, or
turn customer service into a source of customer insights. If you were
responsible for developing direct-to-consumer sales for the first time
via e-commerce, you might be seeking to drive awareness and product
discoverability, reduce friction in the purchase decision, and engage
lead customers as evangelists for your new sales channel.
􀁲􀀁 Higher-order objectives: It is also important to identify what overarching,
or higher-order, objectives you are seeking to support through
your initiative. These are objectives that you are not solely responsible
for but that your project should support. In the e-commerce example
above, you might identify developing richer data sets about customers
across all channels as a firm-wide objective that your initiative should
support. This would impact how you plan for your initiative to support
that data collection and integration.
Step 2: Customer Selection and Focusing
The next step is to get a clear picture of the customers that you are seeking
to address. This starts with selecting which customer segments are
most relevant to your stated objectives. For example, if your key project
objective were to reduce customer attrition, you might select customer
segments with the highest rates of attrition and high-value segments
whose losses pose the greatest risk. If your project were aimed at increasing
the acquisition of a group of customers who are often influenced
by opinion leaders, you would want to include both these segments in
your plan.
42 HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS
Then you need to focus on these segments to understand them in the
context of your project’s specific objectives. That involves answering three
key questions:
What is my unique objective for each customer segment? If you are
focusing on different segments to launch your new e-commerce service,
how does your objective differ—even slightly—for each of them? Perhaps,
for one segment, the objective is simply to drive early adoption;
for another highly active segment, you want not just adoption but also
customer feedback and assistance in iterating the platform; for a third
segment, you want to convince customers to set up recurring contracts
with the new service.
What is my unique value proposition for each customer segment? It
is important to see how the value proposition (the reason for customers
to give you their time, attention, and money) varies among segments. For
one customer segment, the value proposition of your e-commerce service
may be simplicity in placing orders; for another, it may be a better selection
of products; for another, it may be better record keeping for past and
future orders.
What are the unique barriers to success for each customer segment?
Barriers could vary from lack of awareness of a new offer to indifference,
price sensitivity, technical hurdles, or risk aversion, among others. For each
customer segment, try to articulate what the biggest barrier is and see how
it differs from the others.
Step 3: Strategy Selection
Now that you know your objectives for your customer strategy and have
a strong understanding of the customers you are trying to reach, you are
ready to start the strategy ideation process.
You should begin by looking back at the five core customer network
behaviors and the broad strategies that derive from them:
􀁲􀀁 Access: Be faster, be easier, be everywhere, and be always on for your
customers.
􀁲􀀁 Engage: Become a source of valued content for your customers.
􀁲􀀁 Customize: Make your offering adaptable to your customers’ needs.
􀁲􀀁 Connect: Become a part of your customers’ conversations.
􀁲􀀁 Collaborate: Invite your customers to help build your enterprise.
HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS43
Although all five strategies can be valuable for your business in the
abstract, you are now looking to generate ideas for a specific project. Consider
the objectives you have set and the customers you are trying to reach
(including their needs, barriers, etc.). Use these objectives and target customers
to select one or more of the five strategies that seem best suited for
the task.
For example, if you are launching an e-commerce platform and one of
the key motivators of your customer segments is a simple and frictionless
interface, then you should think about generating ideas for an access strategy.
If you are seeking to capture ideas from the customer service interactions
of your customers, then a focus on conversation in a connect strategy
would be appropriate. If you are aiming to recruit a group of customer
evangelists to beta test a new product and help introduce it to markets, then
a collaborate strategy would fit.
You may decide that more than one of the five broad strategies make
sense for your goals—for example, an access and a customize strategy or
an engage and a connect strategy. But I would advise against selecting all
five, as the goal here is to set a focused direction before concept generation
begins.
Step 4: Concept Generation
Now you are ready to start generating specific strategic concepts based on
the broad strategies, objectives, and customers you have selected. A concept
is a specific, concrete idea for a product, service, communication, experience,
or interaction you design for customers. For example, if you are pursuing
an engage strategy (becoming a source of valued content) as part of
introducing a new premium VIP service to customers of your travel booking
service, you should consider creating a variety of kinds of content: an
“explainer” video showing how the new service works simply and easily via
your mobile device, short lifestyle reports on up-and-coming travel recommendations
that customers can subscribe to based on their travel interests,
a news alert service to tell them about travel safety conditions in regions on
their upcoming agenda, and so on. Even if you have chosen only one broad
strategy, you should aim to generate several different strategic concepts.
As you begin this step, you may want to look back at the different
cases and approaches given earlier in the chapter for each of the strategies.
For example, if you are looking at a customize strategy, you may want to
44 HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS
consider ideas related to recommendation engines, personalized interfaces,
personalized products and services, and personalized messages and content.
This step is fundamentally a creative, idea-generating effort. You will
want to bring together a diverse group of people who are ready to push
themselves to generate new thinking. A small team (about five people)
from different backgrounds and areas of the organization is ideal. Make
sure everyone is steeped in the project objectives and the customer segments
as you’ve defined them. Look for benchmarks and creative ideas
from outside your industry. And be honest about whether you are just trying
to catch up with your competitors or looking to create a compelling and
differentiating new offering.
Lastly, it is critical to keep the focus on how your new ideas can create
value for the customer. If they don’t, they are unlikely to succeed. Following
are some questions to keep you focused on customer value.
FOR AN ACCESS STRATEGY
􀁲􀀁 How could you make the experience faster, simpler, easier for
customers?
􀁲􀀁 How could you better integrate different interactions?
􀁲􀀁 How could you make the service more accessible, more on-demand,
more self-serve?
FOR AN ENGAGE STRATEGY
􀁲􀀁 How could you earn the attention of your audience?
􀁲􀀁 What problem could you solve for your customers with the right content
or information at the right time?
􀁲􀀁 Would anyone not working at your company recommend this content
to a friend?
FOR A CUSTOMIZE STRATEGY
􀁲􀀁 Where do your customers’ needs and interests differ most from each
other?
􀁲􀀁 Why would your customers want a more personalized experience? For
better utility? For unique interests? For self-expression?
􀁲􀀁 How could you make it easy, and not overwhelming, for your customers
to make the right choice for themselves?
HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS45
FOR A CONNECT STRATEGY
􀁲􀀁 What conversations are your customers already having that are relevant
to your objectives?
􀁲􀀁 How could you enable, facilitate, or enhance those conversations rather
than intruding on them?
􀁲􀀁 What could you learn from your customers’ conversations?
􀁲􀀁 What could you contribute to these conversations that your customers
would value?
FOR A COLLABORATE STRATEGY
􀁲􀀁 What skills could your customers bring to bear, and what are the limits
in their ability to contribute successfully?
􀁲􀀁 What would most motivate customers? Excitement about your brand,
cause, or project? Social recognition? Monetary rewards? Or some
combination of these?
􀁲􀀁 How could you make sure customers feel validated and rewarded?
Step 5: Defining Impact
At this point, you should bring each of your ideas back to the business
objectives you set for yourself in step 1. For each strategic concept, you need
to answer these questions: If you do proceed with this, how will you know
if you have achieved the objectives you set? For example, if your objective
is to reduce customer attrition, will the strategy you have developed address
this? If so, how will you measure its impact? If your objective is to drive
product awareness and discoverability and you have developed a series of
content initiatives as part of an engage strategy, how will you know if they
are achieving your goal? The point here is to articulate a measurable benefit
to your company and clarify how you think the strategic concepts you have
developed will achieve this outcome.
Having completed all five steps, you should now have a set of compelling
new customer strategies for your team to consider for implementation.
These should be strategies rooted in a deep understanding of your specific
customers, based on their own networked behaviors, designed to add real
value for these customers, and able to drive the objectives most important
to your business.
46 HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS
This tool has been designed for strategic ideation. Still to come would be any
planning to test your strategic concepts, validate them, allocate resources
to them, refine their metrics, and (if appropriate) move to a public launch.
We will talk more about how to test and learn from new strategic ideas in
chapter 5.
Before we leave the domain of customer strategy, though, let’s consider
some of the challenges that a traditional, pre-digital-era enterprise may face
in rethinking its assumptions about customers.
Organizational Challenges of Customer Networks
Joseph Tripodi knows something about customer networks. Over the
course of his career, he has served as the chief marketing officer at Allstate
Insurance, The Bank of New York, MasterCard, Seagram, and Coca-
Cola. When I spoke to him about his view of the changing relationship of
organizations to customers, he told me, “For any large organization, this is
definitely a journey. We’re waking up to the fact that we’ve been too passive
by trying to engage with consumers in more traditional ways. How do you
build an infrastructure for ongoing, real-time consumer engagement? It’s a
challenge for behemoth companies who operate around the world.”17
For some time, Tripodi has been thinking about customer networks in
terms of three different networks. One network is end consumers. Another
is business customers, whether retailers, analysts, or opinion elites who
influence your industry and regulations. The third is your own employees.
Enabling the Network Inside
A firm’s internal customer network—its own employees—is critical to
the digital transformation of a business. That transformation begins with
applying the same customer network strategies we have seen to help internal
teams achieve their goals. As workforces become more mobile, businesses
need to help employees access their work more easily and flexibly.
Employees need to be able to engage with the right content, information,
and resources to stay informed for their job. They need tools that allow
them to customize their workflow around flexible travel, roles, and schedules.
They need to connect with each other—to share knowledge and to ask
and answer questions—using various modes of communication (e-mails,
HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS47
instant messages, videoconferences) without confusion. And they need to
be able to collaborate using tools that allow them to share projects and files
while working remotely and asynchronously.
As big a challenge as all this may be, the bigger challenges are often
cultural. As Tripodi told me, “We have to evolve to be a much more permeable
hierarchy, where information is collected, gathered, analyzed, and
shared at all levels.”
Reducing hierarchical control is rarely easy. Many times, distrust of
employees and fear of risk can lead organizations to wall off digital connections
and restrict employees from using online tools effectively. The
head of human resources for a billion-dollar business unit of a large multinational
firm confessed to me that even she was not able to access YouTube
while at work. The IT department forbade tablet computers and sealed
off employees behind a tight firewall. If she wanted to find educational
content for her own staff, she had to search from her home computer on
the weekends. So much for using technology to educate and connect your
workforce! Walling off employees because you fear their freedom to connect
digitally is a losing strategy.
Nurturing an effective employee network is all the more important as
the size of a firm increases, as its geographical disparity increases (making
casual face-to-face interactions more difficult), and as its employees’ and
executives’ jobs change more rapidly.
Adding New Skills and Replacing Old Habits
In order to leverage customer networks outside the firm, businesses are
having to acquire a host of new skills, particularly in their customer-facing
divisions, including marketing, communications, sales, and service.
These skills include social media and community management, journalistic
content creation, new media buying and measurement, e-commerce,
and more. The challenge for established businesses is to avoid outsourcing
these tasks to expert agencies—a quick and easy but shortsighted way to
bridge the skills gap. Outsourcing delays the process of integrating new
skills into the organization, and integration is essential to developing strategic
thinking and new ideas that go beyond what competitors are doing.
In many companies, these new networked skills exist but are unevenly
distributed. I have worked with global firms facing a wide gap in digital
skills and perspectives among executives at the same level of leadership.
48 HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS
These companies have employees with great digital skills, but they are scattered
across departments and isolated at different levels of seniority (not
just among young millennials). Among the key challenges for such firms
are sharing best practices internally and quickly bringing employees to a
baseline level of shared knowledge.
Many organizations simply find that old habits die hard. The employees
who have been most successful and earned their stripes with the old
tools of broadcast marketing (buying TV ads and sending out print mailings)
may be the ones most resistant to adopting a new, more networked
approach to customers. “Getting the corporation to apply its energy to
reskilling the team is difficult culturally,” Tripodi says. “It’s a new world
order, but the challenge is that people want to rely on what got them there
before.” It is often much easier to keep spending money where you used
to (even without clear measures of ROI) than to shift spending into new
tactics for engaging customers.
Bridging Silos
Another challenge for organizations is that customer networks affect every
department of the organization. This can lead to tensions over who leads
customer interactions across digital touchpoints. It can be as mundane an
issue as who owns the company’s Facebook presence: Marketing? Communications?
Customer service? IT? Should that presence be managed by
global headquarters or devolved to local business units, each with its own
page? Even if one department is responsible for the “voice” of the company
in a given social media platform, the strategy needs to be able to support
the diverse needs of the entire business. I have seen a global telecom company
struggle because the department that had ownership of social media
was inflexible when an external crisis led to another department’s asking for
support for its own objectives.
As technology becomes more central to all customer interactions,
rivalries can arise between the marketing and IT departments. (Numerous
studies have been conducted about the changing relationship of the
chief marketing and chief information officers.) It is critical that the two
disciplines learn to work together effectively, despite differences in culture,
budget, and priorities. At Kimberly-Clark, for example, the solution was
to create liaison positions on both sides: a vice president of IT focused
entirely on partnering with the global marketing team and an equivalent
HARNESS CUSTOMER NETWORKS49
leadership position on the marketing side focused on partnering with IT.18
Some firms, like Motorola, have gone so far as to merge the CMO and CIO
into a joint position.
The strongest argument for bridging the traditional silos of a company
is the need to integrate the total customer experience with a firm and its
brand. When Frank Eliason came to Citibank to take on the role of senior
vice president of social media, he faced this challenge. “Inside your business,
you may see yourselves as lots of different units: we’re in mortgages;
business loans is someone else, and personal checking is different altogether.
But from the point of view of the customer, we’re all just one brand,
Citi. And when they interact with your brand on social media, they expect
to be able to ask about any part of their experience with your company.”19

To adapt and thrive in the digital age, businesses must learn to view customers
differently, understanding the dynamic, networked ways in which
they interact, now both with businesses and with each other. By learning to
think about customers as networks and to think differently about the path
to purchase and the marketing funnel, any business can begin to transform
its customer strategies. It can meet customers where they are and add value
to both sides of the relationship by helping them to access, engage, connect,
and even collaborate with the business.
But relationships with individual customers are not the only ones that
are changing in the digital age. The interactions between businesses are
being similarly transformed. What used to be fairly simple, even binary
relationships (partner or competitor) have become more complex and interconnected.
This shift requires new thinking about how businesses interact
with each other and new models for creating value when one business
becomes a platform for others. This will be the focus of the next chapter.
In 2007, two recent graduates of the Rhode Island School of Design, Brian
Chesky and Joe Gebbia, were struggling to pay the rent on their apartment
in San Francisco. When they heard that the city’s hotels were fully booked
during an upcoming design conference, they had an entrepreneurial idea:
Why not rent out a bit of their space? They bought three airbeds (inflatable
mattresses), put up a website, and, within six days, found three guest lodgers.
Each one paid $80 a night. “As we were waving these people goodbye,
Joe and I looked at each other and thought, there’s got to be a bigger idea
here,” Chesky said.1 By the following year, they had teamed up with another
friend, computer science graduate Nathan Blecharczyk, and started a business
that they later named Airbnb.
By 2015, Airbnb had served 25 million travelers, providing them with
lodging in over 190 countries around the world. But it doesn’t look like a
typical global corporation in the business of providing lodging and hospitality.
Instead of building hotels and hiring employees to serve customers,
the three founders built a platform that brings together two distinct types

Build Platforms, Not Just Products
COMPETITION
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS51
of people: hosts with homes to rent (whether a spare room or their whole
home while they are away) and travelers who are looking for someplace to
stay. The company has minimal assets. In fact, it doesn’t own a single rental
property. Yet it can offer travelers their choice of more than 1 million listings,
ranging from a sofa or tiny guest room up to an actual castle (more
than 600 are available to rent). The company takes a cut of the rental fee
on each transaction.
Airbnb has only a few hundred employees but manages to book 40
million guest-nights per year because its platform is built to be as simple
and self-service as possible for both homeowners and travelers. Its staff
focuses on building a Web interface and mobile apps that make it as easy
and frictionless as possible for a host to offer lodging or for a traveler to
find a place to stay.
Much of Airbnb’s success comes down to building trust between the
two parties. (Who wants to have their apartment trashed by out-of-town
guests when they are on vacation? Who wants to show up at a dump that
doesn’t match what you booked online?) Building trust begins with mutual
ratings and reviews for both hosts and travelers but goes far beyond that.
The company waits to release rental payments to the host until after the
renter has checked in and verified they are happy with the property; it
likewise holds onto the renter’s deposit until after they have left and the
host has verified their home is in good shape. As further assurance, it provides
each host with $1 million in insurance for damages. It has also added
verification of both parties through detailed user profiles, ID verification,
and links to social networks like Facebook. Travelers looking for options
in a destination city can search by neighborhood, can read the company’s
curated recommendations on where to stay, and can even use Facebook to
find “friends of friends” who are renting out spaces. Its founders were even
able to mix trust building and marketing: by hiring photographers to take
pictures of lodgings for any host who requested it (for free), they offered
better visuals for the host while guaranteeing visitors that the company
had verified the location they were renting. This innovation alone rapidly
increased growth in bookings.
Airbnb has grown at a phenomenal rate, with more rooms for rent
than Hilton, InterContinental, or Marriott2 and nearly $4 billion in gross
bookings in 2014.3 During that year’s World Cup games, out of 600,000
attendees who came to Brazil from around the world, 25 percent stayed
at an Airbnb rental. Today, the company operates in over 190 countries.

“Every country other than North Korea, Iran, Syria, and Cuba,” Chesky
cheerfully told television host Stephen Colbert in a 2014 interview.4 That
list has since been updated: when the United States reestablished ties with
Cuba in 2015, Airbnb was one of the first American companies to announce
it had launched a presence there.5
Rethinking Competition
Airbnb is an example of a platform—a class of businesses that are rethinking
which competitive assets need to be owned by a firm (e.g., rental properties
and trained service staff) and which can be managed through new
kinds of external relationships.
These platform businesses are part of a broad transformation of the
domain of competition and the relationships between firms. In the past,
competition took place between similar rival businesses and within clearly
defined industries with stable boundaries. Businesses created value within
their own organization and in partnership with their suppliers and sales
channels. But in the digital age, the boundaries between industries are blurring,
and so is the distinction between partners and competitors. Every
relationship between firms today is a constantly shifting mix of competition
and cooperation.
Think of the television business. In the traditional view, a network
like HBO partners with cable companies for distribution, and it competes
with networks like Showtime or AMC—companies with the same business
model and a similar offering for customers. But as digitization has transformed
media, HBO has found itself competing with Netflix, an asymmetric
challenger that is going after the same customers with a different pricing
model and a completely different means of distribution. As the boundaries
of the “television” industry have been redefined, HBO must compete
for leverage against its distribution partners, cable companies like Comcast
and Time Warner (which previously owned HBO’s parent company).
It also must compete for leverage against some of its own star talent, who
now have the option to work with firms like Netflix or Amazon as they
develop their own original programming for direct distribution to viewers.
At the same time, three of the biggest broadcast television networks—ABC,
NBC, and Fox—have put aside their rivalry to cooperate in creating Hulu,
a digital channel that aggregates all their content for online viewing with
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS53
a mix of advertising and subscriber revenue. Clearly, the shape of interfirm
competition and cooperation in the world of television has gotten very
complicated.
The digital revolution is redefining competition and relationships
between firms in several ways. It is supercharging the growth of platform
businesses like Airbnb. For businesses like HBO, it is disintermediating and
reshuffling channel and partner relationships. More broadly, it is shifting
the locus of competition: competition is happening less within industries
and less between similar companies that seek to replace each other; it is
happening more across industries and between partners who rely on each
other for success. Lastly, digital technology is increasing the importance of
“co-opetition,” where companies that compete directly in some arenas find
it valuable to act as partners in other areas. (See table 3.1.)
This chapter explores the changing dynamics of competition and interfirm
relationships and their particular impact on platform businesses. It
also presents two strategic planning tools. The first is the Platform Business
Model Map, which can be used to analyze or design new platform businesses
by understanding how they exchange value between different kinds of partners.
The second is the Competitive Value Train, which provides a lens for
understanding the simultaneous competition and cooperation among supply
chain partners, traditional rivals, and asymmetric competitors and for
planning strategic moves to increase a business’s competitive leverage.
Let’s start by looking more deeply at the concept of platform businesses
and what they tell us about the shifting roles of competition and
cooperation.

Rise of the Platform
Airbnb is just of one of many new digitally powered businesses that act as
platforms—bringing together two or more parties to create and exchange
value through the business rather than trying to create all the value
themselves.
Marketplaces like eBay, Etsy, or Alibaba’s Taobao bring together buyers
and sellers of goods of all kinds in direct sales or auctions. Matchmaking
services like Uber or Didi Kuaidi provide taxi services not by purchasing
vehicles and hiring drivers but by providing a platform to connect drivers
in their own cars with people nearby needing a car service. Media companies
from YouTube to Forbes.com operate by bringing together independent
content creators, content consumers, and advertisers—each of
whom is seeking out the other. Mobile operating systems like Apple’s iOS,
Google’s Android, and Xiaomi’s MIUI compete by attracting the best software
developers to create apps, which, in turn, draw consumers to buy their
smartphones.

Platforms represent a fundamental shift in how businesses relate to
each other—from linear to more networked business models. Platform businesses
can often be very light in assets but generate large revenues. Instead
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS55
of building features and seeking to get customers to use their own products,
they build ecosystems by getting customers to interact with each other. Rather
than simply paying for services received, customers both provide value and
receive value. As a result, the value of a platform grows as more people use it.
What Is a Platform Business Model?
Vagueness abounds in the current use of the word platform, whose most
general meaning is “something on which you can build.” In tech circles, a
platform may be any underlying software on which additional programs
are built. In media industries, it may mean a distribution channel. In marketing,
it may refer to any brand or product line that could be used to
launch additional products. In the context of this chapter, however, we will
be discussing platforms in a specific sense—as a kind of business model.
Origins of Platform Theory
The idea of platforms as business model has its origins in the economic theories
of two-sided markets developed by Jean-Charles Rochet and Nobel
laureate Jean Tirole,6 along with Thomas Eisenmann, Geoffrey Parker,
Marshall Van Alstyne,7 and others. Their work examines pricing and competition
in markets where one business serves two different types of customers
that are dependent on each other. They found that the two sides
often show different price sensitivity and that in efficient markets one side
often subsidizes the other (e.g., advertisers subsidize the cost of media for
consumers, and merchants cover the transaction costs of credit cards for
the shoppers using them).
The study of two-sided markets led, in turn, to the realization that the
same effects could be seen in markets with more than two types of customers
(Visa and MasterCard, for example, bring together not just the consumers
who use credit cards and the merchants who accept them but the
credit-issuing banks that back them as well). This led to the more general
concept of multisided markets. At the same time, the theory began to shift
from looking at the market dynamics (i.e., who will pay what price in equilibrium
with others) to looking at the kind of businesses that make them
possible (i.e., what distinguishes the business model of a Visa or Master-
Card and what its success factors are).
56 BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS
The term in economics for the business model at the center of a multisided
market is a multisided platform, or just platform. Going forward, you
can take my use of the term platform to refer to these multisided platform
business models.
It is by applying these economic theories that we can begin to understand
the power and unique value of businesses like Airbnb, Uber, or Xiaomi.
A Definition of Platforms
The most precise and illuminating description of what constitutes a platform
comes from the work of Andrei Hagiu and Julian Wright.8 To condense
their thinking, I offer this definition:
A platform is a business that creates value by facilitating direct interactions
between two or more distinct types of customers.
Three key points from Hagiu and Wright that I include in this definition
are worth noting:
􀁲􀀁 Distinct types of customers: To be a platform, the business model must
serve two or more distinct sides, or types, of customers. (These can be
buyers and sellers, software developers and consumers, merchants and
cardholders and banks, etc.) The need for distinct sides explains why a
pure communication network (such as Skype, fax, or telephone) is not
a platform: although it connects customers to each other, the customers
are all of the same type. The unique dynamics of platforms arise
because they bring together different parties that each play different
roles and contribute and receive different kinds of value.
􀁲􀀁 Direct interaction: Platforms must enable these two or more sides to
interact directly—that is, with a degree of independence. In a platform
such as Airbnb or eBay, the two parties are free to create their own
profiles, set and negotiate pricing, and decide how they want to present
their services or products. This is a critical distinction between a
platform and a reseller or sales channel. The independence of interaction
is why our definition of platforms does not include a supermarket
connecting brands with shoppers or a vertically integrated consulting
firm connecting clients with its hired employees.
􀁲􀀁 Facilitating: Even though the interactions are not dictated by the platform
business, they must take place through it and be facilitated by it.
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS57
This is why our definition of platforms does not include a franchise
business like McDonald’s or H&R Block, which provides brand licensing,
training, and support services to individual owners who open
branch businesses. Although franchisors do, in some sense, enable
commerce between the franchisees (e.g., restaurant owners) and end
consumers (e.g., restaurant patrons), that commerce does not flow
through the original corporation, and only one party (the franchisee)
is in any way affiliated with the original franchisor company.
In table 3.2, we can see how a number of different platforms bring
together distinct types of customers and create value by facilitating their
direct interaction.

Four Types of Platforms
Platform business models are not new to the digital age, although (as we
shall see) digital technologies are fueling their increasing spread and dominance.
But even before the rise of mobile computing or the Internet or
even information technology, platform business models could be seen in a
variety of forms.
David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee identify four broad types of
platform businesses (see table 3.3):9
􀁲􀀁 Exchanges: These types of platforms (sometimes also called marketplaces)
bring together two distinct groups of customers for a direct value
exchange, with each group attracted by the number and quality from the
other side. One familiar example would be real estate brokers, who bring
together buyers and sellers. Another would be a shopping mall, which
promotes itself as a shopping destination to consumers and rents space
to various vendors. Digital exchanges can bring together buyers and sellers
of products (such as eBay) as well as services (such as Airbnb).

BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS59
􀁲􀀁 Transaction systems: These platforms act as an intermediary between
different parties to facilitate payments and financial transactions.
Issuers of both credit cards and debit cards provide this service, linking
together cardholders, merchants, and banks. New digital payment
systems, whether PayPal or Apple Pay, are based on the same
model. To succeed, a transaction system must get sufficient numbers
on board from each party: merchants will install card readers and
accept the fees owed to the platform only if they see a sizable number
of customers using the system; customers will be more likely to
sign up if they see that the service is widely accepted by merchants
that they buy from.
􀁲􀀁 Advertising-supported media: In this case, the platform typically
plays an additional role of creating (or sourcing) media content that
is attractive to consumers. For example, a printed newspaper or an
online news publication hires writers to create professional content.
Once the value of the content attracts an audience, the platform can
charge advertisers who are eager to present their messages to that
audience. As the platform attracts more people, its value to advertisers
increases. The advertisers, in turn, provide value to the audience
by reducing or eliminating the cost of the content for them.
􀁲􀀁 Hardware/software standards: These platforms provide a uniform standard
for the design of subsequent products to enable their interoperability
and benefit the ultimate consumer. At the birth of color television,
a struggle took place between RCA and CBS to determine which would
establish the standard used by broadcasters and television set manufacturers
(RCA won). Later the introduction of videocassette tapes
resulted in a competition between the VHS and Betamax standards for
hardware (VHS won). But not every standards competition ends with a
single winner. Today’s smartphone market is roughly divided between
Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. Each of these operating systems
is a software platform vying to attract more software developers that
will build apps; in addition, Android serves as a hardware platform for
handset manufacturers like Samsung that are seeking to compete with
Apple’s iPhone.
This list is not exclusive; new platform businesses could well arise
that don’t quite fit any of these four types. But these categories provide
a useful way of thinking about the differences among current platform
businesses.
60 BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS
Direct and Indirect Network Effects
One of the key features of platforms is that their value increases as more
customers use them. This phenomenon is commonly called network effects,
but there are actually two different kinds of network effects that can impact
the growth of a business.
Direct network effects (or “same-side” network effects) occur when the
increasing number of customers or users of a product drives an increase in
value or utility for that same type of user. In communications theory, this
is commonly dubbed Metcalfe’s law. When the first user purchased a fax
machine, the utility was zero: Who could they dial? As the number of users
increases, each additional user leads to an exponential increase in the number
of potential connections that can be made in the network (connections =
n(n – 1)/2). Direct network effects occur in platforms such as Facebook,
which is a platform because (unlike a fax machine) it brings together not just
users but advertisers, publishers, and app developers as well.
For platforms, the more common type of network effect is indirect network
effects (or “cross-side” network effects). These occur when an increase
in the number and quality of customers on one side of the platform drives
increasing value for customers on the other side of the platform. You don’t
sign up for Visa because it has lots of other cardholders (no direct network
effect), but the presence of lots of Visa cardholders does make it more
attractive for a merchant to accept Visa (strong indirect network effect).
Are indirect network effects reciprocal? Not always. In advertisingsupported
media, the indirect network effects usually run only one way:
as the number of readers increases for a newspaper, its value to advertisers
increases as well, but increasing the number of ads in each issue does not
directly increase the value for readers. (The one exception would be classified
ads, where the ads really are the “content” that the audience goes to
the publication to read.) For media companies, that imbalance is critical in
determining pricing for both sides.
But for platforms other than ad-supported media, the indirect network
effects usually do work both ways. Airbnb renters like to see more hosts to
choose from, and hosts want to see more potential renters on the site. When
indirect network effects happen both ways, they drive a virtuous cycle, with
new customers on each side increasing the attractiveness to the other side. This
is what drives extremely rapid growth and a highly defensible market position
for a platform like Airbnb or PayPal that becomes a leader in its category.

The Platform Spectrum
Any business today faces a strategic choice of whether to pursue a platform
model or a more traditional business model. Should you build a store
or a marketplace? Should you hire a group of experts or cultivate a network
of them? But the choice is not a simple “all or nothing” decision. The
right business model may be somewhere on a spectrum from platform to
nonplatform.
Consider the second defining quality of platforms: they allow direct
and independent interaction between the parties they bring together. In
practice, this independence may happen by degrees. Both Uber and Relay-
Rides allow owners of cars to provide mobility to those without them (in
the former, the car comes with a driver; in the latter, you borrow the car
and drive it yourself). But whereas RelayRides lets riders offer their own
price, Uber imposes standardization around rates. Within the category of
electronic gaming, both consoles like Microsoft’s Xbox and app stores like
Google Play act as platforms, bringing together designers who have games
to sell and gamers who are looking to buy. However, the console makers
exert more control on the interaction: although the game developers set the
pricing, the actual purchase contract is between the gamer and Microsoft.
On the Google Play store, the parties are given more independence: the
gamer buys the app from the third-party designer, but Google maintains
quality review.10
Some companies successfully employ a mix of platform and nonplatform
business models, even within the same business unit. Amazon.com
started as a pure e-commerce business, buying and selling products just like
a physical retailer. But it later launched Amazon Marketplace, which allows
independent stores to offer goods for sale on Amazon’s website, greatly
expanding its product breadth and enhancing Amazon’s margins. The platform
and nonplatform businesses sit side by side; in fact, products from
both appear in the same search result on Amazon’s website. In the retail
world, electronics chain Best Buy was long a traditional reseller, controlling
all aspects of how products are priced, displayed, and sold in its stores. More
recently, though, it has allowed major brands such as Samsung, Microsoft,
Sony, Google, and Apple to lease space in its retail stores and operate independent,
branded mini-stores that are designed, stocked, and even staffed
with salespeople from the brand itself. With its mini-stores, Best Buy is
using a platform model that connects shoppers with the brands directly.
62 BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS
In some cases, both parts of the business may be significant: in 2014,
Amazon reported that 42 percent of its units sold were from its Marketplace
partners. When India’s laws prevented foreign companies from conducting
direct sales in e-commerce, Amazon entered the market with a 100
percent platform strategy, allowing local retailers to sell products through
Amazon.in and its fulfillment services. In other cases, one business model
may serve only particular customers. Evernote provides cloud-based notetaking
software to 100 million users (I’m one of them). It also has an Evernote
Platform that allows independent developers to build additional apps
for Evernote users and an Evernote Market for independently made hardware
and accessories; these offerings skew mostly toward customers with
enterprise licenses, further widening the customer base.11
The decision whether to pursue a platform business model can shift
over time. Shoe retailer Zappos.com started as a platform (a marketplace
for designer shoe brands and consumers) but pivoted its strategy to become
a direct reseller. Apple famously lost the desktop wars to Microsoft because
it sought to control the development of software and hardware, whereas
Microsoft aggressively pursued a platform strategy for Windows, seeking
out as many partners (both PC makers and software developers) as possible.
Apple almost made the same mistake with the iPhone before a major
strategic change in its second year, when Steve Jobs allowed outside developers
to begin writing apps for the new phone. Sales increased 245 percent
that year, and the iPhone as a multisided platform business went on to
make Apple the most valuable company in the world.
How Digital Impacts Platforms
As we have seen, multisided platforms have been around in various forms
for many years. The basic model of an exchange probably dates back to
the earliest markets where a landlord or municipal government owned the
property and leased out stalls or patches of dirt to merchants who could
peddle their wares to customers drawn by the market’s promise.
So why are platform businesses so important now? Why are they
growing so quickly and influencing so many sectors? Digital technologies
are supercharging the growth and power of multisided platforms. These
enabling technologies include the Web; on-demand cloud computing;
application program interfaces (APIs), which increase the interoperability
of data and functionality; social media; and mobile computing devices.
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS63
Together, these digital technologies are driving four key elements of
platforms:
􀁲􀀁 Frictionless acquisition: Thanks to the Web, APIs, and software development
kits (SDKs), the process of acquiring new customers for a platform
is increasingly frictionless. There is no longer a need to negotiate
terms for each additional participant in a multisided platform, removing
a critical bottleneck to growth. For example, to place an ad on a
television program, an advertiser needs to meet and negotiate directly
with the network (or via a media buyer as intermediary) and may even
need to commit to the purchase months in advance during an up-front
purchase period. By contrast, to place an ad on Google to be seen by
customers searching on specific keywords, an advertiser simply goes to
the Google AdWords website, enters its credit card information, and
begins using a self-service tool to test, launch, and optimize its advertising
campaign in real time.
􀁲􀀁 Scalable growth: Cloud computing now allows any size business to rapidly
scale the size of its platform as fast as it can acquire new customers.
By taking a physical service like car transport or lodging reservations and
moving it to a cloud-based platform, companies like Uber and Airbnb
can expand with virtually no ceiling on their growth. A traditional nightclub
may thrive as a platform that attracts mutually attractive customers,
but if it grows quickly, it will always reach a capacity cap until it can
invest in renting or buying a new venue. By contrast, MeetUp.com, a
cloud-based platform business that allows users to organize spontaneous
social gatherings anywhere in the world, has no obvious limit to its scale.
(MeetUp has 21 million members in 181 countries. As I type this, there
are nearly 4,000 meet-ups happening simultaneously around the world.)
􀁲􀀁 On-demand access and speed: Mobile computing means that every platform
now can be accessible to all of its customers anywhere at any time.
As Airbnb founder Brian Chesky has remarked, “Imagine Uber, if every
driver didn’t have a phone . . . they have a laptop. And every driver had
to drive home to check the laptop to see when a ride was available. Think
about how much friction Uber would have! In our business, if a seller has
a mobile device, it could simulate the responsive and the up-to-dateness
of a hotel. This is why mobile is transformational for our business. It
means a seller can act like a company, in the best possible way.”12
􀁲􀀁 Trust: Anonymity is great for facilitating some kinds of interactions
on the Web, but it isn’t very helpful for a platform business. The rise
64 BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS
of dominant social networks and the ability to authenticate customers
through their Facebook, Google, Twitter, or LinkedIn identities make
it much easier for even a small start-up to use a verification system for
new customers on its platform. That same trust allows for the rapid
spread of recommendations and referrals through social media distribution,
which is critical to growing a new platform business.
The biggest impact of digital technology on platforms may be in the
size of the businesses involved. Before the digital age, platform businesses
used to be mostly large enterprises—credit card companies, shopping
malls, media companies—because of the resources required to attract sufficient
numbers of participating partners. This is the downside of network
effects for platforms: it can take a lot of capital to bring parties to the table at
sufficient scale (economists dub this the chicken-and-egg problem). With
the help of the digital tools described above, the chicken-and-egg problem
is much more easily surmounted. Today, multisided platforms are no longer
the domain only of large enterprises; they are the preferred launch pad
for entrepreneurial ventures of all sizes, from large innovative companies
to the smallest but most ambitious entrepreneurs.
Competitive Benefits of Platforms
Three of the five most valuable companies in the world—Apple, Google,
and Microsoft—have built their businesses on platform business models.
The secret to their success—and that of many other companies—is that
platforms provide several powerful benefits to the companies that can build
them effectively.
Light in Assets
When Chinese e-commerce and online marketplace titan Alibaba conducted
its IPO, I was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal on the import
of what was the largest IPO ever ($25 billion raised). One of the things
I observed was Alibaba’s rise among other mega-platform businesses, each
with relatively light assets for its market valuation. As Tom Goodwin, a
senior vice president at Havas Media, commented a few months later, “Uber,
the world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world’s
most popular media owner, creates no content. Alibaba, the most valuable
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS65
retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the world’s largest accommodation
provider, owns no real estate. Something interesting is happening.”13
Because platforms give their customers the job of creating much of their
value, they tend to be light in assets. Both capital and operating costs are low at
businesses like Airbnb. These companies also tend to have few employees for
the revenue they generate because their customers do much of the work that
employees would do in a vertically integrated business. As a result, platform
businesses can achieve extremely high operating margins on a percentage basis.
Scaling Fast
Platform businesses can grow extremely quickly. Their low operating costs,
combined with a scalable cloud computing architecture, make this possible.
A line chart of Airbnb’s user growth looks like a hockey stick, with listings
shooting up 1,000 percent in three years.14 The ability of platforms to
increase revenue with relatively slow employee growth is likely another factor.
Airbnb reached $4 billion in gross bookings with only 600 employees.15
Since the rise of the Internet, the list of the fastest-growing new companies
around the world is dominated by those using platform business
models. In fact, eight of the ten most valuable global companies founded
since 1994 are platform companies (see table 3.4).16

Winner Takes All
Once a platform is widely established in its category, it is extremely hard
to launch a direct challenger with a similar service—a result of the power
of network effects. Customers would rather sign up for a platform that
already has broad acceptance or many other users. It would be very hard
for a direct competitor to catch up with Facebook (in social networking) or
Google (in search) or to launch a new credit card challenger to Visa, MasterCard,
and American Express. This defense is weaker in ad-supported
media, where network effects are only one-sided (advertisers care about the
number of readers, but readers don’t care about the number of advertisers).
But in a platform with network effects for all parties, new challengers face
a formidable barrier to entry. In most cases, this leads toward consolidation
around a few very dominant players holding the large majority of the
market (e.g., credit cards, search engines).
In certain cases, markets will tend toward a true winner-take-all
scenario where only one platform is viable. One example is the platform
war between Sony’s Blu-Ray and Toshiba’s HD DVD to become
the hardware standard for high-definition movie discs. Sony won, and
Blu-Ray became the sole standard used by Hollywood studios and DVD
players alike.
This kind of winner-take-all total consolidation is likely to happen
when three factors are present:
1. Multihoming—using more than one platform—is hard for the customer
(e.g., nobody wants to buy two DVD players, whereas carrying
two credit cards is easy).
2. Indirect network effects are strong (e.g., viewers care what format
Hollywood will release movies on, and Hollywood cares what
format viewers use).
3. Feature differentiation is low (e.g., there were never going to be major
differences in features among DVD players—product differentiation
would mostly reside in the TV sets).
This anticompetitive aspect of platforms can be alarming because it can
appear to reinforce monopoly behavior. But rather than a few monopolies
striding over a handful of very broad industries, the future seems more
likely to hold lots of (near) monopolies occupying shifting categories until
they vanish (very soon no one will care who won the DVD wars). Facebook
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS67
is extremely well protected against another challenger trying to launch an
equivalent social networking tool (even Google Plus failed at this). But
its challenge is that other platforms will establish dominant positions in
slightly different categories of social media interaction—a dominant platform
for photos or for messaging or for more ephemeral communications.
(This is why Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp and tried to buy
Snapchat.) The real threat to Google is not that another company will
develop a similar search engine (e.g., Bing) but that users and advertisers
will be drawn away to other kinds of search tools, like voice search via
Siri, product search on Amazon, or other specialized search tools for travel,
clothing, or other categories.
Economic Efficiency
One of the most striking benefits of platform business models is that they
enable the efficient usage of distributed pockets of economic value (labor,
assets, skills) that otherwise could not be effectively used.
The result is a profusion of platforms that bring together lone actors
and empower them to contribute economically. These can be microretailers
who are now able to sell their own craft products on Etsy or
their music on CD Baby or micro-resellers who can find buyers for their
used goods on eBay or Craigslist. They can be micro-donors on a platform
like DonorsChoose or Kiva or micro-patrons of the arts who find
that with just $25 they can help fund an independent documentary film
on Kickstarter. They can be micro-investors on Lending Club or Funding
Circle who are helping to finance others’ small businesses. They can be
micro-software–companies consisting of a single developer building an
app for the most popular computing platforms in the world. They can be
micro-freelancers, offering their services as a driver on Uber, a handyman
on TaskRabbit, or a spell-checker on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Or
they can be micro-renters, renting out their homes on Airbnb or cars on
RelayRides. None of these roles would be possible without platforms. The
individual actor would never have the resources to find the right matching
project, need, or customer. But by reducing the transaction costs and
aggregating a community of partners, platforms can unleash untapped
economic capacity.
This phenomenon is often mislabeled the “sharing economy.” In actual
fact, very few platforms have been established to share assets or labor free
of charge, and those that do (Freecycle, NeighborGoods, etc.) are all small.
68 BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS
The popular platforms that are commonly cited as evidence of the sharing
economy are, in fact, better described as a “rental economy” (renting assets
on Airbnb), a “resell economy” (selling used assets on eBay), or a “freelance
economy” (selling labor on Uber). The societal benefits of unlocking these
pockets of resources might be great. Uber, for example, has argued that its
services reduce the total number of vehicles on the road in crowded cities.
And Airbnb prides itself on helping homeowners better themselves as
micro-entrepreneurs. But the benefits of this economic efficiency seem to
accrue only when selling, rather than sharing, is the rule.
Competition Between Platforms
Platforms don’t compete just with traditional businesses (Uber vs. a traditional
car service). They also compete against other platforms. (Uber competes
with Lyft in the United States and with Didi Kuaidi in China; all three
are platforms.)
But how do platforms compete with each other in the same category?
Not on the same factors—features, benefits, price, location—that differentiate
traditional products and services. Instead, platforms tend to compete on
five areas of value (see table 3.5):
Table 3.5

􀁲􀀁 Network-added value: This is the most obvious way that platforms
compete. Due to network effects, the platform with the most current
customers is often the one most likely to draw future customers.
But the network of participating customers can add benefits beyond
sheer numbers. The quality of goods and services customers offer is
often important as well. (Etsy has built a platform for selling handmade
goods by nurturing a community of craftspeople making quality
goods of a kind you may not find on eBay.) The data provided by one
group of customers can also increase the ability of a platform to attract
customers of another group. (The amount of social, demographic, and
personal-interest data that users provide to Facebook is precisely the
reason the company can charge advertisers relatively high rates.)
􀁲􀀁 Platform-added value: In some cases, the value provided by the various
types of customers is not enough to make a platform competitive. The
platform itself has to develop unique features and benefits to attract
customers. Google attracts users to Android phones with its Google
Now personal assistant and the seamless integration of its popular
Maps, Calendar, and Gmail. Its competitor Apple attracts users with
its own software, like iTunes and the Siri personal assistant, and the
unique hardware design of its iPhones. For ad-supported media platforms,
the biggest area of competition is their platform-added value—
that is, the content they create to attract their audience. That content
may be subsidized or provided entirely free to the consumer, thanks to
advertiser revenue. Although a video channel or blog competes with its
peers by trying to make attractive content, its real business model is to
sell the audience to advertisers.
􀁲􀀁 Open standards: Another important way that a platform competes is by
offering more-open and easier-to-use standards than its competitors.
The rapid growth of platforms like YouTube is aided in large part by
the self-service Web or app interfaces they offer, which make it easy for
anyone to upload content or join a platform’s network. For customers
who need more technical control, platforms will use SDKs and APIs
to provide self-service access. Openness is relative, however, and never
completely absolute. Google’s Android platform is more open than
Apple’s iOS, but even Android puts restrictions on phone manufacturers
who wish to use its services like Google Maps, Calendar, and Search.
(This is why Xiaomi and others use the unrestricted, open-source version
of Android instead.) Standards offer access to outside parties, but
they also act as control points by which platform owners restrict what
70 BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS
data and functionality outside parties can and cannot access. The only
totally open platform is a public design standard. These facilitate interaction
by all sides but afford no control or monetization to a central
owner. The Internet itself is a set of such standards.
􀁲􀀁 Interaction tools: Once a platform has attracted customers and made
it easy for them to come on board, it can compete by providing them
with the best tools to find and interact with the right partners. Dating
sites like eHarmony or OKCupid compete on the algorithms and data
science they use to help men and women find the right match (rather
than scrolling through thousands of random entries). Other interaction
tools focus on enabling transactions between users. Airbnb added
an Instant Book option that allows travelers in a hurry to instantly
confirm a reservation—as they would on a hotel website—rather than
waiting for a host to reply to their inquiry. eBay provides sellers the
option to offer their products via an auction or at a fixed price. Amazon
Marketplace provides fulfillment services for its sellers (they don’t have
to mail packages to the customer like an eBay seller); it also provides
order tracking for purchasers.
􀁲􀀁 Trust enablers: The last way that platforms compete to attract customers
is by offering better methods to enable trust among the parties they
bring together. These can include identification systems, such as social
log-ins through Facebook, Google, Twitter, or LinkedIn. (Although
the early Internet thrived on anonymity, platforms thrive on identity.)
Another enabler is reputation systems, typically in the form of customer
reviews. In some platforms, reviews are mutual, but in others,
they are only one-way (customers reviews the restaurant where they
ate after making a reservation on OpenTable, but the restaurant doesn’t
review the diners). Trust can also be enabled by financial safeguards,
such as insurance to cover losses incurred by customers or mediation
of billing disputes by transaction platforms like PayPal. In other cases,
noncompetitive assurances are critical to creating trust in a platform.
Numerous manufacturers, from Samsung to Philips to Google’s Nest,
have begun developing “smart” products like lightbulbs, refrigerators,
and thermostats for the “connected home.” Consumers have been waiting
for a single interface rather than having to use a different app for
every appliance in the home. But none of the manufacturers was willing
to use its competitor’s software standard as a platform. This created
an opportunity for Wink, a start-up that provides an elegant control
interface for any device in the connected home. Because Wink does
not make its own competing appliances, it has been able to attract big
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS71
manufacturers like GE, Philips, Lutron, Honeywell, Schlage, and Nest
to connect to its platform. Sometimes the small platform can win.
Before we move on from the subject of platforms to other changes in
the landscape of competition, let’s take a look at a strategic mapping tool
that can be used to gain insights into any platform business.
Tool: The Platform Business Model Map
The Platform Business Model Map is an analytic and visualization tool
designed to identify all the critical parties in a platform and analyze where
value creation and exchange take place among the different customers and
with the platform business itself. The logic of platforms is quite different
from that of traditional product, service, or reseller businesses. It is therefore
very important that you understand the value exchange among customers
in order to see the strategy behind any successful platform.
In figure 3.1, we see how a Platform Business Model Map displays the
various components of Facebook’s business model.
Shapes indicate the key parties within the business model:
􀁲􀀁 Circle: The platform
􀁲􀀁 Diamonds: The payers (customers that provide revenue to the platform)
􀁲􀀁 Rectangle: The sweeteners (customers that provide no revenue but help
to attract other valuable customers)
􀁲􀀁 Spikes: The number of other customer types that are attracted (e.g.,
publishers have one spike because they attract only users, but users
have four spikes because they attract publishers, advertisers, app developers,
and more users like themselves)
􀁲􀀁 Double-borders: The linchpin (the customer type with the most spikes;
the king of network effects)
Arrows indicate value exchange:
􀁲􀀁 Arrows in each direction show the value provided, or received, by each
customer type.
􀁲􀀁 Value in boldface is monetary value.
􀁲􀀁 Value in parentheses is provided by the platform itself or to the platform
itself (e.g., the platform’s share of revenues).
􀁲􀀁 Value not in parentheses is passed through the platform and is provided
to other customers.
72 BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS
We can learn several things about Facebook’s business model through
this tool. Facebook brings together four types of customers on its platform:
social network users, advertisers, app developers, and news and content
publishers. The business model is a mix of two of our four types of platforms:
ad-supported media and software standard (for the app developers).
The platform is fueled by cross-side network effects (different types of customers
are attracted to each other) and also by same-side network effects
(users are attracted by more of their own kind).
What about the relative importance of different types of customers to
Facebook’s platform? The prime importance of users is clear because even
though they pay no fees to Facebook, they are the linchpin that attracts
everyone else to the platform. Advertisers, on the right, are the primary
revenue source for the business model. The role of news publishers is clarified,
too: although they provide no revenue, they add value for the linchpin

customers and hence to the platform (they get users to spend more time on
the service and therefore see more ads).
If you are launching your own platform, you can use the Platform Business
Model Map to answer these important questions:
􀁲􀀁 Whom do you need to bring on board to make your platform work?
􀁲􀀁 How will you monetize?
􀁲􀀁 Who are your most important customers? (These are likely both the
primary payer and the linchpin.)
􀁲􀀁 Is your business model in balance? Does each party receive enough
value to attract its participation? Does each party contribute enough
value to justify its inclusion?
You can also use the Platform Business Model Map to analyze other
platforms—competitors in your industry, a benchmark from another
industry, or a platform that is acting as an intermediary between you and
your customers. Analyzing another firm’s platform will help you to answer
these important questions:
􀁲􀀁 Who are the platform’s key customers?
􀁲􀀁 What is the role, or value contribution, of each customer type?
􀁲􀀁 What draws each party to the platform?
􀁲􀀁 How does the platform monetize?
􀁲􀀁 What value do you provide if you are a customer of the platform?
􀁲􀀁 How could you extract or leverage more value from the platform?

Map can be found at http://www.davidrogers.biz under Tools.
The Shifting Landscape of Competition
Platforms offer a fundamentally different model for how businesses relate
to each other—not as suppliers, distributors, and rivals but as networked
partners. But even if it does not use a platform business model, every business
faces a very different world of competition in the digital age.
In a traditional view, we think of competition as happening between
rival businesses of the same kind in the same industry. We think of collaboration
as occurring between a business and the firms that serve as its sales
74 BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS
channels and suppliers. But in the digital era, any relationship between two
businesses is a shifting mix of competition and cooperation.
This is because digital technologies are contributing to three major
shifts in the competitive landscape. First, competition with rivals is changing,
becoming less of a direct contest and zero-sum game. Second, industry
definitions and boundaries are becoming more fluid, leading to conflict
between more asymmetrical competitors. Finally, the relationships of
businesses to their channel and supply chain partners are being regularly
reshuffled and reorganized. Let’s look at all three shifts.
Co-opetition
Traditional thinking about competition is dominated by metaphors from
war and sports. The aim of business is to “win,” to “be the best,” and to
“beat” the competition. As in sports contests, our enemies are similar to
us (Ford vs. General Motors, Sony vs. Samsung), and we compete within a
clear set of rules: the boundaries of our industry. In the “business as contest”
view, competition is a zero-sum game: for one side to win, the other
side must lose. As Gore Vidal wrote, “It is not enough to succeed. Others
must fail.”
Michael Porter, perhaps the most famous management thinker on
competition, criticizes this view of “competition to be the best” and warns
that it is a path to mediocre performance. Simplistic striving for market
share (remember GE CEO Jack Welch’s famous insistence on being #1 or
#2 in every industry) leads to price wars and low profitability. Aiming to
be the generic “best” (as in the rallying cry of General Motors CEO Dan
Akerson, “May the best car win!”) obscures the importance of finding a
unique way of creating value for customers, as this presumes there is only
one way. A zero-sum view of competition sets up a race to the bottom that
no one can win.17
Real competition is far from a zero-sum contest. In many cases, effective
strategy calls for even direct competitors to find ways to work together
cooperatively in certain arenas. The term co-opetition was coined by Novell
founder Ray Noorda and popularized by Adam Brandenburger and Barry
Nalebuff in a book of the same name. The authors apply game theory to
business relationships to show why the right strategy for rival businesses is
often a mix of competition and cooperation on different fronts. For example,
peer universities will compete fiercely during the admissions process to
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS75
attract the same desirable student applicants and during the hiring process
to attract the same promising faculty. Yet, at other times, they will work
together to advance the standing and role of university education in the
broader market. In Brandenburger and Nalebuff’s view, rival companies
must cooperate to “grow the pie” at the same time that they compete with
each other to “divide the pie.”18
Digital platforms are increasingly a factor in driving strategic cooperation
among business rivals. If you examine today’s leading consumer
technology companies—Apple, Google, Facebook, Samsung, Amazon—it
is clear that they are all competing fiercely on multiple fronts. Apple’s hardware
competes with Samsung’s and Amazon’s. Apple’s operating system
competes with Google’s (which is running on Samsung phones), which
also competes with Amazon (which is running a proprietary and competitive
version of Android). Facebook is competing with all these operating
systems to be the most dominant layer of customer interaction on mobile
devices and the most valuable digital advertising platform. It is also competing
with Google’s YouTube to be the biggest platform for online video
distribution. Amazon is striving to steal search engine traffic for products
from Google and building an advertising platform of its own. Meanwhile,
Amazon is striving to stay ahead of Google and Apple as the leading source
for digital books, television shows, and movies while all three compete to
distribute downloaded and streaming music.
We could easily expect these five companies to behave like the Five
Families of organized crime at war with each other in the Godfather movies.
But, in fact, all five are deeply enmeshed with each other, cooperating and
linking their products and services. Apple devices have long run Google as
their default search engine. Facebook is the most popular app on everyone’s
mobile devices. Amazon’s media collections are available and popular on
Apple and Android devices, despite competing directly with Apple’s App
Store and Google’s Play. Samsung actually manufactures many of the critical
components for the very Apple iPhones that are competing with its own
phones. The reason for all this cooperation is clear: the power of platforms.
The power of Google in search, Amazon in media distribution, Facebook
in social networks, and Apple and Android in mobile operating systems
means that none of these businesses can afford to cut off their competitors
from their own customers.
In other cases, disruptive threats from new technologies are driving
rival businesses to team together and cooperate to defend their turf. Television
networks had already seen the impact of digital distribution and
76 BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS
digital piracy on industries like music and books when they decided to
team together to launch Hulu, an online streaming television service that
combines the latest shows from the same networks that compete as direct
rivals in traditional television distribution.
Fluid Industries and Asymmetric Competitors
Much of our thinking about competition takes the industry as the unit
of analysis. Porter’s five forces (the most famous framework for thinking
about competition) provide a model for the overall level of competition
within an industry: How intense is competition in the U.S. airline industry?
Or the Mexican cement industry? Is it increasing or decreasing? And so on.
But what happens if the definition and the boundaries of your industry are
in flux?
Today, the boundaries of industries are much less static due to rapid
technological change. When the electric car company Tesla entered the
market, it seemed to clearly fit in the automotive industry, competing
against other manufacturers of electric, gas, and hybrid vehicles, like Toyota,
BMW, and General Motors. But in order to develop its cars, Tesla has
had to focus on developing next-generation electric batteries as well as services
for charging them. In 2015, Tesla announced that it might begin offering
these same batteries for electric power storage in consumers’ homes.
If successful and if combined with home solar panels, these could become
a challenger to traditional electric utilities in the home.19 So is Tesla a car
company or an electric battery company? We don’t know yet.
Meanwhile, Alphabet (Google’s parent company) is one of the leading
companies developing software for self-driving cars, drawing on its
strengths in massive data computation. When these cars become commercially
viable, the company that is most known for its search engine might
become one of the dominant players in an auto industry that is becoming
as focused on data and artificial intelligence as it is on engines and chassis
design. As digital sensors and connectivity become embedded in more and
more objects (cars, tractors, jet engines, home appliances), the Internet of
Things is likely to redefine the boundaries of many industries that were less
transformed by the Internet than were media and information businesses.
Companies can expect to compete with more and more businesses that
do not look much like them. We can think of this as a shift from symmetric
to asymmetric competitors.
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS77
Symmetric competitors offer similar value propositions to customers.
BMW and Mercedes-Benz have different brands and appeal to different
drivers, but their offerings are broadly similar: ownership or lease of
a private vehicle with many of the same features. Symmetric competitors
also deliver that value with similar business models. One carmaker may be
larger or smaller, with different economies of scale or other factors, but the
broad model is the same—manufacturing plants, dealerships, pricing for
sale and lease.
Asymmetric competitors are quite different. They offer similar value
propositions to customers, but their business models are not the same.
For an automaker like BMW, an asymmetric competitor might include
a ride-sharing service like Uber—if customers buy fewer cars because
Uber can fulfill their transit needs. (For many American teenagers, signing
up for an Uber rider’s account may replace getting a driver’s license
as the rite of passage upon turning 16 years old.20) If an electric utility’s
symmetric competitors are other companies providing energy to homes
from the power grid, its asymmetric competitor could be a partnership
between Tesla’s home batteries unit and a solar panel company, which
together could enable homeowners to unplug from the grid completely.
If HBO’s symmetric competitors are Showtime and AMC (offering programs
to consumers through the same cable bundles), then its asymmetric
competitors would include Hulu and Netflix, which provide viewing
options and original content through digital devices and outside of the
cable intermediary.
Rita McGrath advises thinking about competition less in terms of
industries and more in terms of arenas—companies that have a similar
offer, for the same market segment, in the same geographic location.21 Russell
Dubner, U.S. CEO of Edelman, the world’s largest independently owned
PR firm, thinks a lot about asymmetrical competitors, or “substitutes,” as he
calls them. “We always look at substitutes—how else can our client spend
their money to achieve that same goal? If you just look at direct competition,
someone can eat your lunch and you’ll never see them coming.”22
Disintermediation and Intermediation
One of the biggest impacts of digital technologies has been on the relationships
of businesses to the partners in their supply chain—the companies
that supply critical inputs for the primary businesses’ own products or that
78 BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS
create additional value and distribute or sell those products to their eventual
consumers.
This disruption and reconfiguration of business relationships is mostly
talked about in terms of disintermediation—the removal of an intermediary
or middleman from a series of business transactions. The Internet is widely
known to have been a powerful force for disintermediation, as it has made
it much easier for goods and services of all kinds to reach any audience that
wants them.
Newspapers were disintermediated by classified websites like Craigslist
or Monster.com. Individual advertisers were able to skip the middleman
(an expensive print ad in the local newspaper) and reach the desired
audience directly by posting a cheap or free ad on one of these popular
websites. Retail bookstore chains like Barnes & Noble and Borders Books
were disintermediated by the arrival of Amazon.com, which for the first
time offered publishers another path by which to sell books to consumers
(Borders eventually filed for bankruptcy). In these cases, a new, digital-first
challenger arrived to act as intermediary, letting the supplier sidestep its
traditional channel for reaching customers.
In other cases, companies trying to reach their ultimate consumers
may build their own digital channel to sidestep, or disintermediate, their
traditional partners. The insurance industry in many countries was built
on an agency model, in which insurers sold their policies to individuals
through independent agents. This reduced the employee overhead for
the insurance companies but put a barrier between them and the users of
their products, which inevitably reduces how much they know about those
consumers and how effectively they can market to them. Insurance companies
are extremely beholden to the intermediary, their agents, and this
dependency hampers them in many markets when responding to consumers’
increasing desire for self-service and online shopping and purchasing
options. Newer insurance companies, such as Geico (owned by Berkshire
Hathaway), have entered the market that are selling directly to consumers
online. Allstate Insurance has maintained its insurance agents while at
the same time acquiring Esurance, which sells directly to consumers like
Geico does. Allstate is, in essence, maintaining and disintermediating its
sales partners at the same time.
Digital platforms are also fueling a reverse phenomenon, which is
best described as intermediation. In these cases, a new business manages
to insert itself as an intermediary between the customers and a company
that used to sell directly to them. Intermediation happens when a platform
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS79
builds such a large customer base and becomes such a valuable interface to
customers that other businesses cannot afford to skip the opportunity to
reach customers through that platform. The benefit to the new intermediary
is that it inevitably extracts a toll or platform benefit, often capturing a
great deal of value.
Facebook, for example, has managed to insert itself as an intermediary
between news readers and news publications that previously reached
them directly, whether through printed editions or their own websites
and apps. With social media driving over 30 percent of all traffic to publisher
websites and Facebook delivering 75 percent of that social traffic,
no publisher, from BuzzFeed to The New York Times Company, can
afford to skip using Facebook as a means to promote its content.23 That
gives increasing leverage to Facebook, which is able to greatly influence
the prominence and visibility of publishers’ articles in the News Feed of
its users. (In fact, Facebook became such a huge driver of publisher traffic
only after reconfiguring its algorithm in December 2013 to give more
priority to news stories.) As Facebook’s leverage over publishers grows, it
is expected to extract a share of the advertising revenue from the readers
it delivers to news publishers.24
The same phenomenon of intermediation can be seen with other
increasingly powerful platforms. Apple Pay, the mobile payment system for
iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches, was able to enlist Visa and Master-
Card as partners for its launch, despite the fact that Apple Pay is inserting
itself as an intermediary between these credit card companies and their
own cardholder customers. Apple’s huge and affluent customer base and its
track record in designing digital interfaces that customers use make it too
powerful to ignore in the growing mobile payments sector. When a consortium
of 200 German publishers complained that Google was stealing value
from them by including their articles in its search results, Google decided
to simply exclude them from its searches. When they experienced a loss of
traffic that they said could cause member publishers to go bankrupt, the
consortium reversed course and asked Google to put their articles back in
its search results.25
Tool: The Competitive Value Train
As the locus of competition expands from rivalries among similar firms
to include asymmetric competitors and a firm’s own suppliers and
80 BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS
intermediaries, managers need new ways of visualizing their competitive
landscape. The Competitive Value Train is a tool I designed to analyze competition
and leverage between a firm and its business partners, direct rivals,
and asymmetric competitors.
Let’s avoid any confusion with two related terms. Porter’s value chain
is a popular tool for examining the various processes that add value to a
product or service within a company’s own operations (e.g., how the R&D,
manufacturing, marketing, and sales departments each add value). The
supply chain is a widely used tool for modeling the processes across different
companies that contribute to a product’s manufacture, distribution, and
sale. Both these tools focus on operational design.
By contrast, the value train focuses on competition by looking at the
leverage between the companies in a supply chain and their potential substitutes
and by mapping how a particular product or service reaches a particular
group of customers. For a business with many products, suppliers,
sales channels, and types of customers, a single value train will show only
one thread of its complete operations or business model. But this will allow
managers to focus on the competitive and cooperative forces at work in
delivering that particular stream of value.
A competitive value train starts with a horizontal train of firms leading
to a final consumer on the right. The number of firms drawn will depend on
your business model and means of distribution. Following are three broad
types commonly seen as you move upstream from the final consumer:
􀁲􀀁 Distributor: Delivers the product or service to the consumer, although
it may not manufacture the product or service (e.g., a retailer like
Walmart or an e-tailer like Amazon)
􀁲􀀁 Producer: Creates the finished product, service, or offering paid for
by the consumer (e.g., an insurance company, record label, book publisher,
or laptop manufacturer)
􀁲􀀁 Originator: Creates unique elements or parts of the offering (e.g., a
manufacturer producing operating systems or chips for laptops or a
musician creating recordings for a record label)
Figure 3.2 presents an example of a simple value train with these three kinds
of businesses.
The next element to add to a value train is competitors. Below each
business, or “car,” in the train, we indicate its symmetric competitors. Above
the same car, we indicate any asymmetric competitors.
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS81
Figure 3.3 represents a competitive value train for books sold through
a retailer like Barnes & Noble. The books originate with the author (conceiving
and writing the manuscript), who is contracted by the publisher
(providing financing, marketing, distribution, and editorial services),
and then are sold through a book retailer to the ultimate consumer, the
reader. The competitive leverage of Barnes & Noble is shaped by the relative
strengths of other physical retail chains and the dominant e-tailer,
Amazon.
Understanding Competition as Leverage
By depicting both partners and their symmetric and asymmetric competitors,
the value train aims to provide a multidimensional view of competition
and cooperation.
Think of the newspaper industry. The Washington Post and the New
York Times newspapers are clearly symmetric competitors—they provide
similar value to overlapping readers. However, the biggest competitive
threats to each newspaper may lie elsewhere.

As we have already seen, as Facebook inserts itself between the newspapers
and their readers, it is gaining competitive power as an intermediary
(figure 3.4a). At the same time, classified websites have disintermediated
the newspapers in the path from advertisers to readers (figure 3.4b). Lastly,
these newspapers may face a threat from the reporters who write their
articles (figure 3.4c). In the digital age, star journalists are able to cultivate
brand visibility directly with their audience, particularly with the use of
social media. Writer Ezra Klein quickly developed such a huge following
as a political policy blogger at the Washington Post that the editors were
reportedly loathe to critique his columns. Although the leadership of the
paper supported Klein and tried to keep him on as a star employee, he
eventually left to serve as founding editor-in-chief at a new digital-first
news venture, Vox.com. The same process has been seen with several
other star journalists in traditional media companies.

Value Train Analysis of Three Competitive Threats to Newspapers.
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS83
The value train can be used to examine all three of these competitive
dynamics for newspapers and the critical questions in each case: Who has
leverage in the relationships in the value train? Where is disintermediation
happening or possible? Where is intermediation happening? Looked
at through the lens of the value train, it becomes clear that the goal for any
business is not simply to defeat, or even outperform, its direct competitors
(e.g., the Washington Post vs. the New York Times). The overriding competitive
goal is to gain more leverage in its value train.
Two Rules of Power in Value Trains
More generally, we can identify two broad principles that determine who
tends to gain power within value trains.
PRINCIPLE 1: POWER TO THE UNIQUE VALUE CREATOR
At every stage in the value train, each business needs to create unique value
in order to exert competitive leverage on its partners upstream (to the left)
and downstream (to the right). The more a business is able to distinguish
itself from both symmetric and asymmetric competitors at its own stage
in the value train, the more bargaining power it will maintain with its own
partners and customers. All news publishers are losing influence to Facebook,
but those whose products are more of a commodity have much less
leverage than a publisher like The New York Times Company, which has
continued to maintain a differentiated brand in the eyes of readers. Similarly,
most reporters do not have the differentiated value to be able to disintermediate
their own publication. It is the unique value of a writer like Ezra
Klein (in the eyes of his readers) that gives him leverage over his publishers.
Unique value can come from a variety of sources: intellectual property,
brand equity, network effects, anything that creates additional value for the
final customer in the value train.
PRINCIPLE 2: POWER TO THE ENDS
As industry redefinition leads to more asymmetric competitors, power in
value trains is moving to the ends, where there is less opportunity to be
skipped over by business partners. In a value train, the first creator and the
84 BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS
final distributor to the end consumer each have additional influence by virtue
of their positions. By contrast, the parties in the middle tend to be boxed
in and lose influence relative to the creators and end distributors. Examples
of original creators who gain more leverage are star journalists and brands
manufacturing in-demand products (on the left side of the value train).
Examples of strong final distributors are Walmart in physical retailing and
Facebook as a media distribution layer (at the right side of the value train).
This power imbalance was described in manufacturing by Acer founder
Stan Shih’s “smiling curve”: profits are inevitably captured by the companies
that originate key patents and those that brand and distribute products,
but the fabricators and manufacturers in between them languish in a valley
of low leverage and profitability.26 Almost all digital platforms—whether
Airbnb, Facebook, Google, or Apple Pay—seek to secure a position as the
final interface to the end consumer because of the competitive leverage that
it confers.
Applying the Competitive Value Train
You can use the tool to predict and assess possible moves by partners, competitors,
and new entrants in your value train. You can also use it to analyze
possible competitive moves that you are considering. It is particularly useful
for understanding the dynamics of disintermediation and intermediation
as well as any shifts in the relationships between your firm and its sales
channels or its suppliers or both. This can include a business leapfrogging
over its current partners—for example, launching a direct-to-consumer
business to become its own distributor.
Figure 3.5 shows value train analyses of two examples seen earlier in
the chapter. The first shows HBO’s decision to launch a direct online service
for viewers (branded HBO Now), despite the continued importance
of cable companies as HBO’s distributors to most consumers. The second
depicts Allstate’s acquisition of Esurance, an asymmetric competitor of its
own affiliated insurance agents, while continuing to sell through the agents
under the Allstate corporate brand name.
You can analyze other plans for intermediation, disintermediation, or
channel substitution similarly in order to forecast their potential impact on
competition and cooperation between firms.

Organizational Challenges of Competition
As businesses adapt to the growing importance of platforms and the shifting
landscape of competition and cooperation between firms, many of the
challenges that arise are not just strategic challenges but also organizational
ones.
Shifting Roles Midstream
Reshuffling the roles and relationships of a company’s value train can be
difficult for an enterprise that has a long-standing business model and
relationships with both upstream suppliers and downstream distributors.
Channel conflict is the common term for the situation where a business is
balancing both working with a key sales channel and going around it. Shifting
channel strategies is particularly difficult for a business because of its
vested interest in existing channels and the risk of cannibalizing its current
sales in pursuit of a new opportunity.
The trade-offs are quite real. When e-commerce first offered the
promise of selling directly to consumers, many brands embarked on plans

to set up their own online stores. Most failed due to lack of sufficient
demand (consumers didn’t want to go to a different website to replace
each item in their wardrobe or cabinet), lack of technical capability (to
create a great online shopping experience), or both. Levi Strauss shifted
course after spending millions of dollars on its e-commerce plans and
chose to partner with traditional retailers like Macy’s that were building
online stores selling multiple brands.27 Only later did Levi Strauss
return to launch its own online channel. Other companies, like furniture
maker Ethan Allen, have opted to use their offline sales partners to
support order fulfillment for products sold directly to consumers. This
allows them to establish an online channel but keep their existing offline
partners invested.
When companies do launch a direct-to-consumer channel in competition
with their primary sales channel, they need to establish clear boundaries.
These may be geographic boundaries: some insurance companies that
rely on sales agents have initiated their first direct-to-consumer sales in
geographic markets where they are not well established. Another kind of
boundary can be provided by branding: when Allstate purchased Esurance,
it opted to run the direct-to-consumer business as an independent unit
under a different brand.
Warfare Mentality
Both co-opetition and the search for leverage in value trains require leaders
to look at competition as more than a zero-sum contest.
In organizations where the “competition is war” metaphor and mindset
run deep, cooperating with rivals and competing with partners can
pose a cultural challenge. When Doreen Lorenzo, former president of Frog
Design, first took the helm of that company, a peer gave her a book: Sun
Tzu’s The Art of War. “I don’t want to sound like a baby boomer,” Doreen
told me, “but sometimes, war is not the answer. Or not the only answer.”
Sun Tzu is not alone. Among the many bellicose management guides
published are books such as Wess Roberts’s Leadership Secrets of Attila the
Hun. That scorched-earth conqueror is famed for quotes such as “There,
where I have passed, the grass will never grow again.”
There are certainly times for fierce competition with rivals. But to
succeed in the dynamic ecosystem of business today, leaders need to
BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS87
know when to fight and when to make peace. The creators of PayPal certainly
learned this. They actually started out as the leaders of two bitterly
competing start-ups, Confinity and X.com, with mirror-image products.
“By late 1999, we were in all-out war,” writes Peter Thiel, who goes on to
describe 100-hour workweeks gripped by a mania of competition. “No
doubt that was counterproductive, but the focus wasn’t on objective productivity;
the focus was defeating X.com. One of our engineers actually
designed a bomb for this purpose. . . . Calmer heads prevailed.” Finally, in
2000, faced with a rapidly deflating tech bubble, the founders of the two
companies met on neutral ground and negotiated a 50–50 merger. “Deescalating
the rivalry post-merger wasn’t easy, but . . . as a unified team,
we were able to ride out the dot-com crash and then build a successful
business.”28
Openness
One of the biggest challenges of a platform business model is letting go
of some of the value creation process. By their nature, platforms grow by
letting their distinct outside parties each bring their own value to the platform
and interact with a substantial degree of independence. This requires
a hands-off approach that may not be possible for some leaders or some
company cultures.
The most valuable platform business in the world struggled mightily
with this. Apple and its founder, Steve Jobs, had always distinguished themselves
with an exacting focus on controlling every aspect of the customer
experience for products like Macintosh computers, iPod music players,
and the iTunes music store. Their seamless integration seemed to hinge on
Apple’s maintaining absolute and total control.
When the iPhone first launched, the company followed this same
philosophy: everything was designed and built by Apple. In its first year,
users immediately recognized the power of the computer sitting behind
the iPhone’s glowing touchscreen, and hackers began “jailbreaking” their
phones so they could experiment and add new programs of their own
design. Apple was faced with a decision: fight back against the hackers
(who were, in fact, Apple’s early adopters and avid customers) or shift
course and provide tools for outside developers to program directly for the
iPhone. Jobs’s uncharacteristic reversal led to the release of the software
88 BUILD PLATFORMS, NOT J U ST PRODUCTS
development kit that launched the App Store. This move sparked incredible
innovation, turned the iPhone into a platform business, and led Apple’s
growth into the most valuable public company in the world.
For leaders navigating today’s shifting landscape of competition, knowing
how open or closed to keep their business model is critical.
8
To operate successfully in the digital age, businesses must have a dynamic
understanding of how firms compete and cooperate. Rather than a simplistic
view of bitter enemies and unalloyed partnerships, businesses need
to see all their interfirm relationships as a shifting mix of competition and
cooperation. They must understand the value of cooperating with direct
rivals, the threat of asymmetric competitors who look nothing like them,
the importance of leverage within their relationships with partner businesses,
and the power of digitally enabled platform business models to
bring together different parties and drive new value creation.
Relationships with other firms, in short, have become just as networked
and interconnected as relationships with customers. In both relationships,
the increasing digitization of interactions is yielding another product as
well: data. Every interaction with customers or with businesses is producing
streams of information that can now be recorded, captured, and analyzed
in ways that were impossible only a short while ago. Understanding
how to utilize this data strategically, as a source of new value for businesses,
is the next important domain of digital transformation.
4
Turn Data Into Assets
The role of data for businesses is changing dramatically today. Many companies
that have used data as a specific part of their operations for years are
now discovering a data revolution: data is coming from new sources, being
applied to new problems, and becoming a key driver of innovation.
One innovator is The Weather Company (TWC). This media company
started in 1980 with a television channel, The Weather Channel. Since then,
it has branched out into third-party publishing platforms, websites, and
mobile apps, including the one I use every morning to decide whether to
pack an umbrella. Like most media companies, TWC is in the business of
making content that draws an audience and selling ads that are placed in
that content. Data has always been part of that business model: every day
vast quantities of weather data need to be captured, analyzed, and turned
into the colorful charts, animated graphics, and reliable forecasts that keep
audiences tuning in.
But TWC has discovered that its data can be much more than just
the raw material it uses to create programming for its viewers. The same
DATA
90 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
data that the firm collects, manages, and analyzes constitutes a key strategic
asset and, increasingly, a source of new innovation and value creation.
I learned about this in detail from Vikram Somaya, who was the general
manager of WeatherFX (later renamed WSI), a new TWC division
focused on thinking differently about weather data. Somaya was an art history
major in college and is fond of quoting Shakespeare, but at TWC, he
led the teams of data scientists who analyze the company’s data to generate
additional value for both business customers and end consumers.
Weather has a powerful impact on a wide range of businesses. By one
estimate, up to one-third of the U.S. economy is shaped by variations in
weather.1 Walmart has said that local weather is one of the biggest factors in
its predictive models for store sales. TWC’s data scientists work with major
retailers to identify when they should predict a spike or slump in their sales
so they can adjust their advertising spend (to commit more resources or to
hold them back) as well as their merchandising.
The company also works directly with brand advertisers—in categories
like allergy medication, fleece jackets, and snow tires—to predict the best
time for them to spend on ad placements. Even our snack food purchases
on a given day (nacho chips or pretzels?) have been found to be shaped
by whether the weather feels bright, sticky, or gloomy. With digital advertisements
(inserted on websites or in apps like TWC’s own), brands now
have the opportunity to adjust and target their message on the fly, choosing
which image to show specific viewers based on the weather where they
are standing.2
TWC is even using its data to create new products and services for
industries like the insurance sector. For instance, it has built an app called
Hailzone for insurers like State Farm and Travelers to offer their auto insurance
customers. Whenever a hailstorm is about to hit, Hailzone sends out
a text message alert to those customers, warning them to move their cars
inside. That saves a tremendous headache for the drivers and costly hail
damage bills for the insurer.
The company is even collaborating with some of its most avid customers
to grow and improve its data asset. Every day TWC crowdsources
data from a community of 25,000 self-described “weather junkies” who
pay to subscribe to a service called The Weather Underground. These avid
hobbyists spend hundreds of dollars to buy their own weather-monitoring
equipment, which they set up on their own property. Findings are shared
and discussed among the network of fellow enthusiasts. With typical
members uploading weather measurements at their own locations every
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS91
2.5 seconds, their input helps the company greatly improve the quality of
its own data sets.
TWC has evolved from a media company that simply produces data as
part of running its core operations to a company that is treating data as a
source of innovation, new revenue, and strategic advantage.
Rethinking Data
The third domain of the digital transformation playbook is data. Growing
a business in the digital age requires changing some fundamental assumptions
about data’s meaning and importance (see table 4.1). In the past,
although data played a role in every business, it was mainly used for measuring
and managing business processes and assisting in forecasting and
long-term planning. Data was expensive to produce through structured
research, surveys, and measurements. It was expensive to store in separate
databases that mimicked silos of business operations. And it was used primarily
to optimize existing operations.
Today, the role and possibilities for data are seemingly limitless. Generating
data is often the easiest part, with great quantities continuously
created by sources outside the firm. The greater challenge is harnessing
this data and turning it into useful insights. Traditional analytics based on
spreadsheets have given way to big data, where unstructured information
joins with powerful new computational tools. But for data to become a real
source of value, businesses need to change the way they think about data.
They need to treat it as a key strategic asset.

92 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
This chapter explores how the role of data is changing in business and
what leadership challenges this poses. We will examine the value of data as
an asset, the components of an effective data strategy, and the power and
misconceptions of the big-data revolution. We will see where businesses
are finding the data they need and how they are turning it into new sources
of value. This chapter also presents a strategic ideation tool, the Data Value
Generator. This tool allows businesses to use customer data to create new
value in specific areas of their operations.
But, first, let’s look at what it means to manage and invest in data as an
intangible business asset.
Data as Intangible Asset
For many of the digital titans of today’s business world, it seems clear that
the data they capture regarding their customers is one of their most valuable
assets. Much of Facebook’s market capitalization is rooted in the value
of the rich data it collects on users and in its ability to harness that data
with innovative tools for advertisers, helping them understand and reach
precisely the right audience.
But other kinds of data can be valuable as well. In building its Maps service,
Google has invested heavily for years in developing a best-in-class set
of cartographic data. This includes sending camera-equipped cars around
the world to measure out every road and capture its photographic Street
View (more recently, it has sent cameras by camelback to map the deserts of
Arabia). The company is constantly updating and “hand-cleaning” its data
with teams of human data wranglers. It tracks up to 400 data points per
road segment (the stretch of asphalt between two intersections). Depending
on the pace of economic development, that road data needs to be updated
with daunting regularity.3
On the other hand, we saw Apple’s failure to invest sufficiently in mapping
data—which led to a famous competitive fumble in 2012. As part of its
ongoing rivalry with search giant Google, Apple chose to remove Google
Maps as the default mapping app on all iPhones. Instead, it gave iPhone
customers its own new Maps app, running on data Apple had purchased
from various third parties. True to form, the Cupertino company had
designed a stunning user interface for its app. But it had underestimated the
quality of Google’s data asset. Millions of iPhone users who were forced to
use the new maps flooded Apple with complaints. Cities were misspelled or
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS93
erased, tourist attractions were misplaced, famous buildings disappeared,
and roads literally vanished into thin air. The errors were so bad that they
compelled the first letter of apology by an Apple CEO to customers. In it,
Tim Cook went so far as to advise customers to download and use competitor
apps from the App Store until Apple’s own maps improved.
Data is valuable not just for companies like Google and Facebook. For
any business today, data—like intellectual property, patents, or a brand—is
a key intangible asset. The relative importance of that asset will vary somewhat
based on the nature of the business (just as brands have greater importance
to a fashion company than an industrial manufacturer). But data is an
important asset to every business today—and neglected at our peril.
One of the most common ways that businesses can build an asset out
of customer data is through loyalty programs. For years, retailers and airlines
have offered loyalty miles, points, rewards, or a tenth sandwich free
in hopes of increasing customer retention and total spending over time.
But, today, much of the value of loyalty programs is in the accumulated
customer data that they generate. When I sign up for your loyalty program,
I am explicitly asking you to track my shopping behavior in order to earn
rewards. That gives your business much more than an address for direct
mail; your data about me grows over time to help you better understand
my unique behaviors and interests as a customer.
By designing new customer experiences with data in mind, companies
can extend this model of providing customer benefits in return for
customer data gained. Take Walt Disney Parks and Resorts and its new
MagicBand wristbands. Promoted as a way to bring the convenience of
smartphones in to the traditional theme park experience, these colorful
rubber bracelets (outfitted with RFID tags) allow guests to enter the park,
unlock their hotel room, purchase meals and merchandise, and skip the
wait on up to three rides per day. The MagicBand is the heart of a $1 billion
initiative to bring digital interactivity to Disney theme parks, and it aims
to earn that money back by increasing the “share of wallet” that visitors
spend at Disney. But it is also designed to provide Disney with previously
inaccessible data on the behaviors of its guests: Where do they go when?
Which rides are popular with which types of guests? Which foods might
be better moved to different areas of the sprawling park? The MagicBands
even allow guests to opt to be identifiable to Disney staff so that a child can
be greeted by name by costumed characters or offered a birthday wish by
a talking animatronic animal on a ride. These and other types of personalized
service experiences will become available as Disney builds more data
94 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
around its visitors on both the large scale and the individual level. The trick
is in crafting the right experience so that, just as with a loyalty program,
customers willingly exchange their data for added value from the business.
You don’t have to be a company as large as Disney or Google to start
building your data asset. Even small businesses can now use Web-based
customer relationship management tools to keep track of who opened
which e-mails, tailor follow-up messages, analyze which offers are the best
fit for which customers, and more. As we will see in our discussion of big
data, the shift to cloud computing is putting ever more powerful data management
tools into the hands of small and mid-sized businesses.
Every Business Needs a Data Strategy
Once you start to treat data as an asset, you need to develop a data strategy
in your organization. That includes understanding what data you need as
well as how you will apply it.
An explicit data strategy may seem obvious in industries like financial
services and telecommunications, which are accustomed to copious
amounts of customer data. But smaller firms and those in less data-rich
industries must also develop forward-looking strategies for their data.
The following five principles should guide any organization in developing
its data strategy.
􀁲􀀁 Gather diverse data types: Every business should look at its data asset
holistically and include diverse types of data that serve different purposes
(see table 4.2). Business process data—such as data on your supply
chain, internal billing, and human resources management—is used
to manage and optimize business operations, reduce risk, and comply
with reporting requirements. Product or service data is data that
is essential to the core value of your products or services. Examples
include weather data for TWC, cartographic data for Google Maps,
and the kind of business data that Bloomberg provides to business customers.
Customer data ranges widely—from transaction data, to customer
surveys, to reviews and comments in social media, to customer
search behavior and browsing patterns on your website. Companies
that do not sell directly to consumers (e.g., packaged goods companies)
traditionally could gather customer data only through market
research. As we will see later, even these businesses are discovering
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS95
new opportunities to piece together data to get a much clearer picture
of their customers than was possible before.
􀁲􀀁 Use data as a predictive layer in decision making: The worst thing that
companies can do with data is gather it and not apply it when making
decisions. You need to plan how your organization will utilize its
data to make better-informed decisions in all aspects of its business.
Operations data can be used in statistical modeling to plan for and
optimize the use of your resources. Customer data can be used to
predict which changes in your services or communications may yield
improved results. With detailed data from its MagicBands, Disney can
make better-informed decisions on which merchandise to feature near
different rides and how to manage variable demand and foot traffic.
Amazon uses your past browsing behavior to determine which products
it should show you in your next visit.
􀁲􀀁 Apply data to new product innovation: Data can power your existing
products or services, but it can also be used as a springboard for imagining
and testing new product innovations. TWC’s Hailzone mobile
app is a perfect case of a company using its existing product data
(for its TV shows and apps) to build a new service that added value
for multiple customers (insurance companies and their insureds). It
helped that TWC was able to step outside its normal perspective as a
media company and think about different business models based on

things like utility and risk management rather than just viewer eyeballs
and advertising. Netflix uses its vast amounts of data on viewer
preferences—for genres, actors, directors, and more—to help it craft
new television series like House of Cards. This practice lets Netflix circumvent
the traditional network TV practice of investing in pilots for
numerous new shows in hopes that one or more will pan out. That’s
using data to innovate more quickly and cheaply.
􀁲􀀁 Watch what customers do, not what they say: Behavioral data is anything
that directly measures actions of your customers. It can include
things like transactions, online searches (a powerful measure of your
customers’ intentions), clickstream data (which pages they visited,
where they clicked, and what they left in their shopping carts), and
direct measures of engagement data (which articles in your newsletter
they clicked to read). Behavioral data is always the best customer
data—it is much more valuable than reported opinions or anything
customers tell a market researcher in a survey. That is not just because
people lie in surveys but also because, as humans, we are extremely
fallible at remembering our behavior, predicting our future actions,
or considering our motivations. This is why Netflix shifted its recommendation
system from customers’ own rankings to behavioral data
as soon as it moved customers from DVDs to streaming video, which
made it possible to measure what we actually watch rather than the
unopened red envelopes on our dresser. Netflix knows that there are
big differences between the movies that we give a five-star ranking and
those that we actually wind up watching while doing the dishes on a
Wednesday night.
􀁲􀀁 Combine data across silos: Traditionally, businesses have allowed their
data to be generated and reside in separate divisions or departments.
One of the most important aspects of data strategy is to look for ways to
combine your previously separate sets of data and see how they relate
to each other. A memorable example of the benefits of combining data
sets comes from municipal government here in New York City. Scott
Stringer, the city’s comptroller (CFO), was seeking to reduce the costs
of lawsuits against the city. He launched an initiative to compare the
data on lawsuits and damages paid with other city data sets, including
the budgets of different departments over time. A surprising correlation
was discovered: after the city’s parks budget had been slashed a
few years earlier and its seasonal tree pruning reduced, legal claims
from citizens injured by falling tree limbs skyrocketed. The cost to the
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS97
city from a single lawsuit was greater than the entire tree pruning budget
for three years! Once this was discovered and the budget funding
was restored, lawsuits dropped dramatically.4 As your business environment
becomes increasingly complex, your ability to find, combine,
and learn from diverse sources of data will become more important
than ever.
In putting together a data strategy, it is also important to understand
that many of today’s data sets are very different from the spreadsheets and
relational databases that drove the best practices of data-intensive industries
in the pre-digital era. The entire nature of available data, and how it
can be applied and used by business, has undergone a revolution in recent
years. That revolution is commonly termed big data.
The Impact of Big Data
The term big data first appeared in the mid-1990s, introduced in tech circles
by John Mashey, chief scientist of Silicon Graphics, around the time of the
birth of the World Wide Web.5 But the phrase entered the broader business
conversation around 2010 as businesses of all kinds began to grapple
with the vast supply of data generated by digital technologies. At first, the
term seemed a bit faddish, a marketing ploy used by data storage firms
to get IT departments to increase their spending on data servers. But the
real changes at work have been much more profound than the size of hard
drives or server farms.
Make no mistake: the size of data sets is increasing rapidly. Every graph
representing the amount of digital data stored worldwide each year shows
the skyward leap of an exponential curve. These curves all recede exponentially
into the past as well. The sheer amount of recorded data, in other
words, has been growing for a long time—likely since the origin of computers,
maybe since the origin of writing.
So what is new about big data if not the rapidly growing “bigness” of it?
The phenomenon of big data is best understood in terms of two interrelated
trends: the rapid growth of new types of unstructured data and the
rapid development of new capabilities for managing and making sense of
this kind of data for the first time. The impact of these two is shaped by a
third trend: the rise of cloud computing infrastructure, which makes the
potential of big data increasingly accessible to more and more businesses.
98 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
Big Data Is Really Unstructured Data
Traditionally, a firm’s data processes were based on analyzing structured
data—the kind of data sets that fill a database with neatly organized rows
and columns (e.g., with addresses of customers, inventories of products, or
expenses and debits of various financial accounts).
But the big-data era has been marked by the profusion of new types
of unstructured data—information that is recorded but doesn’t fit easily
into neat forms. A business may have access to the ungrammatical text
posts of social media, the flood of smartphone-generated images, real-time
mapping and location signals, or the data from sensors rapidly spreading
over our bodies and our entire world; all these types of data are rich in
meaning—but difficult to parse by familiar tools like spreadsheets.
One of the biggest sources of unstructured data is social media. As over
a billion users worldwide participate in networks like Facebook, Twitter,
and Weibo, they are constantly producing vast amounts of data in the form
of their posts, comments, and updates. This social data is attitudinal (what
people are saying can capture their opinions, likes, and dislikes) and can be
used to measure affinity (whom they friend, follow, or link to reflects social
ties and allows businesses to infer relationships between them and others
in their network). And this data is real-time and continuous, allowing
businesses to analyze shifts in opinion, sentiment, and conversation with
precise longitudinal detail. Because of this, numerous organizations have
sought to gain insight from the analysis of social data. Brands monitor their
reputation over time based on what customers are saying, the Centers for
Disease Control uses social media to help track the spread of flu and influenza,
Hollywood predicts the opening weekend performance of new movies
based on the social “chatter” after opening night, and economists have
even used social media to effectively predict stock market performance.
Another new kind of unstructured data is location data. The data being
generated by mobile devices like smartphones comes with geolocation
markers, which provide a continuous record of where we are and where
we’re going in real time. The inclusion of location data with other kinds of
behavioral data adds tremendous additional context. Increasingly, search
engine results are shaped not just by the words we are using in our search
but also by where we are when we search. (If we Google the word pizza, we
are likely to be shown the closest establishments, with links to their phone
numbers and addresses, instead of pizza history or recipes.) Research by
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS99
my colleague Miklos Sarvary has shown that the patterns of where we go at
various times of the week (as measured by our phones) reveal a great deal
about who we are. By analyzing these “co-location” patterns, Sarvary and
his coauthors were able to show that customers with similar location “footprints”
were likely to buy similar products and could be effectively targeted
for marketing based on that data alone.6
The biggest emerging source of unstructured data is the sensors that are
becoming embedded in everything around us as we shift to a world of truly
ubiquitous networks. By 2020, Cisco expects that over 50 billion devices
will be connected and sharing information over the Internet—and the
vast majority of these devices will not be computers, smartphones, or Web
servers. This phenomenon, known as the Internet of Things, encompasses
smart automobiles, factories and product supply chains, and lightbulbs and
home appliances as well as sensors embedded in the watches and clothing
we wear and in the medicines we ingest. Together, all of these applications
will soon result in billions of devices transmitting and generating new sets
of data that can be put to business use. For example, GE has installed sensors
on its jet engines that allow the engines to continuously post updates
on their status and operating details. (GE calls the system “Facebook for jet
engines.”) This real-time data lets airline mechanics monitor the status of
critical aircraft equipment so they can make repairs when they actually are
needed rather than on a schedule of estimated need. This makes fleet maintenance
more efficient and makes air travel cheaper and more convenient.
New Tools to Wrestle Unstructured Data
The second trend shaping big data is the rise of new technological capabilities
for handling and making sense of all this unstructured data. If not for
this, big data would be simply a giant haystack in which the needle of business
insight might well be invisible. Fortunately, a range of technological
developments is expanding our abilities to use the unstructured data that
technology is producing.
The continuing exponential growth of computer processing power is a
big factor in our improved ability to use data. Moore’s law, coined by Intel
cofounder Gordon Moore in 1965, predicts a doubling in the performance
of computer chips roughly every eighteen months as transistors become
faster and smaller. For fifty years, the prediction has held, and the results
have transformed the world. ENIAC, the first modern computer, was built
100 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
in 1946 and filled a room the size of a small gymnasium. But by 1983, when
I first studied computing, my student-grade Texas Instruments pocket calculator
had more processing power than ENIAC. Moore’s law tells us that
this decade’s supercomputer is the next decade’s pocket device.
Recent technologies have further enabled data processing on a large
scale with acceptable costs. In-memory computing can accelerate analytics
to the kind of real-time computing that allows digital advertising to select
the ad seen by each visitor to a webpage, based on the weather where they
are, the sites they have visited recently, or any other critical determinants
that can be mined through data. Hadoop is an open-source software framework
that enables distributed parallel processing of huge amounts of data
across multiple servers in different locations. With Hadoop, even the biggest
data sets can be managed affordably.
Other tools focus less on increasing power and more on making sense
out of the chaos of unstructured data. New data-mining tools allow programs
to sift through the raw stuff of social media and pick out patterns
that human managers then can examine to recognize trends and key words.
Perhaps the biggest advances in managing unstructured data have
come from new developments in “cognitive” computing. Natural language
processing, for example, can interpret normal human language, whether
from spoken commands, social media conversations, or books or articles,
without adaptation. It is critical to the development of systems that can
identify patterns in big-data sets of human language, such as recordings of
customer phone calls to call centers. Another key development is machine
learning—resulting in computing systems that can recognize patterns and
improve their own capability over time, based on experience and feedback.
As computers are modeled around neural networks, they go beyond just
spotting patterns in unstructured data: they receive feedback from their
environment or human trainers (indicating which conclusions were wrong
and which were correct) and reprogram themselves over time.
Natural language processing and machine learning are combined in a
system like IBM’s Watson, which can read vast amounts of written language
and develop ever more accurate inferences by using feedback and coaching
from human experts. Watson famously debuted on the world stage by
playing the quiz show Jeopardy!—where it bested the top human champions
by combining encyclopedic recall with a human-like ability to have
educated “hunches” (e.g., estimating that its best guess to a question had
a 42 percent likelihood of being correct). Since then, Watson has moved
to the real world. Physicians have trained Watson, using a library of millions
of patient case histories, to the point where Watson is more accurate
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS101
than many doctors in making an initial diagnosis of a new cancer patient.
Watson and similar technologies will be at the forefront of the next wave of
big-data analytics—informing everything from customer service, to fraud
detection, to advertising media planning.
Big Data on Tap from the Cloud
An additional trend is shaping the impact of big data: a revolution in the
storage and accessibility of both data and data processing. In the old data
paradigm, for a business to manage data, it needed to invest in owned infrastructure
to collect and hold all of the data as well as any tools to analyze
it. This significant capital requirement led to disparities among companies,
with many unable to afford the sophisticated use of data. Today, businesses
no longer need to store their own data, and even small businesses are
increasingly able to access the leading tools for using unstructured data.
The reason is the rise of cloud computing.
Think of voice-recognition systems like Siri or Google Now on our
smartphones. There is a reason Siri doesn’t work when our iPhones are
offline: the computations required to understand spoken language and
respond to it are too intensive to be managed with the processors on a current
smartphone. Yet Siri works perfectly fine when able to access the cloud.
All our device needs is a steady connection so that it can send our voice to
a remote server with all the power necessary to process that unstructured
data and respond in real time.
Increasingly, more and more computing applications and services
are delivered seamlessly over the Internet, with the real processing power
residing in the cloud rather than on our devices and computers. Amazon
Web Services (the company’s huge B2B computer services division), Microsoft,
Google, and others are all driving a shift to a computing environment
where businesses increasingly meet their needs through subscription and
SaaS offerings rather than by buying and installing the most powerful computers
on their own premises.
Cloud computing has profound implications for scalability and small
business. Services like Watson are available “on tap” to businesses, just like
cloud-based storage and customer databases are for small businesses. This
means that big data is not the exclusive terrain of the world-class companies
with huge IT departments. Any business can tap into best-in-class analytics
tools today—from cloud providers like SAP and IBM—paying only for the
data and the processing it uses. Big data doesn’t have to have a big price tag.
Three Myths of Big Data
Although the rise of big data—the new unstructured data sets and the tools to
make sense of them—is influencing every industry, there are some myths and
misconceptions about what exactly has changed for businesses.
Myth 1: The Algorithm Will Figure It Out
I also call this the myth of the magic algorithm. Early reporting about big data
created a false impression that to build the smart cities and businesses of the
future, we would just put the best supercomputers together, let them compare
all our unstructured data sets and unearth unexpected patterns, and voila! Your
insights would appear on screen. In reality, this is not how data analytics is done.
Making sense of big data still requires a lot of involvement by skilled human
analysts. There are several reasons for this. The quality and accuracy of the data
are critical. How was the data collected? Is there a margin of error? Is it truly a
representative sample? Are different data sets in the same format so they can be
accurately compared? Much data wrangling is still done by human analysts, as
these issues are not yet fully automated by software.
Biases can also exist in the algorithms used to look at the data, based on the
assumptions of those who program them. An algorithm can be designed to filter
applicant resumes to find the ones that most closely fit the profile of employees at
your company. But past hiring may not reflect the diversity or skills you are seeking
from future employees.
Most importantly, you need managers to ask the right questions of your data.
What outcomes is your business most concerned about? Which kind of data patterns
could you even act on? Algorithms are increasingly good at finding answers,
but they still need humans to pose the right questions. Tariq Shaukat, chief commercial
officer of Caesar’s Entertainment, puts it this way: “If you start with the
data, you will end with the data. The question that I ask my teams all the time is,
‘What question are we trying to answer?’”7
Myth 2: Correlation Is All That Matters
Spotting a pattern is not (always) enough. Some commenters on big data have
reported that data science is no longer concerned with causation, just correlation.
The belief is that underlying patterns across data sets are a truth unto themselves
that does not need to rely on foggy human ideas of cause and effect.
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS103
This is simply not true. It is critically important that managers understand the
difference between simple correlation and causation—and know when this difference
matters and when it doesn’t. A simple rule of thumb: if you are only making
predictions, data correlation is sufficient. But if you are looking to change the
precondition, you need to know there is causation as well.
Think of Stringer, the city comptroller who discovered the data correlation
between declining budgets for tree pruning and rising lawsuits against the city.
If the tree-pruning budgets weren’t actually causing the accidents that led to
lawsuits, his decision to restore the pruning budget would not have helped. In
Stringer’s case, causality mattered a great deal.
On the other hand, imagine your ad agency has determined that married
women in Ohio are more responsive to advertisements for your new hair care
product. You are not going to try to grow your shampoo sales by encouraging
Ohioans to get married (that would be influencing the precondition). You are
just going to use this information to target more of your ads to married Ohioans
instead of single ones. In a case like this, simply knowing a data correlation is fine.
Myth 3: All the Good Data Is Big Data
It would be a mistake to conflate big data with data strategy. In many cases, companies
can build valuable data assets and apply them to strategic ends without
delving into the messy world of big data.
Data does not always need to be “big” (i.e., unstructured) in order to be useful
to a business. Powerful insights can be derived from the analysis and application of
traditional, more structured data such as customer clickstream behavior (Where
do customers click on a website, scroll down the page, spend more or less time,
put things in shopping carts, etc.?). Even at a big-data powerhouse like Facebook,
home to some of the biggest server clusters in the world, most queries run by
engineers on a given day are of a scale that could be processed on a good laptop.8
The point of your data strategy should be to generate value for your customers and
business. Sometimes that will involve big data, and sometimes it won’t.
Where to Find the Data You Need
As you begin to put together a data strategy, you will start with the data
you are generating in your own business processes. However, you will likely
identify gaps in the data you need for some of your goals. Finding the right
additional sources of data is critical to filling in gaps and building your data
104 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
asset over time. Important sources of data from outside your organization
include customer data exchanges, lead users, supply chain partners, public
data sets, and purchase or exchange agreements.
Customer Value Data Exchange
One of the best ways to generate additional data is to invite customers to
contribute data as part of interacting with your business or in direct exchange
for value you offer them. As mentioned in chapter 2, the navigation app
Waze built both its map data and its real-time traffic data through user contributions.
Waze was designed from the beginning around generating data.
Whenever a customer has the app turned on, it is pinging their phone’s GPS
once a second. In densely populated areas, this approach provides exceptional
real-time awareness of traffic conditions and allows for superior
rerouting compared to competitors’ apps. (After it reached 30 million users,
Waze was bought by Google for $1.3 billion.) Because it does not sell directly
to consumers, Coca-Cola historically has had little consumer data. But with
the help of its MyCokeRewards loyalty program, the company has built up
a data view on 20 million of its customers, the linchpin of its data asset. The
Metropolitan Museum of Art was able to gather 100,000 new, valid e-mail
addresses simply by asking visitors for their e-mail addresses in exchange for
access to the Met’s free Wi-Fi. What makes consumers willing to share their
information with businesses? In a global research study that I conducted at
Columbia University with Matt Quint, we observed four key factors: the type
of value or rewards offered, the presence of a trusted relationship with the
business, the type of data being requested, and the industry of the business.9
Lead User Participation
Lead users (a term coined by Eric von Hippel10) are your most active, avid, or
involved customers. Their greater needs lead them to have greater interest in
interacting with your products or business, and they can often be a unique and
powerful source of data. We saw one example in The Weather Underground:
the volunteer army of meteorological enthusiasts who happily contribute realtime
feeds of additional weather data to TWC as part of participating in that
community. Other companies use exclusivity to identify and leverage their
lead users. Alexandre Choueiri, L’Oréal’s president of international designer
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS105
collections, explained to me that the cosmetics firm creates and engages confidential
customer communities for designer brands such as Viktor & Rolf. The
allure of joining a special club (literally called the “secret service”) appeals to
consumers, and the exclusivity helps the brand learn more about loyal users—
not just casual one-time purchasers. “You get fewer people,” Choueiri told
me. “But they’re really engaged. We sell this brand through the retailers, so this
engagement tool is how we get data.”11 By engaging lead users, brands can solicit
input and feedback from much more selective and important communities.
Supply Chain Partners
Business partners can be crucial sources of additional data for building
your data asset. Companies producing consumer packaged goods now work
closely with large retailers and with retail data services like Dunhumby.
Power, leverage, and levels of trust can greatly influence who shares data
with whom in many industries. In the travel industry, large airlines (such
as Delta) can have nearly 100 million customers enrolled in their loyalty
programs. But airlines and the online travel agencies (such as Travelocity
or Orbitz) share only limited data. As a result, neither the agencies nor the
airlines have access to the full picture of customers’ travel behaviors when
they want to customize pricing and offers at the point of sale. Increasingly,
data partnerships will be a key element of how businesses negotiate terms
of working together.
Public Data Sets
Another important source of new data is publicly accessible data sets. Some
of these are in online public forums. The car reviews website Edmunds.
com, for example, contains many years’ worth of discussion forums—providing
huge amounts of unstructured data in customers’ conversations
about car models, makes, preferences, and experiences. Many social media
platforms, like Twitter, are easily searchable for real-time data. In addition,
governments are increasingly providing public access to large data sets in
machine-readable format. The U.S. government’s census data, for example,
has been in huge demand since being made available. In addition, more and
more city governments are opening up APIs to let innovative businesses
make use of government data and to spur new business opportunities.
106 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
Purchase or Exchange Agreements
Lastly, there are many opportunities for businesses to purchase or swap
legitimate, valuable data with other firms. Businesses should avoid companies
that offer shady sets of customer records collected through questionable
means. Instead, firms should seek out the many reputable services that
enable anonymized data comparisons. Anonymized data lets a company
learn things like the conversion rate of offers (the portion of customers
accepting the offer sent). The company’s data shows which customers got
the offer, the retailer’s data shows who made a purchase, and the third-party
service measures the conversion rate without revealing customer identities
(which could be a violation of privacy terms).
Sometimes data can be received through an exchange or donation.
During the 2014 World Cup, Waze shared anonymous driver data with city
governments in Brazil to help them identify and respond more quickly to
traffic buildups and road hazards. In Rio de Janeiro alone, up to 110,000
drivers a day were providing traffic data through Waze’s API. Since then,
Waze has been developing partnerships with other governments, such as
the State of Florida. The company is not asking for payment but rather is
seeking an exchange of more data. By receiving real-time data from highway
sensors and information on construction projects and city events,
Waze is improving its own data asset.
There are many more sources of data available today. The challenge for
your business is often simply choosing which ones will best fit your needs.
A recent forecast published by the Journal of Advertising Research summarized
the changes anticipated in market research: as businesses are faced
with a “river” of continuously generated data, the goal of research is not to
expensively manufacture data, but to find the right tools to “fish” in that
river in order to draw forth the insights and intelligence needed.12
Turning Customer Data into Business Value:
Four Templates
As organizations gather more data and develop it into powerful assets, the
next challenge is to continuously apply these assets to create new value for
themselves.
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS107
We’ve seen examples of how product or service data provides value
by enabling a business’s core service to customers: think of TWC’s use of
weather data and Google’s use of mapping data. We’ve also seen that business
process data can yield value by optimizing and improving decision
making, even in surprising ways—like Stringer’s use of budgetary data.
If we look at customer data, we can find recurring patterns of best practices
used to add value across differing industries and organizations. We
can think of these practices as four templates for creating value from customer
data: insights: revealing the invisible; targeting: narrowing the field;
personalization: tailoring to fit; and context: providing a reference frame.
Let’s take a look at each of these four data value templates and see how
they are applied in different industries to create new value.
Insights: Revealing the Invisible
The first template for value creation is insights. By revealing previously
invisible relationships, patterns, and influences, customer data can provide
immense value to businesses. Data can provide insights into customer psychology
(How are my brands or products perceived in the marketplace?
What motivates and influences customer decisions? Can I predict and
measure customer word of mouth?). Data can reveal patterns in customer
behavior (How are buying habits shifting? How are customers using my
product? Where is fraud or abuse taking place?). Data can also be used
to measure the impact of specific actions on customers’ psychology and
behavior (What is the result of my change in messaging, marketing spending,
product mix, or distribution channels?).
Today, many businesses have access to large quantities of customer
data in the form of online conversations about their products and brands.
A good example is automobile manufacturers. My colleague Oded Netzer
of Columbia Business School, along with three research coauthors,13 has
dug into the data created by discussion forums to explore what it reveals
about the automotive market structure and consumer behavior. Netzer’s
team applied a variety of text-mining tools—algorithms that are trained on
human language and apply formulas to detect patterns in huge quantities
of unstructured text from online conversations. One area of their research
looked at how customers perceive brands. By examining patterns of statistical
“lift,” they could identify which specific attributes are more frequently
108 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
associated with one auto brand versus its closest competitors. The patterns
revealed opportunities in terms of audiences to target, content for messaging,
and ideas for product development.
Netzer’s team also used the data to investigate the impact of long-term
advertising efforts. They focused on a period when Cadillac had spent
millions on brand advertising to shift customers’ perception of Cadillac
from “classic American car” (like Lincoln) to “luxury brand” (like Lexus
and Mercedes). A textual analysis of the conversations over several years
showed that, consistent with the campaign objective, the Cadillac brand
was gradually moving—in customers’ associative perceptions—from the
first group (classic American brands) to the second (luxury brands). When
the researchers compared this with public data on dealer trade-ins, they
confirmed that the shift in perception was also a leading indicator of purchase
behaviors. Rather than trading between Lincolns and Cadillacs, more
and more customers were exchanging their luxury cars for Cadillacs.
In another case, Gaylord Hotels used insights from customer data to
sharpen its referral strategy. The business has a few large hotel properties
that are well suited for major events as well as personal stays. With a limited
advertising budget, it knew that referrals (word of mouth from happy guests)
were the biggest source of new customers. So management set a priority to
increase that word of mouth by improving the already good guest experience.
The first step was an internal review of operations that identified eighty
areas of focus that might help inspire customers not only to be pleased but
also to actually mention Gaylord to others. The obvious next challenge was
prioritization: Which items on this long list were most important? To help,
the company undertook an analysis of social media data, looking at every
instance where the hotel’s name was mentioned by customers in public platforms
like Twitter. Customer recommendations and praise were examined
for any clues as to what had spurred them and at what point in the customer’s
stay. The results were illuminating. A short list of just five elements of the
guest experience seemed to have the greatest influence in sparking word of
mouth, and all of them took place in the first twenty minutes after arrival.14
Targeting: Narrowing the Field
The second template for data value creation is targeting. By narrowing
the field of possible audiences and identifying who is most relevant to a
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS109
business, customer data can help drive greater results from every interaction
with customers. In the past, customers were often divided into a
few broad segments for targeting based on factors like age, zip code, and
product use. Today, advanced segmentation schemes can be based on much
more diverse customer data and can produce dozens or even hundreds of
micro-categories. How a customer is targeted can change in real time as
well, as they are assigned to one segment or another based on behavioral
data such as which e-mails they clicked on, rewards they redeemed, or content
they shared. Ideally, customer lifetime value (as discussed in chapter
2) should be included as one metric for targeting customers based on their
long-term value to the business.
Custora is a data analytics company that helps e-commerce businesses
determine the likely customer lifetime value (CLV) of their website
visitors—that is, not just their likelihood to buy in this visit but their likely
profit potential in the future. This is done by analyzing historical customer
data and applying both a CLV model and Bayesian probabilistic models.
For example, when a new customer makes just one purchase on a website,
Custora can predict that they are likely to make six purchases in the
upcoming year, totaling $275 and placing them among the top 5 percent
of the company’s customers. Other predictions based on historical data
include the category the customer’s next purchase will likely come from
(e.g., home furnishings vs. lawn care). The model can even provide warning
signs—such as predicting that if this customer doesn’t place an order
for three consecutive months, the business can assume they have only a 10
percent chance of returning.15
InterContinental Hotels Group carefully uses data on the 71 million
members of its Priority Club loyalty program to understand and target
them more effectively. This data includes much more than zip code and
hotel room preferences. Up to 4,000 different data attributes—such as
their income level, their preferred booking channel, their use of rewards
points, and whether they tend to stay over weekends—are used to assign
each member to a customer group. This level of segmentation has allowed
the hotel to shift from sending out a dozen varieties of an e-mail marketing
message to sending out 1,552 different variations, targeted around
past behaviors and special offers such as local events. These new marketing
campaigns have generated a conversion rate (the portion of customers
accepting the offer sent) that is 35 percent higher than that of less targeted
campaigns the year before.16
110 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
Using data for targeting can even have a powerful impact in a field
like nonprofit health care, thanks to a practice known as “hot spotting.”
Dr. Jeffrey Brenner, a family physician in Camden, New Jersey, studied
medical billing records from hospitals in his hometown and discovered
that 1 percent of the town’s population was responsible for 30 percent
of its health-care costs. “A small sliver of patients are responsible for
much of the costs, but we really ignore them,” said Brenner.17 He used
that data, and small grants from philanthropies, to start the Camden
Coalition of Healthcare Providers and focus on “spotting” these patients
and improving their care. Over three years, the organization was able to
reduce emergency room visits by 40 percent among the initial group of
the “worst of the worst” patients and to reduce that group’s hospital bills
by 56 percent.18
Personalization: Tailoring to Fit
Once businesses are targeting micro-segments of customers, the next
opportunity is to treat them each differently, in ways that are most relevant
and valuable to them. This is the third template for creating value:
personalization. By tailoring their messaging, offers, pricing, services, and
products to fit the needs of each customer, businesses can increase the value
they deliver.
Kimberly-Clark, which sells some of the biggest brands in diapers
(among other personal care products), uses an audience management platform
that integrates data from sales and media channels to build an integrated
view of the “customer journey” of each customer. For the company’s
business, that means tracking a family’s progression through various products—
from Huggies newborn, to full-size diapers, to transitional pull-ups
during toilet training and “Little Swimmers” (for kids just starting out in
the pool). Keeping track of each customer allows it to advertise the right
product to the right family.19
British Airways has launched a service personalization program known
internally as Know Me. Its goal is to bring together diverse data to create a
“single customer view” that will help airline staff to make a more personal
connection with each customer. Know Me started with a two-year project
to link data from commercial, operational, and engineering systems and
put it at the fingertips of customer service directors. But the program works
only because the data analytics are linked to the judgment and “emotional
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS111
intelligence” of the British Airways service staff. Know Me data is used
to deepen staff awareness of fliers’ personal needs and preferences, and
staff are empowered to make their own observations and record data that
helps personalize future trips. This feedback loop helps the airline deliver
more-relevant offers to each customer and provide personalized recognition
and service during a trip. That can include recognizing a VIP business
traveler—even when traveling in coach class with family—so that service
staff can welcome and thank them and offer a glass of champagne. It could
also mean providing discreet assurances to a customer who has previously
indicated they have a fear of flying. With urgent updates entered in the
system in minutes, one flight crew spotted a passenger’s iPad, forgotten on
board, and passed word to the connecting flight crew to notify the passenger.
One of the most popular service touches has been that of welcoming
customers mid-journey when they have reached Silver Tier status, the first
level that offers access to lounges. The airline has seen extremely positive
response from customers, both one-on-one and in long-term tracking of
their satisfaction and their likelihood of recommending British Airways to
others. In addition, Know Me has allowed the airline to broaden its view of
customers far beyond its loyalty-program members, with a goal of knowing
the needs of all of its 50 million fliers.20
One challenge of personalization has been the proliferation of different
devices and platforms where customers interact with a business. How
does a business know it is communicating with the same individual on a
phone, tablet, and PC, let alone through Facebook, its own shopping portal,
or a display ad being served up by Google on pages all over the Internet?
The good news is that this challenge is diminishing rapidly, allowing for
“addressability” of the same customer across numerous platforms. As David
Williams, CEO of database powerhouse Merkle, explained, we are quickly
becoming able to communicate to individual consumers with “addressability
at scale” across Google, Facebook, Amazon, and all the dominant
platforms of the Web.21
Context: Providing a Reference Frame
The final template for data value creation is context. By providing a frame of
reference—and illustrating how one customer’s actions or outcomes stack
up against those of a broader population—context can create new value for
businesses and customers alike.
112 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
Putting data in context is at the heart of the “quantified self”
movement—evidenced by customers’ rising interest in measuring their
diet, exercise, heart rates, sleep patterns, and other biological markers. Nike
was one of the first companies to tap into this trend with its Nike+ platform,
which originally used in-shoe sensors, then the Nike Fuel wristband,
and later mobile software apps. At each stage of its development, Nike+
has been designed to let customers capture their data and share it with
their online communities. Nike customers who track their running data
don’t just want to know how they did today; they also want to know how
today’s performance compares to their own performance over the last week
or month, to the goals they have set, and to the activity of friends in their
social network. Context is king.
Comparing their own data with the data of others can also add value
by helping customers understand the probabilities of different outcomes.
Naviance is a popular platform for U.S. high school students preparing for
the college search and application process. One of its primary services is a
tool that lets students upload their transcript data (test scores, class grades,
high school attended) and compare it against a huge database of students
who have applied to college while using Naviance. Based on the past results
of similar applicants, the platform can show students their likely odds for
admission to different colleges they are considering. Rather than applying
in the dark (as we did in my day), students can use Naviance to find out
which college on their list is a long shot, which one is a sure thing, and
which schools fall in between.
Sharing and comparing customer data can be a powerful way to identify
hazards. BillGuard is a popular financial protection app that tracks its
customers’ credit card statements and helps identify both fraudulent billing
(e.g., if the card was one of 50 million hacked in the latest cyberscandal)
and “grey” charges (hidden fees customers likely didn’t realize a company
was charging them). BillGuard’s algorithms are effective precisely because
they compare a customer’s bills against the anonymized bills of peers and
against whatever charges were flagged as questionable by any other customers
in its community.
Other examples of businesses using data for context include Glassdoor,
which lets job seekers compare their salaries with averages for
others in their industry and role, and Pricing Engine, which helps small
businesses improve their digital advertising spending (on platforms like
Google AdWords) by comparing their own success rates with those of
their peers.

Tool: The Data Value Generator
We’ve looked now at the different types of data being used in business
today. We’ve examined the sources where businesses can find more data
to fill in their own gaps. And we’ve seen four templates for generating new
value using customer data. Let’s look now at how to apply these concepts to
generate new strategic options for data initiatives in your own organization.
That is the focus of our next tool, the Data Value Generator.
The tool follows a five-step process for generating new strategic ideas
for data (see figure 4.1). Let’s look at each of the steps in detail.
Step 1: Area of Impact and Key Performance Indicators
The first step is to define the area of your business you are seeking to
impact or improve through a new data initiative. You might define it
as a specific business unit (e.g., product line), a division (e.g., marketing),
or a new venture. You might decide that you are looking to apply
data to improve customer service at a resort, to develop better product

recommendations, to improve outbound communications to existing customers,
to improve the customer call center, or to develop a new app to
drive customer engagement.
Once you have defined the area of impact, you should identify your
primary business objectives in that area. What goals are you hoping to support?
In addition to broad goals, what are your established key performance
indicators (KPIs) that are being used to measure performance? Because this
is a data-driven project, you will want to think about highly measurable
outcomes, those where you may be able to clearly measure impact. It is
alright if you identify multiple objectives and KPIs at this step; you may end
up seeking to influence one or more as you generate your strategic ideas.
Step 2: Value Template Selection
Now that you know the domain you are focused on, look back at the four
templates for value creation, and identify one or more that may be most
relevant to your objectives:
􀁲􀀁 Insight: Understanding customers’ psychology, their behaviors, and the
impact of business actions
􀁲􀀁 Targeting: Narrowing your audience, knowing who to reach, and using
advanced segmentation
􀁲􀀁 Personalization: Treating different customers differently to increase relevance
and results
􀁲􀀁 Context: Relating one customer’s data to the data of a larger population
Which template is most relevant to your business domain? To the KPIs
you are focusing on? Which may affect those goals more indirectly? (For
example, insights into customer brand perceptions could help influence
a goal of market penetration if you can identify the right opportunity to
reposition your product.)
You could choose to pursue one template or a combination. Note that
targeting and personalization often work together. Whereas targeting efforts
are sometimes focused only on identifying the right audience, effective personalization
requires that you have some system of targeted segmenting in
place. You may already have one template or another more developed (e.g.,
you are strong on segmentation but weak on consumer insights). The question
is, What area of value creation is the next focus for your data strategy?
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS115
Step 3: Concept Generation
Now that you have selected a value template (or more than one), you will
want to use it to ideate specific ways that data could deliver more value to
your customers and your business.
For example, if you select context, how can you best use contextual
information to influence desired behaviors? Behavioral economics has
revealed that seeing our data in context can be an extremely powerful
motivator. Voters are more likely to be persuaded to make it to the polls
when reminded of their own past voting history and that of their neighbors.
Using this insight, Opower has developed a data-driven service to
influence home power consumption. The company, which works with local
utilities, shows consumers data on how their own energy usage compares
with that of their neighbors. The result: consumers are much more likely to
reduce their energy consumption when shown comparative data.
Concept generation should aim for this level of concrete application
so you can really define the possible data strategy. For a personalization
strategy, what are the specific moments of customer interaction that you
are trying to personalize? For example, hotel and casino company Caesar’s
Entertainment has pursued a strategy similar to that of British Airways—
using data for the personalization of service, starting from a loyalty program
and aiming to increase repeat business. But Caesar’s focuses on a
different set of moments. For example, Caesar’s can determine when a
repeat visitor is having a bad night on the gambling floor and will send service
staff to offer an unexpected gift—a steak dinner, tickets to a show—so
the customer won’t leave feeling they had “bad luck” at Caesar’s and should
try another casino.
At the concept generation stage, you want to produce specific ideas for
putting the data to work in your business.
Step 4: Data Audit
Now that you have a strategy in mind, you need to assemble the data that
it will require. That starts with surveying what data you already have that
could be used to enable or power your strategy. You may have a large, established
data set based on your core product or service (like TWC). You may
be starting with a data set on website visitors, or you may have access to
116 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
loyalty-program data. For some businesses, the only data may be an incomplete
list of customer e-mail addresses.
Next you should identify what data you still need. For the purpose of
the strategy you have sketched out, what data is still lacking? What will it
take to provide the full view of the customer needed by your new initiative?
You may need to increase your data in terms of
􀁲􀀁 more records or rows (e.g., expanding from a limited sample of your
customers to a much broader list),
􀁲􀀁 more types of data (e.g., adding preference data and transaction data to
your customer contact data), or
􀁲􀀁 more historical data (e.g., going back many months in time in order to
develop an effective analytics tool that can model and predict future
outcomes).
Lastly, now that you’ve identified the gaps, you need to determine ways
to fill them. This is where you can apply the options discussed earlier: customer
value exchange, lead users, supply chain partners, public data sets,
and purchase or exchange agreements.
Step 5: Execution Plan
For your data strategy to be effective, you must do more than assemble the
right bits of data (the zeroes and ones). You must put that strategy to use in
the work of your organization. The last step is to plan for the execution of
the key pieces of your data plan.
What technical issues need to be worked out? This may include data
warehousing, latency, or how quickly the data needs to be updated. Your IT
people will need to weigh in here.
What business processes will need to change? Most data initiatives
assume employees of your firm will make different decisions and take different
actions based on your data. You will need to identify those changes
in advance of rolling out any technical solution.
How can you test out your strategy and build internal support? One of
the best ways is to integrate the new data strategy into an existing initiative
at your company. Jo Boswell, the program lead for Know Me at British
Airways, knew that it would be difficult to enlist in-flight service staff if her
initiative was seen as one more competing priority in their work. Instead,
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS117
she integrated Know Me with their existing customer service program,
showing how its data would help staff to deliver on the same four “customer
service hallmarks” that anchored all their training.22 Data-driven strategies
should be in line with everything your business is doing and help people to
do their jobs better.

The Data Value Generator outlined in the previous five steps in an ideation
tool; its goal is to enable you to generate multiple ideas for possible data initiatives
in an area of your business. After developing these strategic ideas,
you will need to test the assumptions behind each. Can you, in fact, get the
data? Can you get buy-in from the business units in your organization to
act on your findings? Will the results really matter to customers? Can you
develop an initial pilot to test your data strategy for proof of concept? We
will look in depth at the issue of how to iteratively develop new innovations
like this in chapter 5.
Before we leave the discussion of data, though, let’s consider some of
the challenges that a traditional, pre-digital-era enterprise may face in reorganizing
around data capabilities today.
Organizational Challenges of Data
When Mike Weaver was brought in as director of data strategy for the
Coca-Cola Company, his mission was clear. “We must understand consumers’
passions, preferences, and behaviors so we can market to them
as individuals,” he told me. As an expert in the area of applied analytics,
Weaver saw that this required building a data asset in an industry that is
not traditionally rich in consumer data. By combining its MyCokeRewards
loyalty program with a variety of other data sets—observed behaviors on
its websites, social log-ins via Facebook, cookie stitching, and data from
various partners—the company was able to advance rapidly toward its goal
of becoming a more data-driven marketer.
But the biggest challenges, Weaver told me, were organizational,
not technical. He compared the process of shifting business practices
at “the world’s greatest brand/mass media company” to turning an aircraft
carrier at sea. He knew that the right data models could be used to
develop advanced segmentation schemes for Coca-Cola’s customers, to
118 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
understand customers’ different needs and wants, and to allow the firm
to better serve and communicate with them. But before installing all the
data centers and analytics models that would allow for real-time targeting
of customers, the company first had to plan out the changes to its business
processes. Before a brand can take advantage of its ability to differentiate
customer segments in real time and deliver targeted messaging to
them, it first needs to learn how to create messages in a very different way.
This kind of targeting doesn’t require Coke to create a single, blockbuster
Super Bowl ad; rather, it has to create dozens of versions of the same
message and test them to see which ones drive response among different
customer segments. The first step of the journey, Weaver reiterated, is to
plan the changes in your business process—before you start buying all the
latest hardware or cloud services.23
In my speaking, teaching, and work with a wide range of companies,
I’ve observed a number of common organizational challenges that businesses
face as they shift to a more data-driven strategy. Each of them is
worth considering when developing a data strategy.
Embedding Data Skill Sets
The first challenge in the transition to a more data-driven organization is
finding people with the right skill sets.
This starts with data scientists—the folks who can do the technical
work of data analysis, be it hand-cleaning the raw data, programming algorithms
to apply real-time data in an automated fashion, or designing and
running rigorous data experiments. Depending on the organization, it may
be using an outside partner for analytics, hiring a single analyst, or building
an entire team. Good data scientists have strong statistical and programming
skills and often come from an academic or scientific background.
They also serve as truth-tellers within the organization. These are the folks
who know that data can lie very easily, and they will keep a company honest
about things like sample size, significance testing, and data quality (the old
“garbage in/garbage out” rule).
But the data experts cannot be the only people in an organization
who understand or think about data. In order to truly build data into
a strategic asset, everyone in the business has to adopt a mindset that
includes using data, and the questions they pose to it, as a part of their
daily process. Part of this is educating the workforce about the ways data
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS119
can be applied in their business. Another part must be developing a company
culture that embraces data and analytical thinking. For a consumer
goods company like Coke or Frito-Lay, that involves a shift from thinking
about marketing as an art to thinking about it as a discipline that includes
both art and science.
Lastly, the company may need someone who can bridge two worlds:
the world of quantitative analysts and that of business decision makers.
This person will be the one who can connect the work of data science with
that of the senior managers or the creative types in the marketing department.
Think of Somaya, the former art history major who learned to speak
the language of both the data scientists at TWC and the advertisers and
brand managers who were his clients.
Bridging Silos
Sometimes the biggest challenges to sharing data are within the organization.
At Coca-Cola, Weaver found that website analytics data was sitting
in one database while data on consumer purchase behavior from loyalty
programs was being kept somewhere else entirely. In order to create a complete
picture of the customer, he first had to bring all the data together in
a unified way.
In many organizations, these divisions are reinforced by departmental
silos and each department’s desire for “ownership” of its data (sales data
vs. marketing data, etc.). In a research study that I coauthored with my
colleague Don Sexton, we spoke with hundreds of senior marketers at businesses
across a wide range of B2B and B2C industries. The most commonly
cited obstacle to using data effectively was internal sharing, with 51 percent
of respondents reporting that “the lack of sharing data across our organization
is an obstacle to measuring the ROI of our marketing.”24
In large organizations operating in different locations, another
important question is whether or not to centralize data analytics. This is
partly a matter of where the data is warehoused but also where the data
scientists are. Should each business unit have its own analytics team so it
is closer to local decision making? Or should one central analytics unit
service the key data needs of every part of the business? As large organizations
mature in terms of their data capability, they seem to be centralizing
analytics while striving to raise the data savvy of managers in each
business unit.
120 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
Sharing Data With Partners
Data sharing is critical not only within an organization; it is becoming a key
element of negotiations with business partners. Contracts and deals of all
kinds are no longer just about who pays what to whom but what data will
be shared as well. This sharing is particularly important for businesses that
don’t own the ultimate point of sale for their products.
Industrial equipment manufacturer Caterpillar now requires its 189
dealers to enter into data-sharing agreements; in return, it provides them
with benchmarks and tools to improve their own sales efficiency and with
customer leads generated from Caterpillar’s Web analytics.25
Ann Mukherjee, chief marketing officer of Frito-Lay, is able to measure
the impact of all kinds of innovative digital marketing for popular brands
like Doritos and Lay’s, but this measurement is possible only due to partnerships
with key retailers. “Retailers are unbelievable sources of analytical
understanding,” and the ability to partner with them around data and measurement
is critical to building store traffic and product sales.26
As data becomes more essential to business strategy, data sharing will
become a key element of every important business partnership with suppliers,
distributors, media channels, and more.
Cybersecurity, Privacy, and Consumer Attitudes
As businesses gather and utilize more and more data, particularly customer
data, they also bring on additional security risks. Cyberthreats that used to
be the concern of CIOs are going to be front and center for senior leadership
now. When Target suffered a huge data breach in 2013, with 40 million
customer credit cards stolen, it was not just an IT problem but also a brand
reputation issue. Sales at the retailer slumped as consumers stayed away
during the holiday shopping season, and the CEO was forced to step down
a few months later. Since then, we have seen subsequent massive consumer
data theft (Anthem), data attacks as a means of corporate warfare (Sony
Pictures and Ashley Madison), and data hacks as government espionage
(the U.S. Office of Personnel Management). Sony Pictures CEO Michael
Lynton said in the aftermath of its own high-profile hack, “If there’s a silver
lining, it’s that this was a call for America to wake up and pay attention. This
is going to happen—in fact, it already is happening, on a regular basis.”27
TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS121
Part of data strategy is developing a legal, risk management, and security
plan. Rather than letting fear of risk postpone action (and likely not
really reduce risks), leaders need to establish assessment, responsibility, and
planning, with appropriate outside partners to support them. The risks of
data theft are unavoidable, but they can be reduced if risk reduction is a
leadership priority.
Consumer attitudes are also crucial to data strategy. Beyond the threats
of identity theft and cybercriminals, many consumers are more generally
concerned about privacy and the increasing amount of information businesses
gather about them. Much of the data about customers is collected
in ways that the public is only vaguely aware of, at best. Advocacy around
consumer data privacy has raised the possibility of government regulation
in many markets. Start-ups like Datacoup, Handshake, and Meeco have
argued that individuals should own their personal data and be paid for
access to it. They hope to create tools that allow customers to store their
interests, preferences, social data, and credit card transactions and choose
how much of this information to sell to companies for a fixed price.
With rising concerns about ownership of personal data, it is increasingly
important that any data strategy be based on a transparent value
exchange with the customer: an exchange in which the customer knows
that data is being collected and sees the benefits they are receiving in
return. This is the foundation of loyalty programs with points and rewards.
It is also the reason customers willingly provide personal ratings on a
service like Netflix and are not alarmed when Amazon suggests products
based on their recent browsing history. When customers can easily see
both the ways that companies are gathering data and the benefits they
are gaining as a result, they will be more likely to allow sustainable access
to businesses.
8
As sensors, networks, and computing become embedded in every part of
our lives, the data that is available to business continues to grow exponentially.
For some managers, this data deluge will seem overwhelming. Other
managers may tell themselves that “I don’t operate in a very data-intensive
industry” simply because that was the case a few short years ago. But the
world has changed. Every business now has access to data.
The strategic challenge for business is to develop the clear vision
and the growing capability needed to put data to work in the service of
122 TURN DATA I N TO ASSETS
innovation and value creation. By treating data as a key intangible asset to
build over time, every business can develop a data strategy that informs
critical decision making and generates new value for business and customer
alike.
Data allows us to continually experiment, learn, and test our ideas.
This means data can do more than power products, optimize processes,
and deliver more-relevant customer interactions; it can also help change
the way organizations learn and innovate. This different kind of learning—
through constant experimentation—is at the heart of a profoundly different
approach to innovation. That new approach to innovation is the subject of
the next chapter.

Innovate by Rapid Experimentation
Think of the last time you used a search engine. Every time you type a
query into Google or a similar service, you are the subject of a human
experiment. Google presents you with search results and measures which
ones you click on, in what order, and how quickly. And in subtle ways,
those search results that you see are constantly changing. Changes occur
in the primary listings, in the search ads you are shown, and in the autocomplete
guesses that start to appear after you type your first letter. Google
is constantly trying to learn more about how to innovate and improve its
search service for users. Which links are you most likely to be looking for?
How should it group them? (Local services vs. global ones? Recent news
stories vs. company webpages? Links to subsections of a website? Biographical
tidbits about the politician whose name you just entered?) To improve
its products, Google doesn’t sit down with customer focus groups to discuss
their search engine experiences. Nor does it convene a committee to vote
on which new features to implement. Instead, the company is constantly
experimenting, testing each of its new ideas, measuring customer response,
and iterating on what it learns.
INNOVATION
124 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
We can define innovation as any change to a business product, service,
or process that adds value. This change can range from an incremental
improvement to the creation of something totally new and unprecedented.
For Google, an innovation may be launching a completely new product
such as Gmail, Android phones, Google Maps, or its Chromebook laptop
line. But innovation at Google also includes the continuous process of
refining, adding and subtracting features, and evolving the user interface
and experience. As Scott Anthony says, innovation is not just about “big
bangs”; it is about anything new that has impact.1
The fourth domain of digital transformation is innovation—the process
by which new ideas are developed, tested, and brought to the market
by businesses. Traditionally, innovation was singularly focused on the
finished product. Testing ideas was relatively difficult and expensive, so
decisions and early ideas were based on the analysis, intuition, and seniority
of managers involved in the project. Actual market feedback tended to
come very late in the process (sometimes after public release), so avoiding
a marked failure was an overriding concern.
In the digital age, enterprises need to innovate in a radically different
fashion, based on rapid experimentation and continuous learning. Rather
than concentrating primarily on a finished product, this approach focuses
on identifying the right problem and then developing, testing, and learning
from multiple possible solutions. Like the lean start-ups of Silicon Valley,
this approach focuses on developing minimum viable prototypes and
iterating them repeatedly—before, during, and even after launch. At every
stage, assumptions are tested and decisions are made based on validation
by customer and market responses. Leaders are those who know how to
pose the right questions, not claim the right answers. As digital technologies
make it easier and faster than ever to test ideas, this new approach to
innovation is essential to bringing new ideas to market faster and with less
cost, less risk, and greater organizational learning. (See table 5.1.)
This chapter explores how rapid experimentation is transforming the
way innovation happens and how digital technologies are making experimentation
both more possible and more necessary. We will consider two
complementary methods of experimentation for innovators. We will also
examine how organizations must change to become effective experimenters
and what the real financial benefits are of learning to take an experimental
approach to innovation. The chapter presents two strategic planning tools,
each one offering a method for designing, running, and capturing value
from innovation experiments. It also explores the four paths to scaling
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION125
up an innovation and offers guidance on choosing the appropriate one.
By applying these frameworks and tools, businesses can learn faster, fail
cheaper and smarter, and shorten the time to successful innovation.
But, first, let’s look at a case study of a company using experimentation
to rethink how it innovates for customers.
How to Grow the Innovation Premium: Intuit’s Story
Since its founding in 1983, Intuit has focused on designing and selling great
accounting and finance tools for individuals and small businesses. With a
track record of innovative products, the company grew from a start-up to
a company worth billions. But after twenty-four years, founder Scott Cook
realized the firm needed to change its model of product innovation if it was
going to continue to grow. He started a new initiative with Kaaren Hanson
that focused on rapid experimentation. When I met Hanson in 2013, she
was chief innovation officer, and Intuit had run over 1,300 experiments in
the previous six months. To provide a sense of how this new model for
innovation worked, she described a project in India.2
Deepa Bachu was the head of Intuit’s emerging markets team. The team
had been tasked with developing a product for India’s farmers, who make
up the bulk of the economy. After spending time immersed with small
farmers to discover their pain points and customer needs, the team found
a pressing problem for those who were selling perishable goods, such as

produce. These farmers, they learned, could afford to travel to only one
market (or mandi) when it was time to find a merchant to buy their crop.
When they did, they negotiated prices with a mandi agent, but there was
a complete lack of market transparency. The mandi agents would actually
put a cloth over their hand when indicating to one farmer the price they
would pay for goods so that the next farmer in line could not see the price.
Without access to refrigeration, the farmers had limited time to sell their
perishables and no way to find the best buyer based on local supply and
demand. In many cases, the farmers were forced to unload their produce
for deeply discounted prices just to bring some income home. Bachu’s team
set a goal: develop a product that could help farmers raise their income
from crop sales by 10 percent. Then they set to work generating ideas.3
The team’s first solution was to create an eBay-like marketplace where
buyers and sellers could find each other and negotiate prices before sellers
loaded their produce and traveled to market. But when they presented
mock-ups of the product to mandi agents, they discovered the agents would
be unwilling to offer a price for produce without inspecting it first in person.
The team’s second solution was to create a service that would let farmers
alert each other to what crops they were growing so that each farmer could
make a better guess as to what crops would be in higher demand. But when
the Intuit team tested this idea, they found that farmers were unclear how
to act on the information. The team’s third solution was to provide an SMS
notification service that would inform farmers of the prices being offered
at various markets before they left their farms. Bachu realized there were
several assumptions behind this product idea: Could the farmers read the
text messages? Would the mandi agents provide prices to Intuit to share?
Would they honor those prices when the farmers arrived at the market?
The team decided to run an experiment and recruited fifty farmers and five
mandi agents willing to try out the notification service. For six weeks, two
Intuit team members went into the markets to gather pricing information,
while a third team member sat in a back office texting each farmer the
prices of produce in various locations. This bare-bones operation would
never scale, but it allowed the team to find out if the premise of an eventual
mobile technology solution would actually work. At the end of the test,
they found that both farmers and mandi agents had adopted it and that the
farmers’ incomes were raised by 20 percent—twice the original goal. That
impact continued as the final product, now called Fasal, was developed and
rolled out as an automated service providing customized text messages to
the more than 1 million participating farmers.4
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION127
The experiment-driven approach to innovation was not isolated to
emerging markets but became the hallmark of Intuit’s company-wide
efforts to rethink innovation. “We have gone from a company of 8,000
employees to 8,000 innovators,” Hanson told me.5 Over the five years the
company had been using this new approach, its innovation premium—the
portion of its market capitalization attributable to future innovation—grew
from 20 to 29 percent, adding $1.8 billion in value.6 In shifting to a culture
of rapid experimentation, the company had made a bet on running a large
enterprise as a lab for continuous learning. That bet paid off big.
Experimentation Is Learning
Experimentation can be defined as an iterative process of learning what
does and does not work. The goal of a business experiment is actually not
a product or solution; it is learning—the kind of learning about customers,
markets, and possible options that will lead you to the right solution.
When you innovate through experimentation, you don’t try to avoid
wrong ideas; rather, you aim to quickly and cheaply test as many promising
ideas as possible in order to learn which ones will work. This is very different
than a traditional innovation process: analyze the market, generate
ideas, debate internally, pick a solution, and then develop it through many
stages of quality testing before launching it and getting feedback from actual
customers. In developing Fasal for the Indian market, the Intuit team didn’t
convene meetings to debate which of their three proposed solutions was
the optimal one. To test their assumptions, they put their ideas, in rough
form, in front of the actual farmers and merchants who would have to use
the final product. This approach requires a paradigm shift from innovation
based on analysis and expertise to innovation based on ideation and
experimentation for constant learning.
This shift toward a more iterative, learning-based model for innovation
has been growing for several years and in many quarters. It is at the heart
of Steve Blank’s customer validation model and Eric Ries’s writing on “lean
start-up” methods. It is integral to the model of design thinking that product
development firms like IDEO and frog have been using with clients
like Apple, JetBlue, Target, Disney, Intel, and SAP. With the rise of digital
A/B testing, constant experimentation has become the norm for more and
more products, services, and communication channels. It has become fashionable
to take the stance of a Silicon Valley start-up and assert that the
128 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
product is never finished and that every new innovation should be released
as a beta ready for continuous evolution.
But innovation in an enterprise (seeking to launch a new venture or
offering or to improve an existing one) is not exactly the same as innovation
in a three-person start-up (whose new app may be the entire focus
of the organization). And not every product can be launched to the full
public in beta (e.g., think of a car). Some of the principles of experimentation
therefore need to be adapted or translated to the context of an existing
enterprise. And, in fact, not everything called an experiment is the same.
Different types of business experiments may not be designed or run in the
same manner or be used to answer the same kinds of questions. But all
business experiments do have this in common: they seek to increase learning
by testing ideas and seeing what works and what doesn’t.
Two Types of Experiments
Think back to the two examples we have seen so far: Intuit’s experimentation
to develop Fasal and Google’s experimentation to continuously improve
its search engine. Both companies are experimenting, but there are many
differences. Google is testing on the actual product: the real search engine
used by its customers. With Fasal, Intuit intentionally tested simple mockups
and a rough prototype of what an actual product might eventually be.
Google’s testing is in real time, with thousands or millions of subjects whose
behaviors can be compared scientifically to identify meaningful statistical
differences. With Fasal, the experiments were conducted with small groups
of customers, and the results would not appear to pass muster with anyone’s
statistics teacher (“What’s the standard deviation among five mandi
agents?”). For Google, the goal of innovation is to improve something
known. For Fasal, the goal was to develop something completely novel.
In fact, a wide range of practices can be called business experiments.
The most fundamental difference is between more formal (scientific)
experiments and the kind of informal experimentation that is common to
new product development. This is not due just to the organizational culture
of the business that is doing the experimenting (i.e., experimental “style”),
nor is it due to the ready availability of a large sample size (even if Intuit had
access to 1,000 farmers, it wouldn’t have made sense to use a formal scientific
experiment). Rather, we can see two types of business experimentation
that are suited for two types of learning.
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION129
I will call these two types convergent and divergent because I prefer
to name them by their function rather than their form (e.g., formal vs.
informal). Convergent experiments are best suited for learning that eliminates
options and converges on a specific answer to a clearly defined question
(e.g., Which of these three designs is preferred by the customer?).
Divergent experiments are best suited for learning that explores options,
generates insights, asks multiple questions at the same time, and, when
done right, generates new questions to explore in the next iterative stage.
(See table 5.2.)
Both types of experiments increase our knowledge and test our
assumptions. Both involve looking outside the organization for answers,
and both require willingness to learn versus just planning and deciding.
But the approach of each type is quite different. Let’s look at them in detail.

130 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
Convergent Experiments
The key element of every convergent experiment is the initial causal
hypothesis: “If I add this feature, customers will spend more time on my
site.” Or “If I change this interaction, customers will spend more money
in my store.” Convergent experiments are critical for cases where it is not
enough to know the correlation between two events; you also need to verify
which event is causing the other.
Convergent experimentation is applicable in a variety of contexts. It
can be used with any digital product or service (website, mobile app, software,
etc.) to test and improve any element of the customer experience.
This is why not only Google but also every major Internet service, such as
Amazon or Facebook, is constantly running A/B tests, in which two sets of
customers see the same webpage (or the same e-mail) with one difference
in design and the company measures any difference in customer behavior
or response. Facebook is famous for experimenting with the News Feed of
its users to find the right balance of photos versus text posts versus videos,
the friends a user is more interested in hearing from, and the kind of content
that is interesting only in the short term or meaningful to a friend who
only logs in to Facebook several days later.
However, convergent experimentation can be applied in nondigital
environments as well. These kinds of experiments are at the heart of datadriven
strategies to optimize the guest experience and loyalty rewards given
to customers of hotels, airlines, and resorts. When convenience store chain
Wawa is planning changes to the food menu, it will run experiments to
measure not just if customers buy the new item but also if there’s an impact
on the overall profitability of customer visits.7
Convergent experimentation is often used in communications and
direct marketing. In both presidential campaigns of Barack Obama, continuous,
rapid experiments on e-mail subject lines and website page designs
helped to dramatically increase their effectiveness in signing up new supporters
and garnering more donation dollars. Starting in the pre-Internet
era, Capital One bank used convergent experiments to test the right promotional
offer, the right target audience, and even the right color of envelopes
as it mailed out credit card invitations. By running tens of thousands
of experiments each year that focused on customer acquisition and lifetime
value, it grew from a small division of another bank into an independent
company worth $42 billion.8
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION131
A convergent experiment can be as expensive as testing two different
store layouts for a retail chain or as cheap as sending two versions of an
e-mail promotion, each to a different group of randomly selected customers,
and comparing the responses.
Because convergent experimentation needs to measure causality, it
needs to adhere to the key principles of formal scientific experiments:
􀁲􀀁 Causal hypothesis—so that you have an independent variable (the cause)
and one or more dependent variables (the effect)
􀁲􀀁 Test and control groups—so that you can see the difference between
those who are exposed to your stimulus and those who aren’t
􀁲􀀁 Randomly assigned participants—so that an external factor doesn’t
influence the outcome of your test group
􀁲􀀁 Statistically valid sample size—so that the differences you measure can
rise above the noise of random fluctuations
􀁲􀀁 Blind testing—so that you avoid the Hawthorne effect, where those
involved in the experiment unintentionally influence its outcome
Common mistakes in convergent testing mostly center on improperly
assigning participants to the test and control groups. For example, a retailer
might select a set of participants (its top customers or its better-performing
stores) for a new treatment and erroneously assume that “everyone else”
(all its other customers or stores) can serve as an equivalent control group.
Some of the key writers on convergent experimentation for business
include Stefan Thomke, Thomas Manzi, Eric T. Anderson, and Duncan
Simester.9
Divergent Experiments
Divergent experiments are generally not built around a causal question.
Looking back at Intuit’s development of Fasal, at the beginning of its
experimentation the question was quite broad: “How can we increase the
revenue of rural Indian famers?” It was far too early to form any specific
hypotheses about a choice between two product features or marketing messages
or design layouts.
Once the Intuit team had some initial solutions in mind and began to
prototype and present them to possible customers, they were not looking
to measure customer response in terms of a single number. They were
132 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
looking for a range of qualitative feedback: “It was confusing.” “I would
use this only if others were already using it.” “I don’t know what to do
with the information I am seeing.” “I like this, but I need it more quickly.”
And so on.
The process of divergent experimentation is therefore more informal
than that of convergent experimentation. But that does not mean divergent
experimentation is simply ad hoc. It is still structured and benefits greatly
from a clear process for conceiving of options or ideas, creating meaningful
prototypes, testing these to gather real-world feedback on critical assumptions,
and using that information to make decisions about whether to proceed
and how to launch an eventual solution.
Common mistakes in divergent testing mostly center on testing too late,
as when “product testing” of a new innovation occurs after development is
nearly complete. In these cases, because of resources already committed
and organizational momentum, the testing serves merely as “validation” for
a course of action that has already been committed to.
Some of the key writers on divergent experimentation include Nathan
Furr and Jeff Dyer (for established businesses) and Eric Ries and Steve
Blank (for start-ups).10
Why You Need Both
To innovate successfully, you will need both convergent and divergent
experiments at different stages and in different parts of your business. Successful
innovation must balance both exploratory learning (to generate and
develop new ideas) and confirmatory learning (to verify and refine ideas).
A/B testing alone will never tell Wawa what new food product it should
try in its stores, nor will it write the e-mail subject lines to be tested by a
political campaign. Likewise, showing iterative design prototypes to customers
in a lab will never tell you what the final pricing should be, what the
optimal marketing mix is, or how customers will behave with your product
once they are using it in the real world.
To some degree, the type of experiment you use may be shaped by the
area of your business in which you are innovating. For innovations intending
to improve your existing core business, you are more likely to rely on
convergent experiments. For innovations intending to develop new business
areas and generate substantially new products, services, or processes,
you are more likely to rely on divergent experiments.
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION133
The two types of experimentation may also happen at different stages
within the same innovation project. Imagine you are a financial services
company planning to offer a new mobile app to assist customers in their
financial planning. You might start with an iterative divergent process to
test out broad ideas, learn what does and doesn’t work, and develop the
core value proposition and focus of the new innovation. Then, as you finalize
the design, you might shift to a convergent process to test and optimize
key elements (features, design, pricing, marketing messages for the launch).
Once your app is in the market and you have established a large user base,
you can apply more convergent experiments to determine what features are
adding the most value for the customer, driving repeat customer engagement,
and increasing customer retention or lifetime value.
Why Digital Is Impacting Both
Digital technologies are making rapid experimentation both more possible
and more necessary than ever before. They are offering new tools for experimentation
and increasing the speed at which companies must innovate to
keep up with a rapidly changing environment.
Convergent experimentation is becoming increasingly powerful
and affordable due to new technologies. As companies in every industry
develop digital products and services for customers (and processes for
employees and partners), these digital innovations are inherently much
easier to test in real time and at low cost. (Think of how much easier it
is for a bank to test the design of its mobile app than to test the design
of its retail branches.) At the same time, new software tools are becoming
available that allow even small firms with limited budgets to easily
conduct A/B tests, run multivariable analyses on the results, and determine
the optimal sample size for an experiment. Optimizely, a start-up
cofounded by one of the early experimenters for the original Obama campaign,
allows small businesses to start running A/B tests on their websites
and mobile apps for free. The increasing focus on data analytics in
companies of all sizes is making convergent experimentation widespread
across industries.
As digital computing becomes more ubiquitous with mobile computing
and the Internet of Things, the possibilities for convergent experiments
will only increase. Imagine a grocery store wanting to test four possible
promotions for its store-brand barbecue sauce. In the analog age, it would
134 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
have needed four sets of stores, each running a different promotion. But,
today, if it can use mobile or wearable devices to push the promotion digitally
to consumers, even a single store could test four versions with random
selections of customers in that store.
Divergent experimentation is gaining new tools from digital technology
as well, particularly in the form of new ways to prototype ideas cheaply
and rapidly to show customers. For new physical product offerings, both
3D printing and computer simulations decrease the time and cost involved
in creating prototypes. For digital products and services, newer programming
languages and repurposable code make it easier to develop “good
enough” prototypes to test with customers. Even in industries like pharmaceuticals,
as robotic systems take over the purely manual tasks previously
done by junior lab technicians, the ability to rapidly and cheaply test new
molecular and genetic combinations is increasing dramatically.
In the digital age, even the biggest companies are striving to innovate
faster and become more “agile” and “lean” like start-ups. Fortunately, thanks
to digital tools, all companies are able to run more experiments—both
convergent and divergent—cheaply and quickly and accelerate the pace
of innovation. As technological change continues to impact every industry,
experimentation will become more important than ever as a means of
reducing uncertainty and accelerating innovation.
Seven Principles of Experimentation
Applying experimentation to a business is not easy. To create the most
value for your innovation efforts, a few principles are critical. These have
been identified by observing innovative companies in a range of industries
and by surveying the leading research on innovation from the past decade.
These seven principles apply for any business experiment, whether convergent
or divergent:
􀁲􀀁 Learn Early
􀁲􀀁 Be Fast and Iterate
􀁲􀀁 Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution
􀁲􀀁 Get Credible Feedback
􀁲􀀁 Measure What Matters Now
􀁲􀀁 Test Your Assumptions
􀁲􀀁 Fail Smart
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION135
Let’s take a look at each.
Learn Early
The first principle is to start experimenting from the very beginning of
your innovation efforts so that you can learn as early as possible in the
process. The same lesson that would trigger heavy financial loss at the end
of a product development process (“our customer didn’t need this solution
or wouldn’t pay for it”) can come fairly cheaply if it is learned in the early
stages of your project. You can think of this effect as “the value of early
learning” or, conversely, “the cost of late learning.” (See figure 5.1.)
Hanson described this phenomenon in terms of the shift at Intuit from a
traditional innovation process—in which customers are exposed to a product
only after a long design and development stage—to a process of rapid
experimentation—in which customers are brought in much earlier to provide
the feedback that helps the company decide which ideas are even worth
pursuing. With much earlier learning, the failure rate for the company’s
product ideas did not decrease, but the cost of failure dropped dramatically.
“We can run 50 different ideas through our rapid experimentation process
in the time and resources it takes to run 3 ideas through our old process.”11

Financial Impact of Rapid Experimentation.
136 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
This distinction is important. In any innovation effort, you are dealing
with uncertainty and inevitably will face a significant failure rate among
your new ideas. (If you don’t, then the ideas you are testing are not genuinely
new, and the potential gains will be limited.) With experimentation,
the ideas that don’t work should fail early in the development process,
long before your product gets to the public and while the cost of changing
course is much lower. Waiting too late in your innovation process to
show your idea to customers has the inverse effect: it increases the costs of
error, reduces the likelihood that you can muster the organizational will to
change course, and discourages you from testing other options.
Many firms measure the costs of running experiments (which in some
industries can still be expensive), but very few attempt to measure their cost
savings when learning from experiments—whether from early cancellation
of what would have been an expensive flop or from course correction that
turns a struggling project into a successful one.
Be Fast and Iterate
The second key principle of experimentation is speed. John Hayes, American
Express’s global chief marketing officer, spoke to me about his company’s
focus on learning through experimentation. He explained that one of
his primary goals as a leader is to get his teams to learn faster—in iterative
cycles of days rather than weeks or months.12 For a nimble organization like
American Express, institutionalizing that kind of faster learning can be a
real source of competitive advantage.
Hayes’s insight echoes that of an earlier famous experimenter, Thomas
Edison, who proclaimed that “the real measure of success is the number of
experiments that can be crowded into 24 hours.”13
When John Mayo-Smith was chief technology officer for R/GA, he
worked on numerous innovation projects with brands like Nike, including
Nike+, FuelBand, and other early wearable technology successes. “Our
goal at R/GA was always about building something quick. If you were
our client, we didn’t spend four months scoping out a project. We aimed
to have something built in two weeks, to start showing to real athletes, and
getting their feedback.”14 Mayo-Smith’s approach to building technology as
successive stages of workable iterations has been adopted by teams from
Caltech to NASA.15
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION137
Increasing the speed of experimentation may require infrastructure,
too. When Edison built his lab in West Orange, New Jersey, the physical
layout was designed to facilitate speed in moving from any insight or
hypothesis to a quick working test of it. Supplies of all kinds—tools, chemicals,
ores, minerals, filaments—were stored in stockpiles in close proximity
to every experimental lab so that delays in procuring equipment would not
slow down the exploration of any new idea.16
To speed up its own innovation experiments, global snack maker Mondelez
(formerly Kraft) uses a “garage” that is designed to get any new idea
from concept to prototype and into the hands of visiting customers within
two days’ time.17 Design firm IDEO places its prototyping shops in close
proximity to its development teams so that physical product ideas can be
fabricated in days or even hours.
Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution
This phrase is a mantra at many innovative companies, cited by Waze
cofounder Uri Levine as well as Intuit CEO Brad Smith. Why should innovators
fall in love with problems and not solutions?
First, this keeps you focused on the customer and their needs. By forcing
yourself to describe the customer’s problem first (rather than the ingenious
solution you are developing), you take an important step to ensure
the innovation process is focused on customer value.
Second, focusing on the problem prods you to consider more than one
possible solution. If your goal is the solution itself, there’s a temptation to
stop generating new ideas when you hit on one idea that appears promising
to your team and to move on prematurely to building it.
The third reason to fall in love with the problem is that you inevitably
become attached emotionally to a creative solution. It is hard to let
it go. When Intuit’s Fasal team was focused on solving the problem of
Indian farmers’ poor bargaining position, it was critical that they not stop
after coming up with their first solution. As Hanson explained, “When
you think you only have one idea, you’re unwilling to give it up. If you’ve
got many ideas, you’re willing to see the evidence that they don’t work,
and move onto the next. With the Fasal team—they quickly learned that
the eBay-type marketplace wasn’t going to work; they quickly learned that
their notion of helping farmers to plant more profitable crops wasn’t going
138 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
to work. If they’d only had one idea? Frankly, they might still be working
on it today.”18
Get Credible Feedback
Once you have solutions in mind, it is essential that you gather credible
feedback on your ideas. That credibility starts with the people you speak to.
They need to be real customers or potential customers—not yourself, your
colleagues, or your executive sponsor.
The stimulus for credible feedback is what you show those customers.
It needs to be something real enough to generate meaningful results. In a
convergent experiment, as we’ve seen, the feedback is based on the actual
product, service, or experience you would ultimately provide. For an A/B
test on its new menu items, Wawa tested the actual food with customers in
real stores.
In a divergent experiment, the goal is to use prototypes. This allows
you to save the expense of building an offering you have not yet designed
but gives the customer enough stimulus to respond to. Prototypes can be
made with simple materials, like paper or cardboard or clay, or with more
sophisticated ones. GE has given out desktop 3D printers to employee
teams across various functions to help them rapidly prototype new design
ideas without having to leave their offices.
A common innovation mistake is to ask a focus group of customers
to speculate on a product or service they’ve never seen, with no prototype
with which to interact. Joe Ricketts is the founder of TD Ameritrade,
now one of the largest online stock brokerages in the world. In the
1970s, he was rapidly growing his new business as a phone-based service
for stock trading. At the same time, he realized he needed to cut costs.
Touchtone phone systems were just coming out, and he wanted to use
them to offer self-service to his customers. When he asked focus groups
if they would use a self-service option, they said, “No! Why would we
want that when we could talk to a live broker?” Ricketts was nervous, so
he decided to offer both options, with a big discount for the touchtone
service. He didn’t install a backup for the touchtone system, figuring that
if it failed temporarily, the customers could simply be offered the live brokers
instead. He was surprised, then, when the touchtone system did go
down and the customers who had been using it complained about having
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION139
to go back to live operators! As Ricketts stressed to me, you simply can’t
use focus groups to get credible feedback on a product or service that has
never been in the market.19
Measure What Matters Now
It is important to take measurements in any experiment. But what do you
measure? As interactions become more digitized, the number of things that
can be measured is growing, and it is easy to get distracted by all the numbers
you could be tracking—particularly in a real-world experiment with a
large customer sample.
One solution is to try to identify the most important single metric for
the success of your innovation. Alistair Croll and Ben Yoskovitz call this the
“One Metric That Matters.”20 They stress how that one metric that matters
most will change over time as a start-up moves from the early stages of customer
definition to solution testing and eventually to revenue and scaling
a business. The same is true when innovating within an existing enterprise:
the one metric that matters most will change over time.
In the case of Intuit’s Fasal, the ultimate goal was 10 percent more revenue
for farmers. And, eventually, that would become a key metric to measure
(as well as metrics like advertising revenue, once that became part of
the business model). But at earlier stages of the product design, the company
may have wanted to focus on different measures, such as “How many
of our initial test farmers are able to receive and utilize the pricing information?”
and later “How many new subscribers are we getting each week as we
begin to roll out the public product?”
Although it is important to know the most critical metric for the current
stage of your innovation, you should gather data on other metrics as
well. This data may help explain the changes you see in your key metric.
When Wawa introduced a flatbread sandwich to its menu in a number of
test stores, the chain measured customer adoption and found the product
was a big popular success. But it also measured the change in overall profitability
at the stores. It turned out that customers were spending less on
other, higher-margin items, so Wawa was actually losing money thanks to
the popular new sandwich. Rather than rolling it out to more stores, the
chain pulled it from the menu entirely.21
140 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
Test Your Assumptions
Another key principle of experimentation is to test your assumptions.
Although this is essential to eliminating risk in any new venture, it is especially
important for innovations that take your business into unknown
territory.
When Jenn Hyman was still an MBA student, she developed an idea for
a new company. Seeing her sister agonizing over whether to spend $1,500
on a Marchesa dress to wear to a friend’s wedding, she saw a great business
opportunity: Why not offer to rent designer dresses for special occasions?
Joined by classmate Jenny Fleiss, Hyman decided to try to launch a new
business: Rent The Runway. But rather than spending time writing up a
business plan with detailed projections on pricing, costs, market size, and
revenue, the two decided to start running experiments to see if their basic
idea would even work.22
The business seemed promising to Hyman and Fleiss, but they realized
that their idea was based on assumptions about customers, their interests,
and their willingness to pay for such a service, not to mention product
selection, the durability of dresses during repeated rentals, and the right
channel to market their service. So they made a plan and methodically
tested their assumptions in a series of experiments. Their first two market
tests were run on college campuses (Harvard and Yale); at each, they sent
out invitations to students, rented a room, and brought a large selection
of designer dresses for rent. They quickly validated the assumption that
middle- and upper-income women would pay one-tenth the price of a
designer dress to be able to rent it for one occasion. They also tested what
the impact of selection size was (increasing the number of styles raised
the rate of rentals) and whether the dresses would be returned in good
shape (only 4 percent came back with stains, which were easily removed).
In their third experiment, they tested whether customers would still rent
the dresses if they could not try them on in person (their plan for the
business was to offer rentals online). Rather than hiring a Web designer
to build a website, they sent e-mails with photos of rental dresses to 1,000
women in New York City. Although the rental rate dropped from 35 to
5 percent of those invited, it was still high enough to proceed with a plan
for an online business. In their fourth experiment, they reached out to
the fashion designers themselves. Their hope was to convince designers to
promote the rental service on their own websites, so that visitors looking
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION141
at a dress on Diane von Furstenberg’s website would see that they could
rent it rather than having to go to Neiman Marcus to buy it. They met with
twenty designers, and the response from most was quite negative. Fearing
cannibalization of dress sales, most replied that they would help the new
business “over my dead body.” Hyman and Fleiss knew they had to revise
their marketing plan. Rather than focusing on order fulfillment and letting
the designers lead the marketing of their service, they would purchase an
ample inventory of dresses, build an e-commerce website, and drive traffic
there themselves.23
When Hyman and Fleiss went looking for investors, Bain Capital was
impressed with the speed with which they had tested the parameters of
their new business model and signed on board with the first round of
financing. Rent The Runway launched less than a year after Hyman’s first
flash of insight while watching her sister’s dress dilemma. Two years later,
Rent The Runway provided dresses for 85 percent of the women attending
the 2013 U.S. presidential inauguration.24
Rent The Runway was a new start-up, and it is sometimes easier to recognize
all the things you don’t know about your business when you are just
starting. For an established company, used to operating in its known territory,
it is easy to overlook the step of testing your assumptions when you
are planning an innovation. In their book Discovery-Driven Growth, Rita
McGrath and Ian MacMillan explain how successful firms take on undue
risk by not identifying the underlying assumptions of their new ventures.
The authors suggest methods to identify such assumptions and test them,
and they tie this process to development milestones on any new project.25
This mindset is essential to good experiment-driven innovation.
Fail Smart
Failure is inevitable. We can define failure as trying something that doesn’t
work. Obviously, that is not the ultimate goal of innovation, but it is an inevitable
part of the process of innovation. Intuit’s cofounder Scott Cook has
said that in their entry to the Indian market they ran thirteen early experiments;
two of their ideas proved successful, one had to pivot (undergo a
dramatic shift in the business model), and the other ten failed.26 What if
Intuit had been unwilling to tolerate failure in new innovations? If you try
to avoid any failures, you will retreat into whatever seems most safe and
never innovate.
142 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
The challenge of failure is to fail smart. We can think of a smart failure
as one that passes these four tests:
􀁲􀀁 Did you learn from the failed test?
􀁲􀀁 Did you apply that learning to change your strategy?
􀁲􀀁 Did you fail as early and as cheaply as possible? (For example, you
didn’t waste a lot of resources developing a very advanced prototype
before you discovered that the customer doesn’t want the product.)
􀁲􀀁 Did you share your learning (so that others in your organization won’t
make the same mistake)?
Defined this way, smart failure is actually an essential part of experimentation.
It is needed to eliminate bad options quickly and to build on
the learning that testing generates (like Hyman and Fleiss’s early lesson that
they would be shunned by fashion designers and needed to market directly
to consumers). Smart failure is simply a series of cheap, effective tests that
show you the gaps between where you are and where you need to get. As
baseball legend Babe Ruth said, “Every strike brings me closer to the next
home run.”
Stefan Thomke makes a distinction between what he calls a “failure”
and a “mistake.” For him, a mistake involves not learning from a failed test,
repeating the error, and spending more resources without generating new
learning.27 We could also call that failing dumb.
Now that we’ve seen the seven overarching principles of good experimentation,
let’s take a look at the process for each type of experiment. We
will do this with two step-by-step planning tools: the Convergent Experimental
Method and the Divergent Experimental Method.
Tool: The Convergent Experimental Method
This experimental method is particularly useful for innovating on existing
products, services, and processes; for optimizing and continually improving
them; and for comparing versions in the later stages of an innovation
process. Convergent experiments can sometimes be run very quickly—in
a matter of hours or even minutes (e.g., testing e-mails or Web designs).
Others (e.g., testing a retail concept) will take longer. You can see the
seven-step Convergent Experimental Method in figure 5.2.
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION143
Step 1: Define the Question and Its Variables
The first step of any convergent experiment is to define the question you are
seeking to answer. This could be “How will our new service offering affect
customer retention?” or “Which of these two pricing tiers will yield the
highest total revenue for our new product line?” or “How will the planned
redesign of our customer service portal affect customer satisfaction?”
In a convergent experiment, the question needs to be as specific as possible.
It should also be framed, if possible, as a causal question: “If we do X,
then what will happen to Y?”
Once you have stated the question, you need to translate it into two
kinds of variables:
􀁲􀀁 Independent variable (or cause): This is the factor that you will be testing
in your experiment. Typically, it is a variation on current business
practice. The aim of the experiment is to understand the effect of introducing
this innovation.

144 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
􀁲􀀁 Dependent variable (or effect): This is the factor that you expect may
be influenced by your new innovation. It is a measure of the impact of
what you are changing.
Step 2: Pick Your Testers
The next step is to select who will conduct the experiment. This could be the
managers who have developed the possible innovation or an impartial party.
Because it follows formal experimental practices, the test will require
some statistical knowledge or tools. Many tests can be automated with software
tools. Services like Optimizely provide self-service tools to run A/B tests
on webpages’ content or design. E-mail service providers like MailChimp
include tools for running A/B tests on e-mail content or subject lines. (These
services are inexpensive or even free for small businesses.) Your employees
can be easily trained to run and record these kinds of experiments.
However, for more complex phenomena, such as competing retail
designs, testing will be less automated, and more statistical knowledge is
required. For this reason, an organization may want to designate a testing
team to run valid experiments for innovation projects. Such an internal
team can be called on to ensure the experiment is set up properly and to
assist in analyzing the data afterward.
Step 3: Randomize Your Test and Control
Before running a convergent experiment, you must identify a population
whose responses you want to test (frequently your customers or a particular
subset of your customers).
Next you randomly assign members of that population to one of two
groups:
􀁲􀀁 The test group (or treatment group), which receives the experience or
offer you are testing
􀁲􀀁 The control group, which does not
Randomizing the test and control groups is the step where most mistakes
happen in convergent experiments. A business will identify its question
and then carefully choose who will go into the test group versus the
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION145
control group. When it first ran experiments on retail innovations in its
stores, Petco made this mistake consistently. Seeking to test innovations in
the “optimal” conditions, the firm would roll them out in its thirty highest-
performing stores nationwide. It would then compare results from this
group and results from its thirty lowest-performing stores. Not surprisingly,
innovations that tested as “beneficial” among the superstar group would
sometimes disappoint when rolled out nationally across all locations. Petco
has since learned to avoid this mistake.28
Step 4: Validate Your Sample
Next you need to make sure you have a valid sample size. That starts with
identifying your unit of analysis. For example, if you are testing an offer
sent to individuals in your database, then the unit of analysis is the individual
respondent. But if you are testing two versions of a retail store layout,
then the unit of analysis is the store. (You are only able to compare the
effects of one store to those of another.)
Once you know your unit of analysis, your sample size is simply the
number of units that you place in each of your test and control groups. For
example, if you have 600 e-mail addresses and you send three versions of
an e-mail, each to 200 recipients, then your sample size is n = 200.
What is a statistically valid sample size? The typical rule of thumb is to
have n = 100, at a minimum, in each group you are comparing. However,
depending on your signal-to-noise ratio, you may need a larger sample size.
If the impact of your innovation is large, you may be able to measure it with
a sample of n = 100. But if the impact is much more subtle (e.g., a small
lift in customer conversion rate), you will need a larger sample so that the
effect of your treatment is greater than the margin of error. (A larger sample
yields a smaller margin of error.)
Step 5: Test and Analyze
Now you are ready to run your test. The team conducting your experiment
will gather data over a predetermined time span. Then they will need
to analyze the data to see whether there are differences in the dependent
variables you are measuring and, if there are, whether those differences are
statistically significant.
146 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
When you do measure and analyze the results, it is important to gather
data beyond the dependent variables that you chose in step 1 to define success
for your experiment. Even if you have a clear answer (“yes” or “no”),
you will also want to know why. When the Family Dollar discount store
chain tested a plan to add a new section with refrigerated foods, it measured
whether customers bought enough of the cold foods to justify the
cost. The test said yes. But the chain also found that customers purchased
more dried goods after stores introduced the refrigerated section; the result
was a much greater boost to profitability.29
Step 6: Decide
After analyzing the results of your convergent experiment, it is time to
make a decision based on the findings. This is where having agreed on
your definition of success in step 1 will pay off.
If you do find a desired improvement from your innovation test, the
story may not be over. This should often lead to further iteration and testing
of additional ideas to see if they can lead to greater improvement. In
the 2008 presidential contest, the Obama campaign ran test after test,
examining the effects on fund-raising appeals of changing many different
elements—the subject of the request, the kind of photos and videos, the
“call to action” words on the button that led you to a donation page. Each
subsequent test added a bit more learning, but the cumulative effect was
to raise the final rate of conversions—from e-mail to website to volunteer
sign-up to donation—by 40 percent, or an estimated $57 million of additional
fund-raising.30
Step 7: Share Learning
Once you complete your analysis, it is essential to capture and share the
learning of your experiment. If you are doing a battery of experiments on
the same variables, this process can happen at the end rather than after each
step. But it is critical to both document what you learned and communicate
your findings to others in your organization who could benefit (and could
avoid any of the same mistakes).
You can find a list of sample questions to use in capturing and sharing
learning from any convergent experiment with your team in the Tools section
of http://www.davidrogers.biz.
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION147
Tool: The Divergent Experimental Method
The second tool is a guide for running divergent experiments. This method
is particularly useful for innovations that are less defined from the outset,
such as new products, services, and business processes for your organization.
Innovation projects using divergent experimentation tend to be
highly iterative and may span weeks or months.
You can see the ten-step Divergent Experimental Method in figure 5.3.
Its steps fall into three stages: preparation, iteration (steps that repeat several
times), and action.

The Divergent Experimental Method.
148 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
Step 1: Define the Problem
The first step of a divergent experiment is to define the problem you are
seeking to solve. The problem should be rooted in an observed customer
need or market opportunity and be a challenge that your organization is
particularly well suited to solve. The advantage of defining your innovation
in terms of a problem is that it forces you to take the customer’s point
of view. Your innovation should always focus on delivering value to the
customer (even if that customer is an internal constituency) rather than
on deploying the latest exciting technology or product feature or defeating
your competitors.
The problem definition may include a quantified goal, but that goal
should be both challenging and broad. Recall the experimentation that
led to Intuit’s Fasal product: the defined goal was to raise Indian farmers’
income by 10 percent. This allowed the team wide latitude in thinking about
how to reach it. When Steve Jobs tasked his team at Apple to develop the
first iPod, he challenged them to help customers “put 1,000 songs in their
pocket.” Notice that the challenge is not technical (“fit this much memory
on a hard drive this size”) but describes the benefit or experience from the
customer’s point of view.
Step 2: Set Limits
The second step is to set limits for your innovation process. Because divergent
experimentation is iterative and because we are naturally inclined to
defer or delay before admitting failure, it is easy for your innovation project
to keep running even when the prospects for success are dim. It is therefore
essential to set limits at the outset.
Any divergent experiment should begin with three kinds of limits
defined:
􀁲􀀁 Time limit: Finite time should be allotted for the project and its key
approval stages. Many companies, including Mondelez, AT&T, Intuit,
and Amazon, use three months as a limit for iterative project development
before a crucial decision is made on whether to proceed.31
􀁲􀀁 Money limit: Budgeting for innovation projects is often best done
in approval stages. IDEO charges clients for each stage of iterative
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION149
product development, requiring buy-in before moving on to the next.
As assumptions are tested and project risks are reduced, additional
budget can be released.
􀁲􀀁 Scope limit: Companies should define up-front what they are not seeking
to accomplish. This provides helpful boundaries for even the most
wide-open experiments. For Intuit’s Fasal project, the desired product
and business model were unknown, but the target market (rural Indian
farmers) established critical boundaries.
Step 3: Pick Your People
The last step of the preparation phase is to pick which people will work on
your innovation experiment.
The first question is the size of your team. As a general maxim, an innovation
team should be as small as possible—but no smaller. Intuit’s popular
SnapTax product was developed by a team of three people.32 Jeff Bezos is
famous for his “2 Pizza Rule” at Amazon: no meeting is to take place if the
number of participants is too great to be fed with two pizzas. In my own
experience running strategy workshops both within and across companies,
a five-person team is usually ideal for innovation. J. Richard Hackman has
studied team collaboration and found that the number of network links
between team members poses an upper threshold for effective group size.
As the number of group members increases linearly, the necessary lines of
communication increase exponentially, as n(n – 1)/2. Hackman advises that
a group of five is ideal and warns against ever going above ten.33
In addition to size, diversity of team composition is crucial. This
should include diverse skill sets that relate to the nature of your project.
(For example, an innovation team working on new service options for a
bank might include team members with backgrounds in IT, consumer
behavior, employee training, and service design.) You should also strive to
include participants with diverse biases and backgrounds. Look for people
who don’t always work together or who may come from different parts of
your organization. Include recent hires as well as someone who knows your
organizational culture well.
It is valuable to change the innovation team over time rather than keeping
the same group for every project. You may want to introduce an element
of competition as well, with multiple small teams competing (at least
in the initial stages) to develop the best solution to a common challenge.
150 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
You have now completed the preparation phase of the Divergent
Experimental Method. Next come steps 4–8, the heart of your experiment.
They will be done not once but in an iterative cycle until a decision is made
to either terminate the project or move on to a public launch.
Step 4: Observe
The iterative development of ideas for your innovation begins with observation.
Observation informs and provides the insights you need to solve
the next stage of the problem you are working on. The goal of observation
is to both deepen your understanding of the problem itself and broaden the
range of ideas you bring to bear in finding a solution.
You should focus first on observing the customer’s context—to better
understand the problem you’re trying to solve. Learn everything you can
about the customer, the nature of the problem, and the context into which
your solution needs to fit.
In addition, look for ideas from further afield. Look at other markets
(how other customers deal with the same issue) and other industries
(benchmarking from beyond direct competitors in your industry). You
can also look to ideas generated in previous innovation efforts. IDEO, for
example, maintains a “Tech Box” in each design studio, where prototypes
and product ideas that were intriguing but ultimately not completed can
be stored away for future inspiration. Rummaging in past ideas that didn’t
quite make it may lead to unexpected discoveries for your current project.
Step 5: Generate More than One Solution
The next step is to generate ideas to solve the defined problem. This is the
stage where your own intuition plays its proper role in innovation: to help
create new ideas and possible solutions (not to evaluate them, which should
be done by the customer).
There have been numerous books written on creativity and effective
idea generation techniques. If you do not already have an ideation process
developed within your company, I would highly recommend you read a
few, incorporating the tools and processes that you find most helpful into
your practice. Some of my favorite books include Bernd Schmitt’s Big Think
Strategy, Luke Williams’s Disrupt, Drew Boyd and Jacob Goldenberg’s Inside
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION151
the Box, William Duggan’s Creative Strategy, and Rita Gunther McGrath
and Ian MacMillan’s Marketbusters.
The only strict rule here does not cover how you generate ideas; rather,
it requires that you generate more than one idea. Your aim is not to run
an intense brainstorming process and conclude with a single favored solution
to the problem (perhaps after heated debate among the team members
about the relative merits of others). Rather, your goal in ideation should
always be to generate multiple viable ideas. (Recall the three very different
solutions that Intuit initially proposed for the Indian farmers.) You will
then, in subsequent steps, experiment on these ideas and use market feedback
to determine which one to pursue and how to develop it.
Step 6: Build an MVP
By now, you should have some promising new ideas. But even brilliant
ideas are not enough. “If you build it, they will come” may have worked
for Kevin Costner in the move Field of Dreams, but in business innovation,
great ideas are just the start of the process.
In this step, you need to translate your ideas into prototypes. In the startup
world, the focus is on a minimum viable product, often an early website or
app launched publicly so customers can start using it, responding to it, and
identifying bugs or missing features. For an established enterprise, where it
may not be appropriate to share early design ideas in public, I prefer the term
minimum viable prototype. Either one can be abbreviated as MVP.
The most important point is that your MVP should absolutely not be a
full-blown or finished product. The most common way to inflate innovation
budgets is to overdevelop prototypes (through long and expensive technical
development) before validating them with real customers. Scott Cook says an
MVP should have “just enough features to allow for useful feedback from early
adopters.”34 Recall the makeshift prototype used to test Intuit’s Fasal service.
The team didn’t build a software platform that could scale to millions of Indian
farmers. They sent two employees into markets to gather data in person and
had a third sit at a desk and manually send text messages to farmers to see if
they used the data and if it actually helped them earn more money. This is a
perfect example of the goals of an MVP: minimal cost + maximum learning.
If an MVP is successful, it will be followed by further iterations. As you
progress, your successive prototypes should evolve from lesser to greater
fidelity (e.g., from a sketch to a model to a working product) and from
152 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
partial to total functionality (e.g., from a test of one key feature to a test of
the complete offering).
Step 7: Field Test
After building a minimum viable prototype of your idea, the next step is
to actually test it. This is where market validation takes place, as you get
feedback on your MVP and test your assumptions.
In choosing how and where to test, you should aim for as natural an
environment as possible—that is, as close as is feasible to the actual context
where the ultimate solution will be used. You should also test your prototype
with an audience as similar as possible to the customers you expect
will be using the final version.
Confectionary maker Mondelez set up its “Fly Garage” so that realworld
customers can respond to its prototypes for new product innovations.
“You capture the idea, you visualize it, prototype with limited resources,
and two days after, we have the real people coming in and reacting,” says
Maria Mujica, the company’s Latin American marketing director. “That is
amazing because . . . we then get to look at the faces of the real people and
ask what they like and what they’d change.”35
Before each field test, you should identify the assumptions you are
seeking to validate, which should include the following:
􀁲􀀁 Customer value assumptions: Do customers value your solution? Will
they use it? What will they pay for it? Which customers are the best
fit? What additional value are they still looking for from your solution?
What parts did they not find necessary?
􀁲􀀁 Business model assumptions: How will you manufacture your offering?
How much will this cost? How will you market it, distribute it, and
acquire new customers? How might competitors respond?
The assumptions you are testing will be guided by where you are in the
iterative development of your innovation. In general, customer assumptions
will be tested earlier than business model assumptions.
Step 8: Decide
At the end of each field test of an MVP, you will face a decision point. For
start-ups, the decision is often “pivot or persevere” (Ries’s formulation),
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION153
with the presumption that your innovation effort will keep going until you
run out of money. But in established enterprises, each innovation project is
not meant to risk bankrupting the company!
For an established business, the decision after each field test is one of
four options:
􀁲􀀁 Proceed: Your field test has validated your ideas so far. You can move on
to the next round of prototype development and assumptions testing.
Go back to step 4.
􀁲􀀁 Pivot: Your field test has raised issues. You may need to adjust your
idea based on what you learned or go back to test another solution
you generated before to see if it is more promising. Go back to step 4.
􀁲􀀁 Prepare to launch: Congratulations! You’ve finished successive prototypes,
have fully validated your innovation, and are ready to bring it to
market. Go to step 9.
􀁲􀀁 Pull the plug: If you’ve tested all your solutions or you’ve hit the limits
of your time or budget, now is the time to stop the process and assess
what you’ve learned. Go straight to step 10.
Step 9: Scale Up
If you completed your iterations of steps 4–8 with an innovation deemed
ready to launch, then the next stage is to scale it up. This is where you take
the solution you have been testing in minimal viable form and translate it
into a full release in the marketplace.
For customer innovations, this may include a rollout plan for manufacturing
(where and how), distribution (which channels), and marketing
(advance buzz, launch, and beyond). If you have developed an internal
innovation, your rollout may focus on training, business process integration,
and change management. Scaling up any innovation will also require
you to secure more resources: staff, budget, and executive sponsorship.
Even with launch, though, the iterative learning from and improvement
of your innovation are not over. You should plan to keep learning from
customers’ use of your product after the launch and apply that learning to
improve (although you may shift to a convergent experimental method to
further optimize it).
However, not every product can iterate and evolve in the public eye to
the same degree. The way a company iterates after launch will differ greatly
154 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
between a digital-only consumer start-up and a manufacturer serving business
clients with mission-critical equipment. To determine which approach
is right for your project, see the next section, “Four Paths to Scaling Up an
Innovation.”
Step 10: Share Learning
Whether your experiment led to a successful solution that you are preparing
to launch or failed to solve the defined problem, it is vital to preserve
the learning that came through your process. It is therefore important to
have a formalized process for capturing, sharing, and accessing the learning
from any divergent experiment. This includes archiving or documenting
prototypes you developed, solutions you tried (which may not have worked
but could inform others), and lessons you learned.
You can find a list of sample questions to use in capturing and sharing
learning from any divergent experiment with your team in the Tools section
of http://www.davidrogers.biz.
Four Paths to Scaling Up an Innovation
So you’ve developed a successful innovation. Now what?
One of the ways that the digital revolution has changed innovation
is in defining its end point. Innovation used to focus on a finished, polished
product for launch into the market. Now, with the addition of data
and software to nearly every offering, businesses have the opportunity to
continue rapidly experimenting with and evolving their innovations even
after launch.
Companies like Google are famous for launching products as an explicitly
incomplete beta to get user feedback on how to finalize the design.
Pierre Omidyar launched eBay after coding the first version of its website in
three days. This is a classic example of the start-up philosophy of launching
a minimum viable product directly to consumers—in essence, running the
process of experimentation in the public eye.
But launching an MVP is not an option for every company or every
innovation. If you are Ford Motor Company, you can’t put an MVP for
a new car on the road for customers to buy while you are still testing its
market fit. Apple has good reason for maintaining the secrecy surrounding
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION155
its products before unveiling them rather than releasing product betas for
early adopters.
There are four general paths for scaling up an innovation to a full
release. To understand which path you should take, you need to answer
two questions:
􀁲􀀁 Can you iterate this offering quickly after launch? For software products,
iteration is generally easy via online updates. For services, iteration is
also often possible (e.g., launching a new sales process that you can
adapt based on feedback). However, for physical products or physical
designs such as retail environments, rapid iteration after launch is
rarely an option. If your innovation is heavily dependent on partners or
constrained by regulations, you may also not be able to iterate quickly.
􀁲􀀁 Can you limit your rollout to stages, or does the innovation have to be
released to all customers at once? You may be able to limit the rollout
of an innovation to specific locations (e.g., a retail design or a local
service). You may be able to limit it to a subset of customers (e.g., by
invitation only). You may be able to limit the duration of a new offering
(e.g., a holiday menu item or a limited prerelease of your next video
game). For other projects, though, it is will be necessary to offer your
innovation immediately to anyone who is interested.
Your answers to these two questions will place you in one of four
quadrants (see figure 5.4). Let’s look at the requirements for successfully
scaling up an innovation in each quadrant.

Four Paths for Scaling Up.
156 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
MVP Rollout
This is the easiest path for introducing an innovation because you can start
your rollout with a limited test market and then iterate rapidly as you gain
additional feedback from customers. In these cases, you may bleed right
from your minimum viable prototype into actual product development.
That is, your first public release will be a minimum viable product offered
to a limited set of customers. The relative ease of this path is one upside to
being a little-known start-up: you can iterate and learn with real customers
without much public scrutiny.
This was what Rent The Runway did after receiving its first round of
capital from Bain. The first website launched with only 5,000 members,
by invitation only. This allowed the company to start with a relatively
inexpensive inventory of 8,000 dresses from thirty designers. Once they
saw the business model was succeeding and press coverage led to a surge
in requests to join, the founders secured a second round of financing so
they could scale up quickly to meet demand. An example of a locally limited
MVP rollout is the launch of Zipcar. This was one of the first services
to allow members to rent a car by the hour, picking the cars up at street
locations identified online rather than having to visit a car rental office.
Founder Robin Chase launched Zipcar as an MVP only six months after
beginning work on the business and having raised just $75,000. She was
able to do this partly because she began only in Boston, waiting more
than a year to extend to a second location. This allowed her to test out
the business model and iterate her service with feedback from paying
customers.
MVP Launch
The second path for scaling up is harder. In this quadrant, your business
is forced to iterate very quickly after launching your innovation because
you are not able to able to effectively limit the scope of the launch. (As
a result, your first release could make a lasting impression on a larger
audience.)
One reason this path may be necessary, even for a digital service, is
that the business has to rely on network effects. For example, eBay was
predicated on a platform business model that required both buyers and
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION157
sellers. Growing each side of that equation as quickly as possible was
essential (no one wants to sell on an auction site with few customers
or to browse on an auction site with few products). Omidyar could not
afford to restrict the website to a small pool of customers while he iterated
and perfected it.
A business also may not be able to limit the release of an innovation
due to the high visibility of its brand or the expectation that the initiative
may draw wide attention. American Express launched Small Business Saturday
with the idea of putting a spotlight on America’s small, local businesses
for one day. The campaign launched in just six weeks with its scope
still undetermined. An outpouring of energy and involvement came in
from social media, consumers, business owners, and even an act of Congress.
The company had to move quickly, but it was able to rapidly evolve
the program and its goals as Small Business Saturday quickly became an
annual phenomenon during the holiday shopping season.
Polished Rollout
The third path for scaling up is also harder than the first—but for different
reasons. In this quadrant, you are able to launch your innovation in limited
locations or for limited customers, but you cannot quickly iterate it once
it is public. It therefore needs to be much more polished at the point of
release.
Still, you are able to take advantage of rolling your innovation out in
stages by validating your initial findings and testing how it is received by
different customers or in different markets. Retail design typically follows
this path. Starbucks has tested diverse ideas, such as offering local wines
and craft beers, in a set of store locations in Seattle. The company first tested
wireless charging mats for phones at stores in Boston before rolling them
out nationwide. It even tested a coffee delivery service (via mobile app) by
making it available exclusively to customers working in New York’s Empire
State Building.
When Settlement Music School, an education nonprofit in Philadelphia,
developed an innovative plan for a new music program aimed at
adults, it chose to roll it out in one location at a time. After the first two
locations succeeded but the third foundered, the school realized the program
would need to be adapted based on the musical interests and cultural
networks of each surrounding neighborhood.36
158 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
Polished Launch
The fourth path for scaling up a new innovation is the hardest of all. In this
quadrant, you must offer your new innovation to all customers at once, and
you are unable to iterate it quickly. This creates maximum pressure for your
company to polish and carefully test an innovation before its public release.
This is the path for innovations like new automobiles, pharmaceuticals,
and hardware products. In cases where a physical product can be updated
in a year or less (e.g., some consumer electronics), you may want to aim
for a streamlined first product, withholding some of your eventual features
until the first edition is on the market. This is the pattern of Apple’s
most successful products, which typically have made large leaps in features
between their first and second years (in that sense, some would say the
first-generation iPads and iPhones were both “MVPs”).
By contrast, we can look at Google Glass. The wearable eye-frame computing
device was released publicly while it was still buggy and before Google
was even clear on the value proposition for the user. The company failed to
iterate Glass meaningfully within a year because it was still just trying to get
the device to work consistently. It was probably used to operating in the MVP
rollout quadrant (where it had launched Gmail and countless other software
products), and it underestimated the discipline necessary when releasing a
hardware product, especially one that would be attracting massive media
attention. Although Google released Glass to only a few thousand customers,
the prominence of its brand and the controversial nature of the product
(with its ability to record video incognito) ensured that the release was subject
to prolonged and intense scrutiny. A national conversation ensued about
what Glass meant for the future of computing and privacy, and the company,
which grew up with the most casual of beta-style launches, learned that not
every new innovation can be released the same way.
Knowing which of these four quadrants your innovation fits in—
polished or MVP, rollout or launch—will clarify your path to bringing it
forth and scaling it up successfully. Any new innovation should continue
to iterate and improve after launch. Knowing how to best do so is essential.
Organizational Challenges of Innovation
Putting rapid experimentation at the heart of the innovation process is not
easy for many large or traditional organizations. As they have grown, most
businesses have relied on decision making by committee or by seniority
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION159
and chain of command. In Silicon Valley, it is commonly said that HiPPOs
make the decisions at more-traditional firms. (No, not the river-dwelling
mammal you see in the zoo. This is decision based on the Highest Paid Person’s
Opinion.) Rethinking innovation requires significant organizational
changes, beginning with how decisions get made.
Building a Test-and-Learn Culture
Historian Yuval Noah Harari describes the birth of the Scientific Revolution
as “the discovery of ignorance.” In his view, the birth of modern
human societies began with this credo: “We don’t know everything … the
things that we think we know could be proven wrong … no concept, idea
or theory is sacred and beyond challenge.”37
For a business to embrace experimentation requires a similar recognition:
we do not know what we think we do. This sobering truth is
particularly clear to companies already steeped in the practice of running
experiments. One survey of experiment-focused businesses reported that
two-thirds of the new ideas tested by Microsoft failed to deliver any of their
expected benefits. Only 10 percent of Google’s experiments were successful
enough to lead to business changes. And Netflix has estimated that 90
percent of what it tries turns out to be wrong.38
As technology journalist Alexis Madrigal has observed, “It turns out
that our creativity is good but our judgement is lousy.”39
There is a solution. Companies can compensate for the fallibility of
management’s own judgment if they instill in their employees a culture of
testing and learning about every aspect of their business. One company
that has done so is Amazon. We can see this in the experience of Greg Linden,
a former Amazon developer. He was working on Amazon’s checkout
process when he came up with the idea of offering shoppers a final set of
product recommendations as they checked out, based on the items that
were already in their shopping cart. When he presented the idea, senior
management hated it. It was a cardinal rule of e-commerce to not distract
or get in the way of the shopper once they have begun the checkout process.
But Linden kept thinking about how checkout shelves in real-world supermarkets
are ideal for getting customers to pick up just one more item on
their way out. Although he had been forbidden to work further on the project,
he went ahead and built a quick test version of the feature. The senior
vice president who had voted down his idea couldn’t have been happy, but
the company let Linden run the test anyway. (At Amazon, it was hard for
160 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
even a top executive to block a test experiment.) The data came back, and
Linden’s innovation turned out to be extremely profitable. Resources were
immediately applied to developing and launching a full version of it.40
In how many companies would Linden’s story have ended this way?
Leading Without Deciding
The antithesis of Greg Linden within the world of retail might be Ron Johnson.
In 2011, Johnson left Apple to take over as CEO of struggling retailer
JCPenney. Johnson had a bold vision to reinvent the discount department
store with a more modern, Apple Store–like environment. The retail experience
was to be transformed—featuring smaller shops within the store, cool
coffee bars to hang out in, and new outside brands like Martha Stewart.
Eventually, all cash registers and checkout counters would be replaced with
high-tech product-tracking and self-checkout systems. Johnson pledged to
reinvent pricing as well, shifting from heavy use of coupons and sales promotions
to reliance on standardized pricing year-round. It was a truly bold
hypothesis, but would JCPenney’s customers respond positively to a radically
different type of store? Unfortunately, after years of success leading
retail teams at Apple, Johnson felt no need to test his hypothesis. Instead,
he simply rolled it out, with no pilots and no limited test markets. The
result was a catastrophe. The company, which had already been suffering
for years, fell into much steeper decline. A little after a year under Johnson’s
leadership, its quarterly results showed a 32 percent drop in same-store
sales—what some observers suspected was the worst decline ever reported
by a major retailer in history.41 Seventeen months into his tenure, Johnson
was ousted as CEO.
One can only imagine what might have transpired if Johnson had
instructed his team at JCPenney to test the assumptions behind his new
strategy in a series of early and focused experiments. Rapid experimentation
requires more than curious and empowered employees like Linden
in the trenches; it requires a different kind of leadership from the top, too.
Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer talk about this as a shift in role from “Chief
Decision Maker” to “Chief Experimenter.”42 In the experiment-driven
organization, leadership becomes less about making the big decisions on
behalf of the organization. The role of a leader, whether CEO or head of
a small team, shifts from providing the right answers to posing the right
questions.
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION161
Involving Everyone
Intuit’s CEO Brad Smith has said that “Intuit has 8,000 employees, and we
want them all thinking about how to improve the design of products and
services, even if those offerings are intended for internal support only.”43
But how do you make that happen? Can innovation really be something
that the entire organization can, or even should, be doing?
Some firms do find it useful to sequester innovation teams, isolating
them at least partially from the politics and priorities of those maintaining
the current business. This may make sense if you are trying to pursue
innovation in an area outside your current business or ventures that
may cannibalize or challenge parts of your existing business model. Earlier
I mentioned Mondelez’s innovation “Garage,” where it tests out product
ideas that may seem too far-fetched for some managers in the organization.
Similarly, AT&T has set up a series of innovation labs it calls “Foundries,”
each with 40–50 staff.44
Other firms seek to engage the entire organization, but they do so during
innovation “sprints” or “boot camps.” Typically, these are open to all
employees, with an innovation challenge, a crowdsourced vetting process
for picking the ideas to receive funding, team coaching on innovation methods,
and a limited time frame within which final results are announced.
Amy Radin has served as a chief innovation or chief marketing officer at
top financial services firms such as Citi, AXA, and E*TRADE. While at
E*TRADE, she led an initiative called Innovation Unleashed, for which a
core objective was to use innovation to build morale and cultural cohesion
and tap into employees to create new growth opportunities. “Success
really came down to empowering the employees,” Radin told me. “Making
it easy to participate. Making sure bosses knew that their staff can do it on
work time. Making it clear that it’s sanctioned by the leadership team.” She
focused the incentives on recognition rather than compensation. “If your
idea wins, we will invest ten or twenty thousand dollars to prototype it, and
you will get to participate in the workshops building it.” The response far
exceeded expectations: 120 teams registered to participate in the innovation
competition, out of 3,000 employees in the entire company.45
The last, and likely hardest, approach is to try to train everyone in
the organization to adopt experimental methods year-round in their daily
work. This is the approach that Intuit takes, having now trained hundreds
of “catalysts” who, in turn, work with teams throughout the company to
162 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
help them experiment effectively. The same experimentation method that
was used to develop the Fasal product for India is being used internally
to improve processes in departments like legal, HR, and order management.
By instilling innovation methods broadly, businesses can benefit
from a wider range of perspectives, including those of their newer junior
staff. Retailer Tesco trains the junior analysts at its UK headquarters to conceive
and conduct experiments on small samples of customers. This gives
them free rein to try unconventional ideas that executives who have been
at Tesco longer would not even think of.46
Planning to Fail and Celebrating It
The hardest challenge for many organizations as they learn to embrace
innovation by experimentation is accepting, planning for, and even celebrating
failure.
Let me be clear. In some quarters, the embrace of failure has gone so
far as to mistake it as a noble goal in and of itself. But failure—learning that
an idea for an innovation does not work—is not actually the goal. Learning
through failures is the process that takes us to the goal of great innovation.
But singing the praises of failure, done right, is probably needed at
most companies. After all, it is human nature to avoid failing and being
perceived as having failed. Most large organizations tend to reinforce this
strenuously with rewards systems. But an organizational culture that shuns
failure poses three severe risks to any innovation efforts:
􀁲􀀁 Incremental innovation efforts: The first big risk is risk aversion. When
those involved in failed projects are punished or stigmatized, employees
tasked with innovation will shy away from any unknowns, including
big growth opportunities for the firm. When Bank of America set
up a group of branches in the Atlanta area to serve as test sites for the
use of technology to reinvent the banking experience, it established a
30 percent failure rate as a goal in hopes that teams would try genuinely
new and risky ideas. But in practice, the innovation teams felt intense
pressure to show successes and opted for testing what they acknowledged
were the safest of the ideas they generated. The actual failure rate
in the first year was only 10 percent.47
􀁲􀀁 Loss of learning: When failures are punished, there is no incentive
to bring failures to light. Even innovation teams that find successful
INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION163
solutions are unlikely to reveal the early blunders and blind alleys they
stumbled through along the way. If teams aren’t comfortable sharing
their mistakes, then the learning at the heart of experimentation will
never be captured by the organization. Peers will be doomed to repeat
the same mistakes.
􀁲􀀁 Throwing good money after bad: When failures are punished, any team
with a budget will find a way to justify their underperforming initiative
as “just needing a little more time,” adjusting their future projections
and endlessly postponing any decision to shut it down. Scott
Anthony, David Duncan, and Pontus Siren call these “zombie projects”
and describe them as initiatives that “fail to fulfill their promise and
yet keep shuffling along, sucking up resources without any real hope
of having a meaningful impact on the company’s strategy or revenue
prospects.”48
To avoid these three hazards, businesses need to plan to fail and celebrate
smart failure. Planning to fail simply means developing a process
for evaluating every innovation initiative on a predefined schedule, against
predetermined criteria, and with incentives to encourage employees to
declare their own project fit for termination. Failure planning should be
structured so that shutting down one project is directly tied to freeing up
resources (indeed, reallocating the same people) to work on new opportunities
for innovation. When Finnish game maker Supercell shut down
a year-long IT development project that had gone off course, it celebrated
the team members’ hard work with champagne and shifted them to another
project. That project turned out to be the wildly successful mobile game
Clash of Clans.49
Celebrating smart failure means creating occasions for senior leaders
to celebrate innovation projects that failed, alongside those that succeeded.
(Commemorating them on the same occasion ensures that attendees see
the connection between the two.) In celebrating innovation failures, it is
important for senior management to communicate both why employees
should fail (i.e., in pursuit of important strategic opportunities) and how
they should fail (e.g., cheaply and early). By celebrating the virtues of smart
failure (i.e., learning from mistakes, applying them to strategy, and sharing
the learnings with others), leadership can instill them in the organization.
This approach is taken by India’s Tata Group. Each year, the global conglomerate
celebrates innovations from its 100 operating companies around the
world. In addition to categories like Product Innovations and Core Process
164 INNOVAT E BY RAPID EXPERIMENTATION
Innovations, teams are invited to submit for the Dare To Try category—an
award that “recognises and rewards the most novel, daring and seriously
attempted ideas that did not achieve the desired results.” In its first year,
only three companies dared to submit a failed project for the Dare To Try
award. Five years later, the category had 240 entries (more than for some of
the “success” categories). The winner that fifth year (Tata Consultancy Services)
also won in the Service Innovations category. The example showed
employees how real innovation and smart failures go hand in hand.50

To innovate in the digital age, businesses must learn to experiment continuously
and effectively. By continuously iterating and testing new ideas
and by getting real data and real customer feedback, even the largest enterprises
can become as agile as a lean start-up. Only then will they be able to
innovate in a way that is fast enough, cheap enough, and smart enough to
create new value for customers in a constantly changing world.
However, launching new products and new ventures and refining
existing ones are not the end of the story if businesses are to innovate and
evolve. When faced with deep and profound changes in market needs, businesses
and entire industries can find that the value they offer to customers
is no longer the same, or as relevant, as it used to be. This uncertainty
means that every business must be prepared to adapt its value proposition
to customers over time. Rather than waiting until a profound change is
essential to survival, or even until it is too late to change, businesses in the
digital age need to develop a forward-looking attitude. The new imperative
is for businesses to adapt their value to customers when they can rather
than when they must. The next chapter explores how to do that.

Adapt Your Value Proposition
One of the long-standing industries most severely affected by the digital
revolution is the recorded music business. It is now bouncing back—but
after some brutal mistakes and a steep decline in the early years of the
Internet. A look back at that history may be instructional as businesses
consider the future.
In 1993, an industry body called the Moving Pictures Expert Group
publicly released a new technical standard that would allow for effective
compression of the audio portion of motion pictures, what came to
be known as the MP3 format. This new format allowed musical recordings
to be compressed into much smaller digital files, with minimal loss in
audio quality for the listener. That same year, the first popular Web browser
(Mosaic) launched the World Wide Web as a mass medium for communication.
The opportunity created by the two in combination was unmistakable.
For the first time, it would be possible to transmit music recordings
in digital format, almost instantly, and to store them effectively on the disc
drives of that era’s computing devices.
VALUE
166 ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION
For the music industry, this opened the door to an incredible range
of new value that could be offered to music customers. With digital files
and distribution, record labels could offer customers instant access, a vast
selection of music unencumbered by the limits of a physical store, and the
ability to pick and choose just the album or even just the songs they wanted.
But instead of offering any new value to customers, the music industry,
as represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),
pretended nothing had changed. Actually, the RIAA did take one step: it
sued the companies trying to create the first portable devices for storing
and playing MP3 files.
There are many possible lessons to draw from the dramatic decline of
the recorded music industry from 1999 to 2012, as worldwide sales dropped
from roughly $28 billion to $16 billion.1 One of the starkest, though, is that
if your business does not take advantage of a new opportunity to offer value
to your customers, someone else will.
In this case, that someone was a start-up called Napster. Launched
in 1999, Napster offered a peer-to-peer service for swapping MP3 music
files over the Internet, with no payment to the copyright holders whatsoever.
Yes, it was illegal. But the value proposition was irresistible for many
customers. On the one hand, they had the RIAA, offering them great
recordings of their favorite music. On the other hand, they had Napster,
offering them all those same great recordings, plus instant access over the
Internet, a selection that outstripped that of any physical retail store, and
the ability to find and choose just the songs they wanted—and, oh yes, it
was all free.
After four years of punishing declines in sales, the major record labels
agreed to let Steve Jobs and Apple enter the market with a competing offer:
the iTunes Store, a legal MP3 superstore linked to Apple’s recently launched
portable player, the iPod.
MP3 players were niche products until the iPod, and even afterward,
MP3 owners lacked an easy way to legally purchase music. With Apple’s
design and branding savvy, combined with the RIAA’s deep catalog of
popular music, the iTunes Store became the first mass-market platform for
legal digital music sales.
Suddenly, a new value proposition was available to customers besides
the RIAA’s compact discs in retail store bins and Napster’s illegal digital
cornucopia. With iTunes and an iPod, customers could reap all of the
benefits of a service like Napster, except the free price, but with an entry
price point so low ($0.99 for one song) as to seem negligible. In addition,
ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION167
they were offered the first real lifestyle-branded digital music device and
store, with a pleasing and intuitive user interface that made iTunes accessible
even to those who had no idea what peer-to-peer file sharing meant.
(See figure 6.1.)
From its opening in 2003, the iTunes Store grew quickly, while sales
of physical music formats continued to drop. Gradually, the industry’s
misery lessened until 2012, when global music sales finally bottomed
out, and even posted a modest upward tick on the back of iTunes and
other online services (such as streaming, the next growing trend). “At
the beginning of the digital revolution it was common to say that digital
was killing music,” Edgar Berger, CEO of Sony Music International,
commented to the New York Times. Since 2012, he says, “digital is saving
music.”2
The RIAA’s desire to resist the evolution of its industry was understandable.
It was sitting on a streak of record-breaking profits with its existing
business model of selling compact discs. But in 1993, it was already clear
that this business model was unsustainable in the Internet era. By waiting
as long as possible to adapt what it offered to customers, the music industry
trained millions of young listeners to expect digital music to be free and
delayed putting in place an effective strategy for dealing with the changes
coming to the industry.

Three Value Propositions: Recorded Music.
168 ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION
Rethinking Value: What Business Are You In?
The fifth and final domain of digital transformation is your business’s
value to its customers. Traditionally, a company’s value proposition has
been treated as fairly constant, ideally a source of sustained competitive
advantage for the long haul. Successful businesses found a differentiated
offer, used it to position themselves in the marketplace, and then did their
best to optimize that business model for as long as possible. But in the
digital age, unswerving focus on executing and delivering the same value
proposition is no longer sufficient. (See table 6.1.)
Think of the real estate business, which went relatively unchanged
for decades. Real estate agents were essential brokers between home sellers
and purchasers. With the arrival of the Internet, the core value of the
broker—providing access to listings of homes on the market—vanished.
With transparency of information online, buyers and sellers no longer
needed a middleman just to find each other. The real estate broker could
have gone the way of the travel agent, made superfluous for most customers
and transactions. But, instead, real estate firms adapted by finding new
ways to add value for home buyers and sellers. Modern brokers go beyond
providing tools for searching for just the right listing (including mobile
apps with customizable searches and geolocation alerts to “open house”
events near you). They use digital tools to curate all sorts of information for
home buyers who are comparing neighborhoods (maps, video tours, information
on schools, and online forums to see how residents rate a suburb’s

pros and cons). They have become expert advisors, using blogs and social
media to share information on how to decide when to list your home, what
closing a credit card does to your credit score, and FAQs on titles and liens.
To survive in the digital age, brokers have shifted from being a gatekeeper
of home listings to becoming a resource for buyers and sellers in a highstakes
decision process.
Every business today should follow the example of the real estate broker.
Instead of defining its job by what its industry has done in the past,
your business must define its job to match your customers’ ever-changing
needs. It should judge each new technology not by how it impacts your
current business model, but by how it might create your next one. You need
to constantly examine the core value your business offers to customers and
ask these questions: Why does my business exist? What needs does it serve?
Are they still relevant? What business am I really in?
This chapter explores how businesses manage to adapt their value
proposition, why every business should adapt before it needs to, and why
many firms fail to do so. It compares different concepts for thinking strategically
about your value to the market. And it examines the organizational
barriers that may be preventing your business from adapting how
it serves customers. This chapter also presents a strategic planning tool:
the Value Proposition Roadmap. This tool allows any business to identify
its key customer types, define the elements of its value proposition
for each customer, identify potential threats, and develop new offerings to
deliver value in a rapidly changing environment. By expanding the business’s
focus beyond current revenues and near-term profits, this tool gives
incumbents the opportunity to identify new sources of value in the face
of emerging threats.
Let’s start, though, by defining the fundamental challenge of maintaining
growth when your industry is under attack.
Three Routes Out of a Shrinking Market Position
There may be many reasons that businesses face a declining market. New
technologies can bring rapid changes in customer needs, the appearance of
substitute offerings, or a decline in the relevance of a once-valued product
or service. In some cases, product innovation and marketing can rejuvenate
growth in a business or even an entire industry. But in other cases, businesses
find themselves in a truly constrained market position, where their
170 ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION
current offering and their current customers show almost no chance for
continued growth.
What options exist for such a business? Igor Ansoff proposed two general
dimensions for growth: new versus existing products and markets.3
For a business whose current product-market mix is trapped in decline, we
can adapt his Ansoff Matrix to help identify three routes out of a shrinking
market (see figure 6.2). Let’s look at the dynamics and challenges of each
route.
New Customers (Same Value)
The first route out of a shrinking market is to find new customers to buy
your same offering. This can be extremely difficult in an era where markets
are already relatively flat and open (with even small businesses using digital
communications to sell around the world). But in some cases, creative
thinking can identify a new customer or use case for the same value that
your business has been offering.
Like many paper manufacturers, Mohawk Fine Papers found itself in a
declining market at the start of the twenty-first century as the rise of digital
communications enabled customers to reduce their use of paper. Founded
in 1931, the firm had built its business selling high-quality paper to large
corporations like GE and Exxon Mobil for use in annual reports and other
glossy corporate brochures. Mohawk found its market declining severely

as its traditional customers relied more on digital communications. The
shift accelerated once the Securities and Exchange Commission started
allowing firms to submit financial reports digitally and the New York Stock
Exchange stopped requiring that annual reports be printed for shareholders
(these had made up a third of Mohawk’s revenue). Mohawk’s management
led a turnaround by finding a new type of customer that could make
use of their fine-quality papers: online stationery services. With the growth
of websites for printing photos, greeting cards, and business cards, the firm
convinced companies like Shutterfly.com and Moo.com to try offering the
kind of high-quality papers that were Mohawk’s specialty. Stationery consumers
took to them immediately, happily paying extra for paper that gave
their materials a look and feel of real quality. Within a few years, Mohawk’s
sales to online businesses had increased dramatically, offsetting the loss of
its old customers and putting the company back on steady footing.4
Around the same time, Salt Lake City newspaper The Deseret News
found itself facing a declining market, just like many other smaller urban
newspapers across the United States. After thriving for 150 years, the paper
was losing two kinds of customers: reader subscriptions were slipping, and
advertisers were fleeing for cheaper opportunities to advertise on the Web.
The News’ classified ad revenues fell 70 percent from 2008 to 2010 as advertisers
shifted to free sites like Craigslist and national portals like Monster.
com. As the owners struggled to reverse the fortunes of their print newspaper,
they looked to see if they might be able to sell their same product
to new customers besides Utah residents. They realized that the paper’s
unique focus on a set of core issues—the Mormon faith, family, care for the
poor, and the impact of mass media on social values—could resonate with
a national audience of readers who shared similar values and concerns. The
paper launched a new weekly print edition for subscribers outside of Utah
in 2009. By 2012, Deseret’s total print circulation had doubled, to 150,000
readers nationwide, with growth in advertising revenue that made it one of
the fastest-growing print papers in the United States.5
There are often limits, though, to how many new customers can be
found for a value proposition that is losing relevance in its existing market.
If a new customer base is found, it may simply be a smaller niche that has
a unique reason to remain loyal while the larger customer base departs.
Westfield, Massachusetts, was home to forty different companies that
manufactured whips for the horse-and-buggy industry in the nineteenth
century. With the rise of the automobile, the buggy industry that supported
whip manufacturers vanished. One whip maker, Westfield Whip, managed
172 ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION
to survive by shifting its focus to new customers in the livestock industry as
well as those involved in horse riding and dressage competitions. Although
the company managed to find enough new customers to continue selling
whips into the twenty-first century, the other thirty-nine whip makers in
Westfield did not.6
New Value (Same Customers)
The second route out of a shrinking market is to continue serving your
same customers but to adapt your value proposition to stay relevant to
their changing needs. This is what the recorded music industry did once it
begrudgingly teamed up with Apple to launch the iTunes Store for music
consumers. It’s also what real estate agents have done as they continually
find new ways to stay relevant to home sellers and buyers.
Adapting its value proposition requires a business to be willing to
depart from what has brought it success in the past. When faced with a
decline in relevance and demand for its offerings, a business must resist
asking “How can I get my customers to still pay me?” and instead ask “How
can I become as valuable to my customers as I used to be—or more so?”
Remember the story of Encyclopædia Britannica from chapter 1. When,
after two centuries, sales of the printed encyclopedia began to drop with
the arrival of personal computers, the company knew it wouldn’t survive
by looking for new customers to buy its existing product. Instead, Encyclopædia
Britannica, Inc. tried to reinvent the value it offered while staying
rooted in its mission to bring expert, fact-based knowledge to the public.
This led to experiments with a CD-ROM encyclopedia, then a free online
version with advertisements, and, finally, a successful new offering: a paid
online site for home users paired with a wider range of digital teaching tools
for educators in the K–12 market. Today, more than half of U.S. students
and teachers have access to Britannica content for the classroom, and half
a million households subscribe to Britannica Online. When the company
finally chose to end its print edition, it was simply because it was relevant to
so few customers. “Our people have always kept the mission separate from
the medium,” said Britannica President Jorge Cauz.7
A major ongoing example of value proposition adaptation can be seen
in the New York Times, a journalistic institution founded in 1851 that many
feared would not survive the dramatic shift to the digital age. Ever since
the Internet made the distribution of content nearly free, news as a product
ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION173
has looked more and more like a low-value commodity. The prices that
publishers like the New York Times Company can charge advertisers have
dropped dramatically as readers have moved away from print editions. At
the same time, digital start-ups like BuzzFeed and Vox have proven more
adept at generating viral sharing in social media. In 2011, the documentary
Page One depicted the Times as an organization struggling to adapt to a
digital future; in 2014, an internal innovation report was leaked, showing
the company in the midst of rethinking its value proposition to customers
in the digital age. The Times knew it still had unique value in the reporting
abilities of its 1,300 newsroom employees and the credibility of its brand.
But it knew that value would need to evolve.
Over several years, the Times has shown a steady commitment to
rethinking journalism and finding new ways to add value for customers.
It has pursued innovations in distributing its content via mobile apps
and social media channels. It has experimented with new digital formats
to help advertisers engage readers, including Page Posts based on a native
advertising model. And its content has embraced new digital forms from
blogs by diverse columnists to regular video content to interactive storytelling
through data visualizations and interactive graphics. One watershed
example is a dialect quiz developed with the help of a statistician intern
and based on scientific research in the demographics of regional American
vernacular. Combining the best of the Times’ rigor with a BuzzFeed-like
irresistible format, that quiz quickly became the publication’s most read
online article of all time. A few months later, the paper established The
Upshot, a seventeen-person laboratory that is reimagining what a news
story can look like.
The results of this years-long shift can be seen in a news organization
that is clearly offering new value to readers whose media habits are rapidly
evolving. By 2015, the Times’ share price had rebounded 150 percent from
its 2013 level; the company had $300 million in net cash, and total revenue
was growing again, thanks to digital subscribers and digital advertising.8
That same year, the company announced it had reached over 1 million
digital-only paid subscribers.
New Value + New Customers
In some cases, a third route out of a shrinking market may be possible
with both new value and new customers. Usually, this may come when a
174 ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION
dramatic shift in the value proposition succeeds in capturing a new market
of customers.
One business that made such a leap is Williams, a leader for decades
in the manufacture of pinball machines, those popular twentieth-century
arcade games. With the emergence of electronic video games in 1972, the
company realized that the entire pinball category could be headed toward
irrelevance. It decided to reinvent itself by moving into a new kind of gaming
that was just emerging: electronic gambling. By the time Sony’s Play-
Station had arrived and the pinball and arcade industries had collapsed,
Williams had established itself with a string of hit casino games. Its new
products attracted a different customer base—and a much more profitable
one at that. After more than a decade of growth, the company was the
third-largest manufacturer of casino slot machines when an even bigger
competitor, Scientific Games, bought it for $1.5 billion.
An even more remarkable example of revival through new value and
new customers is Marvel Comics. Despite being the progenitor of such
classic superheroes as Spider-Man, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four, by
2004 the comic book company was facing an unpromising future. Youngsters
were turning away from printed paper comics in favor of digital media.
Licensing deals negotiated in the 1990s with vastly more powerful movie
studios had provided only a modest lifeline of income (e.g., $62 million
for two Spider-Man films that grossed nearly $800 million).9 The company
decided to take a leap and redefine its value proposition entirely by creating
a movie studio to produce high-budget films featuring its own comic book
characters. To raise capital, it had to put up its own rights to those characters
as collateral. But the bet paid off with huge new audiences and financial
success for such movies as Iron Man, Thor, and The Avengers. Once a struggling
company making printed comics for a narrow base of enthusiasts, it
had transformed into a major movie studio with an enormous fan base,
an arsenal of sequels in production, and a small print publishing unit that
could serve as a lab for testing new characters and storylines. Within five
years, this burgeoning Marvel empire was purchased by the even larger
Walt Disney Company for $4 billion.
It is worth noting that in the cases of Williams and Marvel, a new customer
base was discovered only after a reinvention of the value proposition
(from pinball machines to gambling games, from pulp-paper superheroes
to silver-screen blockbusters).
In the digital age, a mature business that is facing decline is less likely
to uncover some previously unreached markets for its same products and
ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION175
services. Digitization has simply removed too many barriers to entry for
markets. The customers were already reachable. It is much more likely that
adapting and extending the value of your offering is what will lead you into
new markets. (Indeed, the New York Times Company has reached many
more international readers as it pushes into digital delivery.)
In sum, for any business in a shrinking market, focusing on adapting
its value proposition to provide new relevance to customers is absolutely
essential.
Adapt Before You Must
There is no need to wait for a crisis, though. Value proposition adaptation
is a strategy that every business can apply even when it appears to be doing
well. In a rapidly changing digital environment, it is worth remembering
Andy Grove’s maxim: “only the paranoid survive.”
This attitude toward customer value can be clearly seen in today’s digital
titans, whether Google, Amazon, Facebook, or Apple. Even as they are
achieving great success, they are looking ahead to shifts in customer needs
and preparing to enter new markets with new value propositions. (This
year’s impregnable monopoly might be next year’s declining incumbent—
think Microsoft Windows.)
But we can find examples among pre-digital enterprises, too, that are
focused on staying ahead of the curve of change.
Founded in 1870, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has long been one
of New York’s top tourist attractions. With over 6 million annual visits, it is
far from in decline. But the museum is keenly aware that its audience’s lives
are changing dramatically due to the digital revolution in media and communications.
It also knows that if it hopes to continue to be an integral and
enriching part of people’s lives, it needs to think differently about the value
it provides. In 2013, my friend Sree Sreenivasan was hired as the museum’s
first chief digital officer, in charge of a team of seventy staff. Their task has
been to extend and enrich the experience of the art in the museum for both
the 6 million who walk through its doors and the 30 million who visit its
website and digital properties each year.
For those inside the Met, this includes new mobile apps for discovering
curator recommendations; mobile games for kids, like “Murder at the
Met” (which challenges teens to study various artworks for clues to a mystery
about a John Singer Sargent painting); and hashtags for visitors to use
176 ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION
when sharing their own photos of each exhibit on social media (#Benton-
Mural or #AsianArt100). “Our audience was demanding it!” Sreenivasan
told me. The museum is also using social media to engage those outside
its halls—not just on Facebook and Instagram but also on Pinterest, where
curators collaborate on joint pinboards, and on the Chinese network Sina
Weibo, where the Met received 3 million views of its first sixty posts. Online
interactive tools to explore the collection include the kaleidoscopic One
Met. Many Worlds, which allows for keyword-based exploration in eleven
languages, and the Timeline of Art History, a teachers’ favorite that receives
one-third of all the museum’s Web traffic. Sreenivasan told me that they are
still learning how best to engage their diverse audiences. “One thing we’ve
learned is that everyone wants a peek behind the scenes.” After acquiring
a seventeenth-century family portrait by Charles Le Brun, instead of
working in secret to prepare it for exhibition, the museum began blogging
and posting photos and videos that show the restoration work. One post
showed Michael Gallagher, the head of painting conservation, using a cotton
swab to clean the oxidized varnish off a baby’s toes. “Now you’re interested,
because you want to see what happens to the rest of the painting,”
Sreenivasan said. “And when you come to the Met, you’ll get to see that!”10
The Met is a perfect example of an organization changing before it has
to and staying ahead of trends in customer needs. This kind of forward
thinking and willingness to invest in new capabilities before an old business
model falls into decline is essential to strategy today. My Columbia
Business School colleague Rita McGrath describes this as strategy focused
on “transient advantage” (in her excellent book The End of Competitive
Advantage). In today’s world, no advantage enjoyed by any company can
be treated as defensible for the long term. Instead, businesses need to think
in terms of developing transient advantages, which drive profitability for a
time but must be constantly buttressed by new value drivers as old positions
of strength may quickly come under threat.
The speed with which a position of strength can flip to one of decline
can be seen in the experience of Facebook. In 2012, the social networking
colossus seemed to dominate the digital world, disrupting traditional
media and advertising companies as it attracted a billion users and ever
more hours of their precious attention each day. But just as it was preparing
for its IPO, the firm disclosed in its securities filings that it faced a huge
unknown threat: the shift of users to mobile devices. All of its revenue had
been based on advertising on its desktop display. Companies like Google
were struggling to retain the profitability of their advertising as consumers
ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION177
switched to the small screen. Facebook had no mobile revenue at all. At the
peak of its triumph on the desktop, the burning question was, How will
Facebook deliver value to advertisers in a mobile world without turning
off its users?
Facebook succeeded by adapting its value proposition for both audiences.
For users, it added value through simplicity. Its mobile app kept the
focus on the News Feed (the stream of posts by your friends) and split off
other features into separate apps, like Messenger. When it bought photosharing
app Instagram, it kept that separate as well. Within its main app,
it dropped the website’s sidebar full of countless cheap and irrelevant ads;
it raised the price for the ads that remained and formatted them so they
wouldn’t overwhelm the user’s field of vision. For advertisers, it similarly
rethought the value it offered in mobile. It dropped the old ad formats that
wouldn’t work on a small screen and developed new ones like video ads,
which performed much better. By harnessing its data with its new Custom
Audiences, it allowed advertisers to, in effect, pay to reach just the right and
most relevant audience, both inside Facebook and in ads placed anywhere
else on the Web. The result: mobile advertising became the company’s biggest
growth engine, quickly taking over as its top source of revenue. Total
profits soared, and the company’s stock bounced back from a dip after the
IPO, doubling in price over two years.
Five Concepts of Market Value
Value proposition is just one of several strategic concepts available for
thinking about your offerings and value to the market. But it is a particularly
useful, and underutilized, concept. To better understand the concept
of value proposition, let’s compare it with four of the most common ways
of thinking about market value (see table 6.2).
􀁲􀀁 Product: Thinking about products is something every manager is comfortable
doing. If you’re an automaker, you spend a lot of time thinking
about your different models of SUVs, sedans, and minivans. Product
thinking is useful (indeed essential) when making decisions about
engineering, design, launch dates, pricing, and other factors as you
prepare to go to market. But product is probably the most overused
strategic lens in companies. Thinking about products can limit your
vision. It allows you to ignore the customers who are actually using

(e.g., Wi-Fi or video)
the product as well as the value that it may provide them. An excessive
product focus has long been recognized as a source of what Ted Levitt
called “marketing myopia,” where a company assumes it is in the business
of making a particular line of products (e.g., daily newspapers)
rather than being in the business of meeting a particular need (e.g., to
stay informed).11
􀁲􀀁 Customer: Another very common approach is to think about your
business in terms of your customers—who they are and how they differ
from one another. This is certainly the first step toward becoming a
customer-centric company. By focusing deeply on customers, you can
ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION179
begin to learn which customers matter more, have different needs, and
should therefore be treated differently. However, looking at traditional
profiles and “personas” of customers (fictional stand-ins based on
demographics, attitudinal data, and product consumption) can sometimes
take the place of actually talking to flesh-and-blood customers
to find out why they are using your products and what needs you may
not yet be meeting. Again, you are still short of focusing on the value
delivered.
􀁲􀀁 Use case: This concept arose in software engineering and is credited
to Ivar Jacobsen,12 but it has been applied more broadly in design and
marketing. In the broader sense, a use case is the context within which
a customer utilizes your product or service. For example, if your product
is a minivan and your customers are parents with small children,
one important use case is driving and carpooling with children. The
use case concept combines a focus on the customer with a focus on
the context, which helps you think about the value being delivered.
However, it is important to recognize that the same customer may have
different use cases for the same product (e.g., parents of small children
may use the same minivan for a night out socializing with friends).
But, used properly, use cases can lead to better customer segmentation
and a focus on the value of your products in customers’ lives.
􀁲􀀁 Job to be done: This concept has been popularized by Clayton Christensen
and Michael Raynor.13 In the job-to-be-done framework, the
concern is not just the context in which a customer is using a product
but also the customer’s purpose for using it. By focusing on the
underlying problem that the customer is trying to solve, your business
becomes more customer-centric and more value-centric. You can also
begin to identify nontraditional competitors: if the job your customer
is “hiring” your minivan to do is to safely and comfortably transport
their children from point A to point B, there could be another competitive
solution besides a different brand of minivan. Perhaps Uber will
develop a verified “child-safe” service that will become popular with
overbooked parents. The fact that using the job-to-be-done concept
results in a high-level summation is valuable (it can focus your thinking),
but it can also sometimes be a limitation (it can lack specificity).
􀁲􀀁 Value proposition: This term was coined by Michael Lanning and
Edward Michaels.14 It has come to be used broadly in marketing and
strategy as a concept that defines the benefits received by a customer
from a company’s offering. Like job to be done, it is a concept that is
180 ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION
both value-centric and customer-centric. However, it is often used to
identify multiple elements of value to the customer (that is how I will
use it in this chapter’s tool). For example, if the job to be done for parents
by a minivan is to transport their children safely and comfortably,
the value proposition you offer them could include several elements:
reliable transportation, spacious accommodation for passengers, safety
features for accidents, personalization of different zones in the car (for
climate or audio), hands-free communication for the driver, and entertainment
options for the passengers. By breaking the customer value
down into more-concrete and more-specific elements, you can assess
threats to each one (e.g., your minivan’s entertainment options may
become irrelevant to customers as their children acquire more portable
devices) and innovate new elements that can be added.
All five of these strategic concepts are useful at different times in decision
making and planning. (I certainly wouldn’t recommend that you
never discuss your product portfolio or customer segments.) But the value
proposition is especially useful when you face the challenges of adapting
and evolving your value to customers in response to changing needs and
new opportunities posed by technologies. This is why it is used in this
chapter’s tool.
Now that you’ve seen the importance of value proposition adaptation
for any business in today’s fast-changing environment, let’s take a look at a
strategic planning tool for making this happen.
Tool: The Value Proposition Roadmap
The Value Proposition Roadmap is a tool that any organization can use to
assess and adapt its value proposition for its customers. You can use it to
identify new and emerging threats as well as new opportunities to create
value for your customers. It will help you synthesize those findings into a
plan to create new, differentiated value in a changing landscape. Above all,
if your company is under pressure, the tool will force you to challenge your
assumptions, step back from focusing on defending your past business, and
use your customers’ perspective to imagine new ways forward.
The Value Proposition Roadmap uses a six-step process to map out
new options for your business (see figure 6.3). Let’s look at each of the steps
in detail.
ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION181
Step 1: Identify Key Customer Types by Value Received
The first step is to identify your key customer types, distinguished by the
different kinds of value they receive from your business.
For a hypothetical University XYZ, for example, the key customer types
might include undergraduate students, their parents, alumni, and employers
(looking to recruit students and alumni). Note that each of these customer
types gains somewhat different value from the university. For undergraduate
students, the value may be a mix of education, social environment, and
certification to help in job seeking. For alumni, the value of their ongoing
relationship with the university may be based more on career networking
or a sense of pride in the school’s athletics, research efforts, or reputation.
For employers, the value of the school may be in preparing graduates with
certain skills (topical knowledge, critical thinking, or technical skills) as
well as credentialing and assisting in finding the right recruits.

The Value Proposition Roadmap.
182 ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION
If you are having trouble identifying different customer types, look to
differences in customers’ motivations or jobs to be done (For what different
reasons do they do business with me?) or in their use cases (In what different
circumstances do they do business with me?). Looking at these is more
useful than looking at differences in demographics (students come from all
over the world; alumni are of all different ages; neither of these factors is
as critical to their relationship with the university as the different kinds of
value they receive).
Step 2: Define Current Value for Each Customer
The next step is to define your current value proposition for each customer
type.
This starts with a list of value elements—the various benefits that each
customer type gains from the relationship with your business. After listing
the value elements, write a summary statement of the value that this type
of customer receives from your business—the overall value proposition.
In table 6.3, you can see value proposition definitions for University
XYZ’s key customer types.
Notice that nowhere in the university’s value propositions is there a list
of products or services or a list of fees paid or ways that it will monetize
each customer type. Your value proposition should always be defined in
terms of benefits that matter to your customers.
Notice also that each of the university’s customer types has a distinct
overall value proposition. Customer types may have some value elements
in common (undergraduate students and alumni both care about a career
network; parents and employers both care about credentialing). But no two
customer types should have identical lists of value elements. If you arrive
at identical value propositions for two customer types, dig deeper. If you
still don’t find a significant difference in the value they receive from your
business, combine them into a single customer type.
Step 3: Identify Emerging Threats
Now that you understand your current value to customers, it is important
to understand emerging threats that could undermine it. They could do so
by competing with the value you offer, substituting for it, or simply making
it less important to your customers.
Table 6.3

“A lifelong network and source

184 ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION
At this point, you are not looking for factors that you know will undermine
your business but simply ones that might have the potential.
Following are three sources to consider for potential threats to your
current value proposition:
􀁲􀀁 New technologies: Look for emerging technologies that seem relevant to
your industry and your customers’ experience. For the recorded music
industry, the MP3 compression format was one such technology. For
pinball machine maker Williams, early video games like Pong were
identified as a potential threat to established games.
􀁲􀀁 Changing customer needs: These can include changes in consumers’
habits, lifestyles, and social behaviors. Facebook recognized the shift
in its users’ computing time from desktop to mobile devices as a potential
threat. For B2B companies, changing customer needs may include
changes in laws, regulations, or the business environment. Think of
Mohawk Fine Papers and the shift in financial reporting rules, which
meant that its client businesses had less need of printed documents.
􀁲􀀁 New competitors and substitutes: A threat to your current value proposition
can often come from an asymmetric competitor entering from
another industry. For Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., that included
Microsoft, when the software maker bundled a free encyclopedia with
its operating system. Other times, the new entrant may substitute for
your value proposition by meeting your customers’ need in a new way.
The publishers of The Deseret News saw this as websites like Craigslist
filled the need that used to be met by newspaper classified ads.
In table 6.4, you can see emerging threats to University XYZ from each
of these three sources.
The rest of the tool will focus in detail on each of your customer types.
You may want to start by completing steps 4 through 6 for a single customer
type and then repeat the process for the next customer type. Alternatively,
you can analyze all your different customer types as you go through each step.
Step 4: Assess the Strength of Current Value Elements
At this point, you should return to the lists of value elements you developed
for your customer types in step 2. You can now assess the strength of the
specific elements of value that you provide.
ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION185
For each value element that you listed, ask three questions:
􀁲􀀁 Are there any ways that this is a source of decreasing value to the customer?
This decrease could come from one of the emerging threats
identified in step 3 (a new technology, customer need, or competitor).
Other factors could include declining relevancy to the customer,
cheaper options, and underinvestment by your business (e.g., if cost
cutting has led you to deliver less value here than in the past).
􀁲􀀁 Are there any ways that this is a source of increasing value to the customer?
New innovations by your business may mean you are increasing
the value you deliver through this particular element. Or the value
may be increasing due to this element’s growing importance to the
customer, scarcity in the market, or differentiation compared to your
competitors.
􀁲􀀁 What is the overall verdict? Based on these combined factors, you
should now make an overall assessment for each value element. Is it
strong (still a powerful source of value for your customer); challenged
(under threat and perhaps not as strong a source of value as in the
past); or disrupted (no longer relevant or meaningful to this customer
type and uncertain to recover in value).
This process should provide a clear assessment of the strength of your
current value elements. Table 6.5 shows University XYZ’s assessment of
value elements for its undergraduate students.

Step 5: Generate New Potential Value Elements
Your next step is to try to identify new value elements that you could
offer to this customer type. This is a chance to examine some of the external
forces that may be weakening your value proposition and use them
as a source of opportunity for new value that you can create for your
customers.
ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION187
To generate new value elements that you could offer to your customers,
look in three areas:
􀁲􀀁 New technologies: How could new technologies allow you to create
additional elements of value for your customers?
􀁲􀀁 Trends in your customers’ sociocultural or business environment:
Consumer lifestyle and business trends may provide new opportunities
for you to create value, even with the same products.
􀁲􀀁 Unmet customer needs: Get close to your customers. Observe them
directly. Talk to lead users. You’re sure to find some unmet needs that
no one is fulfilling; one of them may be an opportunity for your business
to add new value.
Table 6.6 shows some new value elements that University XYZ might
consider adding for its undergraduate students.
Step 6: Synthesize a New Forward-Looking
Value Proposition
The final step of the Value Proposition Roadmap is to synthesize everything
you have learned about your value proposition for each customer
type.

Review your value elements, and place each into one of four columns:
􀁲􀀁 Core elements—to build on: These elements are a source of strength that
you plan to use as a focus of continuing innovation.
􀁲􀀁 Weakened elements—to bolster: These are current value elements that
are losing their impact for your customers and that you have chosen to
try to reinforce and improve.
􀁲􀀁 Disrupted elements—to deprioritize: These are former sources of value
that have lost their ability to deliver for your customers and that you
have chosen to move away from and drop from your strategic focus.
􀁲􀀁 New elements—to create: These are new value elements that you have
identified as opportunities to add more value for your customers and
that you have chosen to invest in for future growth.
Now you can craft a revised overall value proposition for each customer
type. This should be a forward-looking statement of how you intend to create
value as you continue to evolve your offerings for this particular customer type.
Finally, list any ideas you have for specific initiatives (new product features,
service offerings, etc.) you can use to deliver on your revised value proposition.

If you are looking at your customer types separately, you can now go back
and complete steps 4–6 of the tool for the remaining customer types that
you identified in step 1.
When you have finished, you will have in your hands a complete roadmap
for adapting your value proposition. This roadmap includes a strategic analysis
of emerging threats, an innovation brief that can be used by those working on
your next-generation products and services, and a customer-centric analysis of
where your business is today and where it is going in the future.
If applied as a regular part of strategic planning, the Value Proposition
Roadmap can be a helpful tool for anticipating customer needs, assessing new
technologies proactively, and applying resources to new strategic opportunities.
Organizational Challenges of Adapting Your Value Proposition
The benefits of continuously adapting a business’s value proposition may be
clear. But that does not make it easy. It requires the business to step outside

the inward-looking habit of focusing on its own products and processes and,
instead, to take the point of view of the customer. It also requires the business
to imagine a version of itself that is different than what perhaps worked
very well in the past. In particular, a larger or longer-established organization
may find it much harder to gain a clear view of its value to the customer
and of the opportunity, and necessity, to adapt while it still has the chance.
Dedicating Leadership
The first challenge for value proposition adaptation is leadership. Who will
be in charge of making the change happen? Even when a strategy team
is effectively set up to identify opportunities for evolving the business’s
value proposition, someone needs to be in charge of acting on the new
opportunities. For years, the U.S. Postal Service has struggled to balance its
190 ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION
finances as technology has changed the needs of customers for its services
(When did you last send anyone a post card?). In 2014, its inspector general
released a report arguing that the USPS should move into providing
nonbank financial services (bill payments, money orders, prepaid cards,
international money transfers, etc.) to its customers, many of whom are
underserved by traditional banks.15 The report was praised in the press, on
Capitol Hill, and even in the pages of American Banker.16 But more than
a year later, no action had been taken, despite support for the idea from
the American Postal Workers Union. A newly sworn-in postmaster general
had focused on the current value proposition (e.g., whether to trim Saturday
mail delivery), but no one appeared to be in charge of turning innovative
ideas for new customer services into a reality.17
Leadership tenures may be another important factor in value proposition
adaptation. As Henry Chesbrough has observed, many large firms
move their general managers in two- or three-year rotations among different
business units in order to develop their leadership and knowledge of
the whole firm. However, undertaking significant change to a unit’s value
proposition or business model often takes more than two years. These kind
of short-term leadership roles encourage managers to simply continue to
optimize the existing model rather than pushing the company to adapt for
the future.18
Allocating Talent and Treasure
Another key challenge for an organization seeking to adapt is the need to
allocate the necessary human and financial resources away from existing
areas of business and into new, unproven ventures.
New managers with appropriate skills and authority are often the driving
force behind new strategic direction. At the New York Times Company,
adapting the value proposition of its business for both readers and advertisers
required organizational changes as well. The company hired Alexandra
MacCallum, founding editor of the digital Huffington Post, to lead a unit
focused on audience development in an age of social media. Chris Wiggins
was named chief data scientist and assigned to help guide a burgeoning
engineering division. Its job was to harness data and analytics to help
inform decisions by both editors and publishers on the Times’ content, distribution,
audience, and new advertising products.
ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION191
Often, adapting a business’s value proposition requires changing the
lines of reporting of existing employees. When Facebook began its strategic
shift to focus on the best mobile experience for users and advertisers,
it had to redesign the organization chart for the company’s engineering
teams. In the old organization, the desktop team led the development of
each new feature, and separate teams handling mobile apps for iOS and
Android were left to play catch-up. To support the new strategy, all engineers
were reassigned to teams focused on a single Facebook feature (photo
albums, group messages, upcoming events, etc.) so they could build it for
both mobile and desktop from the very beginning.19
Financial resources must also be allocated carefully to support the evolution
to new value propositions. This often requires leveraging revenue
or assets from existing units to finance the launch of new ones. During
Williams’s strategic transition, the firm was simultaneously taking money
out of its existing pinball machine business and launching its first casino
games. Marvel Comics had to leverage its prized rights to its comic book
characters as collateral to secure funding for its move into film producing.
This kind of transition is critical. McGrath describes this as a process
of “continuous reconfiguration” of assets, people, and capabilities as businesses
adapt from one transient advantage to another.20
Avoiding Myopia
Perhaps the biggest challenge to adapting the value proposition of an organization
is that it requires looking beyond the conventional wisdom of
its current business. Bold new opportunities (like selling music as digital
files over the Internet rather than as physical products) can often provoke
a response of “That’s not how we do things around here!” To paraphrase
entrepreneur Aaron Levie, “Businesses evolve based on assumptions that
eventually become outdated. This is every incumbent’s weakness and every
startup’s opportunity.”21
Numerous psychological experiments have illustrated the power of
confirmation bias. When faced with new information, we have a strong
tendency to selectively notice facts that fit our preexisting theories of the
world and to discount or filter out the ones that conflict. Think of the pinball
machine industry. When computer games first arrived in arcades, pinball
machine sales actually improved temporarily because the new games
192 ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION
were bringing in more customers. It would have been easy for Williams to
have concluded that video games posed no threat to its legacy business.
Actually, that is what their competitors concluded; almost all of them vanished
while Williams was making its pivot to casino gaming.
Avoiding myopia requires a business to take the customer’s point of
view rather than its own. This kind of customer-centric thinking is difficult,
as an organization naturally focuses its energy and attention on its own processes,
strategies, and immediate self-interest. If a company has been making
encyclopedias for 200 years, it would be easy for it to focus on all the
hard work that goes into making them and to wish customers would just pay
for its new CD-ROM version rather than cultivating the perspective to see
that its CD-ROM isn’t really the best solution for those customers.
To cultivate the customer’s point of view, a business needs to institutionalize
listening to its own customers, particularly lead users (as discussed
in chapter 4). These avidly involved customers actually drive most
commercially successful new innovations because they tend to face new
needs earlier than the general population.22
The challenge, though, is often not in finding the right customers to
listen to but in keeping our ears open. My friend Mark Hurst has spent his
career trying to help companies develop customer empathy through direct
customer observation. “The difficult truth is that customers often bring the
bad news when something is wrong,” Hurst says. “Some executives simply
don’t want to hear it.”23
8
In a world of rapidly changing technology and customer needs, it is no
longer sufficient for a business to deliver the same value that has brought
it success in the past. A rapid pace of change demands that every business
continuously adapt how it serves its customers, what problems it solves,
and what value it delivers. By taking a truly customer-centric attitude, a
business can stay ahead of the curve of change. If it can learn to continuously
reevaluate the value it delivers, identify changing customer needs,
and spot emerging opportunities, it can continue to be the most valuable
option for its customers.
We have now examined all five domains of digital transformation. We
have seen, in detail, how businesses today need to think quite differently
about customers, competition, data, innovation, and value to customers.
By applying new tools and concepts to each of these five domains, any
ADAPT YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION193
organization can move beyond the assumptions of the analog age. By transforming
its strategic thinking across the five domains, any business can
adapt and create new value in the digital age.
But success in the digital age also requires us to prepare for the unexpected:
the most challenging ruptures and dislocations that can strike any
industry. This requires a clear understanding of what we mean when we
talk about business disruption. That concept is surrounded by many misconceptions.
True business disruption does not happen every day. But there
might be times when a business must face a truly disruptive challenge—an
asymmetric threat that radically undermines its current position, calling
into question its core value proposition and threatening to make it unattractive
to customers or, worse, irrelevant. In such times, that business
needs additional tools: a theory to understand the difference between competition
and true disruption, a rubric to assess any potentially disruptive
threat, and a guide to judge what the appropriate response is.
The prevailing theory of disruption, developed just as the Internet age
was dawning, was based in the prior revolutions of the late industrial and
early information ages. Successful leadership today requires an updated
theory of disruption for the digital age. That is the subject of the next and
final chapter.

Mastering Disruptive Business Models
There is a specter that lurks in the background of almost every discussion
of digital transformation. For many, the need to rethink and adapt
their organizations arises in response to a fear of a different, dire outcome:
disruption.
This concern is prudent. Even if your business absorbs the best strategic
thinking of the digital age and works diligently to apply it toward your
own strategies, no method is foolproof. It is still possible—in some cases,
even inevitable—that you will wind up faced with a truly disruptive threat
from an asymmetric competitor. It is critical, then, to be prepared to cope
with disruption.
In this last chapter, we will examine the nature of business disruption
and its relationship to everything we have learned about the five domains
of digital transformation. I will present two final strategic tools. The first
tool, the Disruptive Business Model Map, allows you to assess any emerging
threat to determine whether it truly poses a disruptive challenge to
your business. (Spoiler: in most cases, it does not.) If you are dealing with
a true case of disruption, the second tool, the Disruptive Response Planner,
reveals the full scope of the threat and helps you choose among the six
responses possible for an incumbent business under attack. In order to do
all this, we will first need to revisit the existing theory of disruption and
update it to account for the changed dynamics of the digital age.
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS195
Throughout this chapter, our understanding of disruption will be
informed by all that we’ve learned about the five domains of digital transformation—
customers, competition, data, innovation, and value. We will
see why disruption differs from most cases of innovation. We will see how
it is best understood as an asymmetric competition between business
models. We will discover why value proposition is an essential lens to
understanding and mastering disruption. And we will discover how platforms,
data assets, and customer networks are among the key drivers of
disruptive value in the digital age.
But to start, let’s be clear about what we are trying to understand when
we talk about business disruption.
Disruption Defined
The idea of disruption has grown in relevance as every industry faces increasingly
unpredictable threats. But at the same time, disruption has become a
buzzword, bandied about indiscriminately. Any new business or product
is heralded as disruptive to lend it credibility. (“You have to fund our new
start-up; it is going to disrupt the XYZ industry!”) Countless speeches have
been made exhorting entrepreneurs to be disrupters. At times, the rhetoric
seems to mistake the point of innovation, which is not simply to disrupt
existing enterprises but rather to create new value for customers.
If we are to inform our own business strategy by thinking constructively
about disruption, it is essential that we develop a clear understanding
of the phenomenon.
To start, let me offer a definition:
Business disruption happens when an existing industry faces a challenger
that offers far greater value to the customer in a way that existing
firms cannot compete with directly.
Let’s unpack that definition.
􀁲􀀁 Business disruption: We are talking specifically about disruption in
the sphere of business. I state this because the idea of disruption is
frequently applied to changes in culture, society, politics, and other
domains. For example, one can argue that the birth control pill was a
disruptive innovation in terms of its impact on social mores, marriage
law, and political ideologies. But it may not have transformed business
196 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
or industry. In a case like this, an innovation may be disruptive to society
but not be an example of business disruption.
􀁲􀀁 Existing industry: Disrupt is a transitive verb! In order for something
to be disruptive, something else must be disrupted. When we see a
radically innovative new business or product, we sometimes leap to
the conclusion of disruption before considering its impact on existing
industries. Think of the self-driving car first pioneered by Sebastian
Thrun and others in Google’s Google[x] division. A mainstream,
affordable self-driving car may soon be commonplace—and even
become the dominant mode of transportation within a decade or two.
If so, this will clearly be a transformative technology for drivers. But
it is less clear that self-driving cars will disrupt existing automakers.
So far, Google has shown little interest in entering car manufacturing
and is looking to partner with major automakers. Some of them, like
Toyota, are even launching their own parallel efforts in this area. It is
quite possible that self-driving cars will radically transform the experience
of driving and the world of transportation but do so without
undermining the existing automobile industry.
􀁲􀀁 Offers far greater value to the customer: Whenever disruption occurs,
it is because a new offering is suddenly much more attractive to customers
than the offering that the existing industry provides. Photographic
film maker Kodak did not collapse into bankruptcy because
digital cameras offered somewhat better value for consumers. It did so
because digital cameras—with nearly unlimited shots, instant display
of the picture taken, and free replication and transmission of images—
were vastly better than film cameras for the average snapshot taker. The
first thing that separates disruption from traditional competition is this
wide gap in value, which can lead to a tipping point when customers
shift en masse to the new offer.
􀁲􀀁 Cannot compete with directly: This is the other key distinction between
disruption and traditional competition. In traditional competition,
roughly similar businesses duke it out to offer the customer better
product features, lower prices, or greater personalization and service.1
When Ford Motor Company comes out with a faster, more fashionable,
or more fuel-efficient car, Chrysler redoubles its efforts to compete
on the same dimensions. When Macy’s draws traffic with holiday
sales, JCPenney does the same. When British Airways uses data to offer
more personalized service to its travelers, Virgin Airways may aim to
do the same for its customers. But disruption is different. Disruption
is caused by asymmetric competitive threats. A disruptive challenger is
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS197
not selling a different version of the same product or service. It meets
the customer’s needs with a product, service, or business model that
the existing industry does not, and cannot, offer.
The most important lesson to take from a clear definition of disruption
is this: not all innovation is disruptive. I stress this because many times
disruptive is used simply to mean “extremely innovative.” In fact, many
new business ideas create new customer value, and they do so by defying
common assumptions, or sacred cows, in their industry. But most of these
innovations don’t actually disrupt the preexisting shape of the market. The
result is a better product or a new brand but not disruption.
Take, for example, socks. In 2004, Jonah Staw and three cofounders
launched LittleMissMatched, a company selling socks by the threes, each
set intentionally not matching but with playful colors and patterns that
looked stylish when paired with each other. It was a new lifestyle brand
aimed at girls aged eight to twelve, and it went on to great success. The
socks were a brilliant idea, one that defied conventional wisdom and added
new value for the right customer. But they were not disruptive. The socks
were still manufactured, sold, distributed, priced, and used roughly the
same as other socks. So there was no hurdle to existing sock manufacturers
competing directly. Indeed, as LittleMissMatched proved to be a winner,
other brands copied the product idea.
Even an innovative business model is not necessarily disruptive—as
long as the jobs and revenues it creates are entirely additive to the market.
In their book Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne
describe how “value innovation” can be used to create new value and
growth by opening up new uncontested space; they use examples like
Cirque du Soleil’s invention of a new hybrid form of entertainment combining
circus and theater.2 In this and many such cases, the innovator is
not undermining an existing industry but simply carving out a new market
space (the “blue ocean”).
None of this is to dismiss the value of blue oceans, unconventional
thinking, or innovative products, services, or brands. It is simply to make
clear that innovation is not always disruption.
Disruption in the Digital Age
Now that we have an understanding of what we mean by disruption, why
does it seem to be on the rise in the digital age?
198 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
The answer is simple. As we have seen throughout the last five chapters,
digital technologies are rewriting the rules of business. These new rules
have created opportunities for countless new challengers to take on longprofitable
businesses that have failed to adapt. No industry is immune. If
the Industrial Revolution was about machines transforming nearly every
physical act of labor and value creation, we are still at the beginning of a
revolution in which computing will transform nearly every logical act of
value creation.
Marc Andreessen has famously said that “software is eating the world.”
He invented the first Web browser, the software that unleashed the Internet
as a network for mass participation. In chapter 6, we saw the existential
threat that it posed to the recorded music industry. Today, Andreessen
sees the digitization of every industry leading to ever more battles between
incumbents and software-powered disrupters.3
It’s certainly easy to find examples.
Think of Craigslist, the online classified service, and its impact on
newspapers’ business model. Traditional newspapers were very expensive
to produce. Certain sections, such as international news coverage, would
never pay for themselves if sold alone, but newspapers were always sold
in bundles so the more profitable sections could support the cost. One of
the most profitable parts of every newspaper was the classified ads, where
individual readers would pay to place a small advertisement announcing
items for sale (a used car, furniture, a television) or services (college
movers, lawn mowing). Then along came Craig Newmark, a software
programmer in San Francisco with the simple idea of using the Internet
to allow anyone to publish their classified ads for free. His small hobby
project was called Craigslist, and it quickly grew from an e-mail list into
a self-service website and a global enterprise that operates in seventy
countries and thirteen languages, with 50 billion page views per month.4
Craigslist’s success was inevitable. For customers, it offered a vastly better
deal than using newspapers: the ads were free to post (in almost all
categories), appeared instantly, and could be searched through a simple
interface. Newspapers, watching one of their highest margin sources of
revenue disappear, found themselves unable to do much but wish the
Internet had never been invented. Certainly, they could have created their
own free classifieds listings, but that would have done little to stanch the
loss of income. With their completely different cost structure, newspapers
were unable to compete with this disruptive challenger.
We’ve already seen the example of Airbnb, the software-powered challenger
to the traditional hotel industry. Rather than building expensive
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS199
properties and renting rooms to travelers, Airbnb provides an online platform
that allows homeowners to rent out their homes when they aren’t
using them and travelers to find them. With over 10 million guests per year
staying in more than 192 countries, the start-up surpassed InterContinental
Hotels Group and Hilton Worldwide to be “the world’s largest hotel chain”
without owning a single hotel.5 For many customers, Airbnb offers a much
better deal than a traditional hotel in New York or Paris—a better price,
more choice among neighborhoods, and a more “local” and personalized
experience. It is also a deal that hotel chains cannot hope to replicate, given
their investment in completely different business assets. Their best hope to
restrain the disrupter may be local governments, many of which are losing
tax revenue on these nontraditional hotel stays.
Another example can be seen in the category of restaurant food delivery
with the digital challenger GrubHub. For hungry residents in cities like
Chicago, New York, and London, GrubHub (and its local brands, like Seamless)
offers a great experience. Using a single, well-designed GrubHub app
or website, customers can browse numerous nearby restaurants, pick items
off their menus, and order for delivery with a preregistered credit card.
It’s a far superior experience to clicking through an assortment of badly
maintained websites, calling a restaurant, and dealing with sometimes poor
phone service. For individual urban restaurants, GrubHub’s platform offers
access to new customers and an online ordering system they couldn’t afford
to build themselves. But as its app becomes more popular and its power
grows, individual restaurants feel they have no option but to join up and
give a share of their already thin profit margins to the new digital platform.
Trying to compete directly with GrubHub is out of the question. Even if it
had the technical savvy, a single restaurant could never offer the variety of
GrubHub’s aggregated menus.
In each of these industries, a new digitally powered business has created
great value for the customer while weakening or undermining the position
of the traditional incumbent businesses. Although the digital challenger is
eating into their profits, traditional incumbents find themselves unable to
respond by competing directly with the same offer.
The exact strategy of the digital disrupter may vary. It may be offering
a new service for free, like Craigslist. It may use intermediation, like Grub-
Hub, to place itself between traditional businesses and the final consumer.
It may offer a substitute solution to a long-standing customer need, like
Airbnb does in place of a traditional hotel.
In every case of disruption, though, the challenge arises from a new business
offering new value to the customer. Incumbent businesses may wring
200 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
their hands and declare an unfair advantage for their challenger. But whether
the disrupter is a well-monetized new business (Airbnb is valued at over $10
billion) or not (Craigslist is run almost like a nonprofit), every disrupter is
creating new value for the customer. No one ever created a disruptive business
without creating an incredibly appealing new value proposition.
But is that it? Are we simply talking about new value propositions—or
something more? What really defines disruption? And can we model it,
understand it, and even predict it?
Theories of Disruption
The first major theorist of business disruption was the Austrian economist
Joseph Schumpeter. He didn’t use the word itself, but he wrote influentially
on a phenomenon he called “creative destruction,” whereby capitalism
inherently destroys old industries and economic systems in the process of
innovating new ones. In describing the arrival of railroads like the Illinois
Central to the midwestern United States, he wrote, “The Illinois Central not
only meant very good business whilst it was built and whilst new cities were
built around it and land was cultivated, but it spelled the death sentence for
the [old] agriculture of the West.”6
Schumpeter identified industry disruption as an inherent pattern in
capitalism. Successive cycles of capitalist invention birth new industries
while destroying their predecessors. But it was Clayton Christensen who
offered our first theory of how disruption happens and began to delve seriously
into its mechanisms. His brilliant and elegant theory of disruptive
technology (later redubbed disruptive innovation) was laid out in a 1995
article and subsequent book, The Innovator’s Dilemma.7
Christensen’s theory shows how disruptive challengers can unseat
long-standing incumbents. The disrupter always starts out selling to buyers
in a new market—that is, buyers who are outside the market of customers
currently served by the incumbent. This “new market” disrupter offers an
innovative product that is inferior in terms of performance and features but
is cheaper or otherwise more accessible to those who cannot make use of
the incumbent’s offering. The pattern that follows is predictable: the incumbent
ignores the challenger’s inferior product because its own customers
aren’t interested and instead continues to improve the performance of its
higher-priced products. Over time, though, the performance of the challenger’s
innovation gets gradually better while it remains much cheaper or
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS201
more accessible. At a critical juncture, the new technology becomes good
enough to be a viable alternative for the incumbent’s own customers, and
they begin to defect rapidly in favor of the much cheaper or more accessible
alternative. The incumbent, who has remained wedded to its long-standing
product and business model, finds it almost impossible to compete. Rapid
decline follows.
It is a powerful theory and one that fits uncannily well in cases from
many, many industries—computer hard drives, mechanical excavators,
steel mills, stock brokerages, printing presses, and more.
But as tech analyst Ben Thompson has noted, “Christensen’s theory
is based on examples drawn from buying decisions made by businesses,
not consumers.”8 In the mid-1990s (when Christensen’s book was written),
technology was mostly sold to businesses, not consumers. Not surprisingly,
this allowed for a very straightforward theory of disruption. Customer
motivations were driven by a few clear, functional attributes: price, accessibility,
and performance. Incumbent businesses were particularly blind to
new customer markets. Due to their B2B sales process (with a dedicated
salesforce visiting corporate customers), incumbents found it extremely
difficult to switch from serving their current customers to focusing on the
emerging customer populations that their disrupters served.
Its origins in B2B industries may be the reason Christensen’s theory
explains a great many cases of disruption but has missed others. Famously,
when Christensen was interviewed about Apple’s iPhone, he predicted that
it would fail to disrupt the incumbent mobile phone manufacturers like
Nokia. “The iPhone is a sustaining technology relative to Nokia. In other
words, Apple is leaping ahead on the sustaining curve [by building a better
phone]. But the prediction of the theory would be that Apple won’t
succeed with the iPhone. They’ve launched an innovation that the existing
players in the industry are heavily motivated to beat: It’s not [truly] disruptive.
History speaks pretty loudly on that, that the probability of success is
going to be limited.”9
After the colossal success of the iPhone, Christensen said that it had,
in fact, been a disrupter but that the incumbent was actually the personal
computer industry.10 This is an interesting point and is still playing out as
global PC sales have flattened and been overtaken by smartphones. But it
would be nonsensical to argue that Nokia was not disrupted by the iPhone
as well. The incumbent king of the mobile phone industry before the iPhone
was completely unable to match the new challenger; Nokia fell rapidly into
irrelevance, and its phone division was sold to Microsoft six years later.
202 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
But I don’t believe that Christensen spoke hastily or misapplied his
theory. Clearly, the case of iPhone versus Nokia didn’t fit his original model.
From the start, the iPhone sold to the kind of affluent, technology-adopting
consumers who were a mainstay of Nokia’s customer base. The iPhone
was neither cheaper nor more accessible than Nokia’s phones. It did not
start out performing at a lower level and gradually build up to overtake the
incumbent. So how did Nokia come to be so thoroughly disrupted?
I will attempt to answer that question by offering a new theory. My
aim here is not to replace Christensen’s theory but to extend it to account
for newer dynamics of disruption that are now visible in the marketplace—
disruption that is driven by consumer purchase behaviors, disruption that
starts with the incumbent’s core customers (rather than starting with new
markets), and disruption that is driven by values other than price or access.
As we will see, Christensen’s theory of new market disruption is actually a
specific case of the broader theory that I will present.
A Business Model Theory of Disruption
My theory begins with the assumption that the best lens through which
to view disruption is business models. Many of today’s biggest disrupters
are not introducing a new fundamental technology to the market (e.g., a
new type of hard drive or mechanical excavator). Instead, they are applying
established technology to the design of a new business model. (Craigslist
invented neither e-mail lists nor websites; GrubHub invented neither
e-commerce nor mobile apps.) Business disruption is, at its core, the result
of the clash of asymmetric business models.
As with disruption, business model is a term that has taken on varying
definitions with its growing popularity as a tool for strategy formation. I’ll
use the common definition: a business model describes a holistic view of
how a business creates value, delivers it to the market, and captures value
in return.11
A detailed business model may comprise several components. Alexander
Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur describe it as including nine “building
blocks”: customer segments, value propositions, channels, customer relationships,
revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships,
and cost structure.12 Mark Johnson, Clayton Christensen, and Henning
Kagermann define it in terms of four parts: customer value proposition;
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS203
profit formula (including revenue model, cost structure, margin model,
and resource velocity); key resources; and key processes.13
My intent is to use the business model specifically as a predictor of
business disruption, and for this purpose, the schema can be simpler.
Two Sides of a Business Model
For the purpose of understanding disruption, let’s split the business model
into two sides.
The first side is the value proposition—the value that a business offers
to the customer. Due to the extreme importance of value creation and its
role in business disruption, for this framework I’ll consider it on par with
all the other elements of a business model combined. I am not alone in this
priority: Johnson, Christensen, and Kagermann picked value proposition
as “the most important to get right, by far.”14 And although it is just one of
nine building blocks in Osterwalder and Pigneur’s first book, their next
book was focused entirely on value propositions.15
The second side of the business model is the value network—the
people, partners, assets, and processes that enable the business to create,
deliver, and earn value from the value proposition. This includes things
like channels, pricing, cost structure, assets, resources, and the customer
segments on which a business is focused. The term value network emerged
in the 1990s to provide a model of value creation that is less atomistic, less
manufacturing-oriented, and less confined inside the firm than the model
of value chains.16
A quick example: I often present this framework when teaching short
programs for international executives through Columbia Business School
Executive Education (often in partnership with leading universities in
Asia, Europe, or Latin America). I introduce it by asking the executives to
describe the value proposition of an executive program like the one they
are participating in: “What is the benefit you gain as a customer?” They
typically identify several things: cases studies and best practices, exposure
to new industry trends, and practical frameworks and tools—but also peer
relationships, access to faculty, the recognized credential of a certificate,
and a chance to step outside their daily rush for some big-picture perspective
taking. In any complex business, the value proposition will include
numerous elements such as these.
204 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
I then ask the participants about the value network: “What enables the
business school to create and deliver this value and to earn revenue from
it?” They typically point to the faculty, the campus (being in New York is
sometimes important), and the program development staff—but also the
brand name and reputation of the school, relationships with industry, a
network of partner business schools, and being part of a broader research
university. Each of these, in different ways, helps to make the value proposition
possible.
Once we can see any business model in terms of these two sides—
value proposition and value network—we are ready to apply them in a new
theory of how disruption happens.
The Two Differentials of Business Model Disruption
The theory of business model disruption is simply this: in order to disrupt
an existing business, a challenger must possess a significant differential on
each side of the business model:
􀁲􀀁 A difference in value proposition that dramatically displaces the value
provided by the incumbent (at least for some customers)
􀁲􀀁 A difference in value network that creates a barrier to imitation by the
incumbent
Business disruption happens when both of these conditions are met—
and only then.
Without the first differential, there is no disruption, just traditional
competition. If the challenger’s offer is merely incrementally better (slightly
better price, availability, simplicity, features, etc.), then there may be some
loss of business, but the incumbent can simply respond with normal competitive
tactics to catch up, close the gap, or minimize losses. For disruption,
the challenger’s offer must be dramatically better. For at least some types of
customers, it should be no contest at all to decide whether to switch to the
challenger. When local newspaper readers discovered Craigslist, the option
of instant, free online listings of their advertisements (as compared to slow,
expensive newspaper listings) was incontestably better. Not every traveler
wants to stay in an apartment like the ones they can find via Airbnb, but
for those who do, the various benefits (price, availability, choice of location,
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS205
personal interaction, and local flair) mean that a traditional hotel room
simply can’t compete.
Without the second differential, however, an incumbent would simply
be able to watch the success of an innovative new challenger and profitably
imitate it with a copycat offering of its own. An incumbent that gets
disrupted is unable to replicate its challenger for varied reasons, but they
all stem from the value network that the incumbent established in building
its business. For newspapers facing Craigslist, their high cost of operations
meant they saw no benefit in imitating a free service run by a small
group of iconoclasts who persisted for years with no revenue and never
attempted to build a large for-profit enterprise. For global hotel chains like
Hyatt, offering a bed-sharing service like Airbnb’s would make no use of
their real estate, confuse their brand image, irritate their partners (many
of the hotels are owned by franchisees), and draw even more tax scrutiny
from local governments than Airbnb has. In both cases, the existing value
network of the incumbent prevents it from imitating the appealing new
offering of its challenger.
Let’s look at both differentials in a bit more detail.
Value Proposition Differential
Every disrupter requires a difference in value proposition that dramatically
displaces value provided by the incumbent. That difference can come from
many possible sources, which I call value proposition generatives (a term I
am adapting from Kevin Kelly).17
Key value proposition generatives that are common to digital disrupters
include the following:
􀁲􀀁 Price: Digital business models often allow for the same product or service
to be offered at a substantially lower price.
􀁲􀀁 Free or “freemium” offer: Research has shown that free offers stimulate
many more customer trials than a low price, even a penny.18 Many
new business models add customer value with a freemium offer, where
some level of service is available for free but a premium paid version
offers additional benefits.
􀁲􀀁 Access: One of the most common generatives of a digital business model
is the ability to access content or services remotely, anywhere, any time.
206 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
􀁲􀀁 Simplicity: Many digital business models disrupt by removing friction
from the sales process, making decision, purchase, and enjoyment of a
product much simpler and easier.
􀁲􀀁 Personalization: Customers prefer to have more choices to pick from
(provided there are tools to assist) and the choice of a product or service
that fits their particular needs. Sometimes this personalization
occurs through recommendation engines like Netflix’s; in other cases,
a new business offers customers the chance to customize a product.
􀁲􀀁 Aggregation: Many platform business models add value by aggregating
many sellers for the customer to choose from.
􀁲􀀁 Unbundling: A lot of digital innovation involves splitting apart traditional
bundles—groups of products, services, or features that customers
needed to purchase together. The added value can come from
letting the customer buy only the part they need or from focusing on
and improving the one part of the bundle that matters most.
􀁲􀀁 Integration (or rebundling): In the opposite direction, businesses can
generate new customer value by bundling together services that are
currently separate. (Think of the first iPhone customers, carrying one
device rather than a phone, an MP3 player, and a personal digital assistant.)
The real value of integration comes when the various parts work
together in a seamless way that was not possible when they were separate.
(Think of how your address book, maps, calendar, e-mail, phone
calls, and texts all work together and interact in a smartphone.)
􀁲􀀁 Social: The ability to share the experience of a product or service with
others is increasingly valuable to many customers.
This list is not meant to be exhaustive. Other value proposition generatives
that may be less tied to digital technologies include purpose (e.g.,
how each purchase from Warby Parker or Patagonia supports a social
cause), authenticity (e.g., how Etsy allows shoppers to interact with and
buy directly from craft artisans), or freedom from ownership (e.g., how
Rent The Runway allows customers to rent a different designer dress each
time they go out rather than owning any of them).
You will notice that the generatives above arise from many of the
strategic concepts we have seen throughout the book—such as customers’
networked behavior, the path to purchase, the use of data for personalization,
and the aggregating value of platforms. All of them are applied in
the service of adapting or inventing new value propositions, the subject
of chapter 6.
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS207
Value Network Differential
Every disrupter also requires a difference in value network that creates a
barrier to imitation by the incumbent. Recall that the network includes
anything—people, partners, assets, processes—that enables a business to
create, deliver, and earn value from its value proposition. The differences
can be found by looking at many different elements—what I call value network
components.
Key components to consider in analyzing a challenger’s value network
include the following:
􀁲􀀁 Customers: The challenger may be pursuing different customer segments
or types than the incumbent currently serves.
􀁲􀀁 Channels: These may include retail or online distribution, direct delivery
to the customer, or distribution through intermediaries. (Is the
challenger using different channels to come to market?)
􀁲􀀁 Partners: These may include sales, manufacturing, supply chain, or
other key partners that are critical to the challenger’s offer.
􀁲􀀁 Networks: If the challenger has a platform business model, then an
established network of customers or partners may be essential to how
it delivers its offer. (This may include networks of consumers, advertisers,
app developers, etc.)
􀁲􀀁 Complementary products or services: The challenger may already provide
the customer other products or services that are essential to the
value created by its new offer. (Think of Apple’s iTunes music service,
which predated the iPhone and added to its value.)
􀁲􀀁 Brand: Reputation, brand image, and the prior relationship with the
customer may be essential to the challenger’s ability to provide the
value of its offer (and to charge the right price for it).
􀁲􀀁 Revenue model: This includes the pricing and profit margin as well as
the payment model. (Is the customer paying for the offer on a product
basis, per use, monthly subscription, revenue share, etc.?)
􀁲􀀁 Cost structure: This includes both the fixed and the variable costs incurred
by the challenger in order to provide its offer to the customer.
􀁲􀀁 Skills and processes: The challenger may have unique or differentiated
processes and organizational skills that are essential to the value it
delivers (from Apple’s design capability behind the iPhone to Zappo’s
highly developed customer service).
208 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
􀁲􀀁 Physical assets: These may include factories, equipment, stores, and so
on owned by the challenger.
􀁲􀀁 IP assets: Critical intellectual property may include patents, rights, licenses,
and unique technologies.
􀁲􀀁 Data assets: The challenger’s value proposition may rely on unique data
assets and capabilities, such as Amazon’s and Google’s use of their customer
data to deliver all kinds of personalized offerings.
The Two Differentials in Christensen’s
New Market Disruption
As mentioned earlier, Christensen’s original model of business disruption,
often called new market disruption, is actually a specific case of this more
general theory of business model disruption.
Within this new theory, Christensen’s new market disruption is simply
a description of all those cases of disruption where the value proposition
differential is a difference in price or access and the value network differential
includes a difference in customer segment (the challenger is pursuing a
different customer segment).
By expanding our model to include other differentials of both value
proposition and value network, we can account for and explain many additional
examples of business disruption, particularly those involving some
of the biggest disrupters of the digital age.
Digital Disrupters: iPhone, Netflix, Warby Parker
Let’s see how this model applies to three recent cases of business disruption.
All three are in consumer businesses, and the disruption did not follow the
traditional new market theory of disruption.
Two of the incumbents were completely disrupted and left the business
where they had recently been the market leader; one disruption is newer
and still ongoing. (As we shall see, a disruptive challenger does not always
spell doom for the incumbent.)
iPhone Versus Nokia
Why did Apple’s iPhone so thoroughly supplant Nokia’s mobile phones?
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS209
By looking at the differences in their value propositions, we can see
why customers quickly came to see the iPhone as not slightly better but
vastly better—no comparison at all, really. (See table 7.1.)
Certainly, one difference was in the physical design—the iPhone’s
shape, weight, and large glowing screen and the tactile experience of its
touchscreen provided a totally different customer experience. Simplicity
was another critical difference. Mobile phones in 2007 were notoriously
difficult to navigate, even for common features like managing voice mail
messages. The iPhone’s operating system offered a much easier user interface.
Another important difference was integration—rather than carrying
around a phone (for calls), a PDA (for address book and calendar), an MP3
player (for music), and a GPS device (for maps), the user had all these
integrated seamlessly into one device. Lastly, there were the apps—starting
with a Web browser and a few others and then exploding into thousands
of programs in the iPhone’s second year when Apple opened it up to outside
developers to create programs. The apps turned the iPhone into a true
computing device.
Why couldn’t Nokia compete? It was very clear within a couple of years
that the iPhone was a huge hit with enviable profit margins. But Nokia,
despite being the global leader in mobile phones (and valued at over $100
billion), was unable to imitate Apple’s success with a copycat smartphone
of its own. The reasons can be seen in the difference between the value
networks of the two companies.
Much attention is often paid to Apple’s highly developed design capabilities,
which were doubtless critical to the creation of the iPhone’s compelling
physical design and touchscreen interaction. But there were several
other differences in Apple’s value network that allowed it to create, deliver,
and monetize the iPhone. One was the partnership Apple had struck with
its retail partner, AT&T. This included a large price subsidy, with AT&T

covering most of the consumer purchase price of the iPhone and rolling it
into consumers’ (higher) monthly payments for data over two years. Without
this, the iPhone would have been so expensive as to remain a niche
luxury product. AT&T also offered unlimited data usage for a fixed price
in the early years of the iPhone; this led consumers to fully explore the
apps and features of the new device, thereby cementing radically new habits
and expectations for mobile devices. Other key elements of the iPhone’s
value network lay in Apple itself: its skill in designing simple computing
operating systems (from years of designing desktop computing products)
and its ownership of the iTunes music platform. Thanks to the iPod, Apple
already had the dominant digital music platform for U.S. consumers, and
who really wanted to buy their music all over again in a new market from
Nokia or anyone else? Lastly, once the App Store was opened up, explosive
growth in users and sales attracted an ecosystem of tens of thousands of
developers who learned to program apps for the iPhone. Nokia could never
program the same number of apps for any phone of its own and was badly
behind in the race to attract outside developers. Taken together, these differences
in the companies’ value networks made it impossible for Nokia to
imitate the iPhone’s strategy.
Netflix Versus Blockbuster
Let’s take a look at another recent case of massive disruption: how Netflix’s
original DVD service defeated the leading retail chain for movie rentals,
Blockbuster.
Blockbuster was an extremely entrenched and dominant player in the
retail space, so Netflix chose to compete by offering a dramatically different
value proposition to the customer. (See table 7.2.)

MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS211
The first difference was the elimination of late fees. In the retail model,
the customer picked up a movie and paid for a fixed number of days. If they
returned it past that time period, they were charged a late fee—aggravating
and unavoidable. But Netflix did away with the hated late fees entirely,
with a flat monthly fee that allowed the customer to keep three movies at
home at a time, exchanging them as quickly or as slowly as they wanted.
The product was also more accessible. Rather than going to a retail store,
the customer simply picked the movies out on Netflix’s website. A few days
later, they arrived in the mail, with a handy return envelope to send them
back. Because Netflix was shipping from centralized warehouses, it was able
to offer every customer 100,000 movies, a much wider product choice than
at any of Blockbuster’s retail stores. To help the customer choose among all
those (potentially overwhelming) options, Netflix’s website also offered a
sophisticated recommendation tool. The cumulative effect of these differences
in value proposition was that consumers who tried Netflix loved it,
never went back, and recommended it to their friends. Blockbuster quickly
realized it was a facing a real threat.
Why didn’t Blockbuster launch a copycat of Netflix—a mail-order service
of its own? Actually, it did. Once the threat of Netflix’s service was clear,
the retailer tried to launch its own mail-order service. The hurdles it faced
could have been predicted, though, by looking at the differences between
the two companies’ value networks. One difference was the pricing model
(subscription pricing vs. per product fees)—but that was easy enough for
Blockbuster to simply adopt as part of its copycat effort. The next difference
was Netflix’s website and recommendation engine. Although Blockbuster
could build an e-commerce website, it lacked the massive data sets as well
as the sophisticated technology assets to provide movie recommendations
as good as Netflix’s. Another difference was Netflix’s sophisticated warehouse
and mail distribution system. With great expense, Blockbuster was
able to build one of its own. But, critically, Netflix had spent years carefully
iterating and optimizing every aspect of its mailing system (including
the precise shape and size of the mailing envelopes and DVD sheaths)
to allow for maximum automation, minimum errors, the fastest possible
turnaround, and minimal cost. It was possible for Blockbuster to replicate
the delivery service—but not at the same price and with the same profit
margins. Lastly, a huge difference was that Netflix lacked the overhead costs
of running 9,000 retail stores. In the end, Blockbuster was able to offer a
roughly comparable value proposition to customers for a while, but it could
not do so profitably at the same customer price. After years of rapid decline,
Blockbuster closed its final 300 stores in 2014.
212 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
Warby Parker Versus Luxottica
Warby Parker is an American eyeglasses brand that is seeking to disrupt the
way prescription glasses and sunglasses are sold to consumers. The traditional
behemoth in this industry is Luxottica Group, which controls more
than 80 percent of major eyewear brands (including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Persol,
and licensed designer brands such as Armani and Prada).
Perhaps because of the highly consolidated market, the traditional customer
experience when purchasing glasses is far from inviting. Glasses cost
upward of $300, and buying them involves going to a retail store, placing
an order, and returning later for the product. Warby Parker offers its own
brand of fashionably designed glasses primarily through e-commerce sales
at a price of $95. To surmount the challenge of picking out glasses from afar,
the company allows consumers to select five frames to be mailed to them
free to try on. Once they choose the frame they like, the prescription lenses
are added, and the final product is delivered.
Does Warby Parker pose a disruptive threat to the incumbent? Let’s
take a look at the two differentials to judge (see table 7.3).
The biggest difference in Warby Parker’s value proposition is its price—
less than one-third the traditional price for the product. There is also a
potential difference in access: for consumers who want to avoid multiple
trips to a store or who don’t have many retailers in their area, the online
service may be another big advantage. (To appeal to customers in major
cities, the start-up has launched a limited number of retail stores and showrooms.)
In addition, it donates one pair of glasses, via nonprofit Vision-
Spring, for each pair that it sells to consumers. This and other social causes
(Warby Parker is a certified B corporation and 100 percent carbon neutral)
matter a lot to some consumers. So it would appear that, at least for

MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS213
some consumer segments (price sensitive, preferring to avoid retail hassles,
or favoring social cause brands), the company offers a dramatically more
attractive value proposition.
What about the value networks? Is there any difference that allows
Warby Parker to deliver this value? The first differences are its online sales
channel and its much lower retail costs. It also can keep prices low due
to its vertical integration (it owns the brand, manufactures the product,
and owns the entire sales channel). By contrast, Luxottica licenses many
of its brands, and although it owns large retail chains, it also sells products
through other retailers. It could certainly launch an e-commerce portal for
its own brands, but its cost structure would likely prevent it from coming
close to Warby Parker’s price. As a standard, publicly listed corporation,
Luxottica would also have difficulty matching Warby Parker’s level of support
for social causes.
Clearly, Warby Parker poses a disruptive threat for Luxottica—having
a much better value proposition that the incumbent cannot emulate. But it
is not yet clear how broad the disruption will be. Perhaps many customers
are willing to pay the higher prices for global brands like Prada, or prefer
to shop in a nearby store, or won’t care as much about carbon footprints
and donated eyeglasses.
These kinds of issues will determine the scope and impact of a disruptive
challenger like Warby Parker. Such variables can significantly affect
success. Let’s take a look at some of the key variables that impact the outcome
of business model disruption.
Three Variables in Business
Model Disruption Theory
The theory of business model disruption can identify and explain the cause
of disruption by a wide variety of challengers and in different industries.
But just because a challenger poses a genuine disruptive threat does not
mean that others in the industry are doomed. Incumbents may have some
choices in how they respond. And the nature of the disrupter itself—its
value proposition and its value network—can predict much of how the disruption
will play out.
Three important variables that complete the theory of business
model disruption are customer trajectory, disruptive scope, and multiple
incumbents.
214 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
Customer Trajectory
The first variable to consider in any case of business model disruption is the
customer trajectory. Which customers will provide the initial basis for the
challenger’s market entry, and are they already customers of the incumbent?
Business model disrupters can enter the market through one of two
trajectories:
􀁲􀀁 Outside-in: The disrupter starts by selling to buyers that are not currently
served by the incumbent (that are “outside” the incumbent’s
market), and over time, the disrupter works its way in until it starts to
steal customers directly from the incumbent’s own market.
􀁲􀀁 Inside-out: From the beginning, the disrupter starts by selling to
some subsegment of the incumbent’s current customers. This initial
subsegment may be small (sometimes the most affluent or the most
eager to try new things), but over time, it grows as the successful disrupter
expands outward to claim more and more of the incumbent’s
customers.
Christensen’s new market theory of disruption is based solely on
cases that follow the outside-in customer trajectory. Indeed, one of the
fundamental keys to his theory is that by starting outside the incumbent’s
customer base, the disrupter makes it very hard for the incumbent to
respond.
However, many cases of business disruption today take the opposite
customer trajectory: inside-out. All three of the cases we just saw were
inside-out cases. The iPhone did not start by selling to buyers who were not
previously in the market for a mobile phone. Rather, it began with a small
subsegment of the type of customers who would certainly have owned a
Nokia previously. At first, Nokia could reason that Apple was stealing a
profitable but small part of the market and that Nokia could aim to hold
on to the much larger majority of customers who were so far unwilling to
pay the higher monthly fees for a smartphone. But over time, the iPhone’s
customer base expanded outward to attract more and more of these customers.
Similarly, Netflix did not start by appealing to customers who had
never used video rental services like Blockbuster. Instead, its appeal was
specifically to those who had—pointing to their frustration with late fees
and promising a better customer experience. And Warby Parker obviously
had no option but to go after customers served by the incumbents like
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS215
Luxottica. If you didn’t already own or need prescription glasses, you were
unlikely to sign up for Warby Parker. The company’s rise may have started
with some of the more price-sensitive customers from the current customer
base (those who would give online ordering a try primarily for the $95 price
tag), but it then expanded outward as it proved itself capable of delivering a
true high-fashion brand as well as a superior customer experience.
Disruptive Scope
The second important variable in cases of business model disruption is
the likely scope of the disruption. There is sometimes an assumption that
whenever disruption occurs, the incumbent’s business, product, or service
will be replaced 100 percent by the disruptive challenger. Out with the
old, in with the new. In some cases, this does happen. When Henry Ford’s
mass-produced automobile arrived, it was only a matter of years before
the horse and buggy had basically vanished as a means of transportation.
(Kevin Kelly has argued persuasively that no technology ever disappears
from use entirely19—and, indeed, you can still enjoy a carriage ride around
New York’s Central Park as an expensive tourist treat.)
But in many cases of business disruption, the scope is not 100 percent.
Even after being disrupted, the incumbent’s product or business model
hangs on, confined to a diminished portion of the market but still a notable
player in the industry.
A recent example of this can be seen in bookselling, with the arrival
of e-books. Thanks to Amazon’s development of the Kindle e-book format
and electronic readers, consumers discovered they had a new choice
for reading. The e-book and its online bookstore offered many compelling
advantages: a lower price per book, a vast selection of choices, nearly
instant purchase and download, and the ability to carry hundreds of books
in your purse or bag at the weight of a paperback. The threat to booksellers
was clear: there is no need for a customer to walk into their local bookstore
to download an e-book.
In the first few years after the launch of the Kindle, e-books enjoyed
steady growth in market share. Many in the publishing industry looked at
that growth curve, projected it outward, and nervously predicted that in
a few short years, e-books would comprise the majority of book sales and
publishers would no longer be able to afford to produce print editions.20
But then something unexpected happened. After a spurt of rapid growth,
216 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
e-book sales leveled off. Various reports, confirmed to me by insiders in
the industry, say that the plateau was about 30 percent of book sales by
revenue.21 This was still enough to spark major disruption and shifts in the
balance of power in the industry. (Borders, one of the largest retail booksellers
in the United States, filed for bankruptcy in 2011.) Yet printed books,
while diminished, certainly did not disappear into obsolescence.
Although this surprised many observers, it was no fluke. In fact, I
believe that by looking at the behavior of book buyers, it would have been
quite easy to predict the scope of this particular disruption.
One important lens for predicting disruptive scope is the product’s different
use cases (as discussed in chapter 6). Customers buy books on a
variety of occasions, and they read books in a variety of settings. In some
use cases for reading, it is quite clear that the e-book provides a far superior
value proposition—for example, when you are going on a trip and would
like to have a variety of reading options but don’t want to be weighed down
by a bag of books. In other reading use cases, however, a printed book may
be better—for example, if you want to take notes in the margin or read on
the beach in direct sunlight (cases where e-book software and screens have
continued to lag the paper medium). We can also look at use cases for book
purchase. When the customer is seeking to try a new book while lying in
bed, there is no match for the benefit of being able to download a sample
chapter in seconds to their e-reader (and purchase the rest if they quickly
decide they like it). But what about gift giving? No one I have ever asked
has thought that an e-book was an acceptable substitute for a printed book
when giving a gift. This is not a small point: a large portion of book sales
takes place around holidays and other gift-giving occasions. If only a few
use cases favor the old value proposition, we might expect consumers to
sacrifice those benefits to shift entirely to a new value proposition. But in
cases like books, where the customer can easily alternate purchases of the
old product and the new one, it is predictable that we will wind up with a
split market—with some sales shifting to the disrupter’s offer and others
remaining with the incumbent.
In addition to use cases, the scope of disruption of a new business
model can be influenced by customer segments. Sometimes the disrupter’s
value proposition is highly preferable for some types of customers but not
for others with different needs. In the Warby Parker case, we may see that
certain eyeglasses wearers are likely to shift to its sales model, whereas others
(those that buy luxury brands and specialty lenses or those that have
better access to retail options) will stay with an incumbent like Luxottica.
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS217
Lastly, network effects can play an important role in determining the
scope of disruption. (This is particularly true for platform businesses, as
we saw in chapter 3.) If a disrupter’s product or service increases in value
as more customers use it (think of a platform like Airbnb, which relies on
ample hosts and renters), this will initially be a hurdle to the new business.
But it also means that if the disrupter manages to achieve a certain critical
mass of adopters, its continued growth is nearly assured, and it will more
likely end up with a very large share of the market.
Multiple Incumbents
The third variable to consider is multiple incumbents. A single disruptive
business model can actually disrupt more than one incumbent. By multiple
incumbents, I don’t mean similar companies in the same industry (e.g., the
iPhone disrupting Motorola along with Nokia) but entirely different industries
or classes of companies that are each challenged by the same new disruptive
business model. The iPhone posed a disruptive threat not just to
mobile phone companies (like Nokia) but also to desktop software companies
(as Microsoft discovered that Windows was no longer the world’s dominant
operating system) and online advertising companies (as Google had
to move rapidly to stay relevant as computing moved to the small screen).
Another interesting case of disrupting multiple incumbents can be seen
in the meteoric rise of online messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, WeChat,
LINE, and Viber (each of which has grown initially in somewhat different
global markets). Their full range of features may vary, but at their core, each
service has attracted hundreds of millions of customers with the ability to
send mobile messages for free over Internet connections rather than being
charged per message by the mobile phone’s service provider.
Obviously, one incumbent industry that is being disrupted by this business
model is telecommunications—companies like Vodafone and América
Móvil. For years, text messages had been a large source of revenue for these
companies. By one estimate, services like WhatsApp cost the phone companies
over $30 billion in texting fees in a single year.22
But telecommunications is not the only incumbent industry threatened
by the free messaging apps. When Facebook chose to buy the largest
one, WhatsApp, for 10 percent of its own stock (a $22 billion price), it was
not because WhatsApp promised to generate huge new revenues for the
social network. It was purely a defensive strategy against a new app that
218 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
was on track to attract 1 billion customers of its own. If consumers spent
more and more of their mobile screen time in apps like this one, they would
spend less time in the world of Facebook-driven socializing.
There may be another, even less likely industry that is being disrupted in
part by WhatsApp. A long article by Courtney Rubin in the New York Times
detailed the rise of mobile social networking (via text messaging, Instagram,
Facebook, and Grindr) in the social life of multiple American college
towns. Rubin’s ethnographic reporting uncovered a broad shift, described
by both students and owners of college bars. Each described how students
are spending less time and less money in the bars and coordinating more
of their socializing through mobile networking, with alcohol purchased in
stores and consumed in residences. College bars have always made their
money charging for drinks. But the value they provided to customers was
mostly the opportunity for serendipitous encounters and socializing. Now
students find they can get that through their phones and are showing up to
the bars sometimes only for a last drink before closing time (hardly enough
to keep a bar in business). Many college bars are struggling, and some that
have operated for decades are closing down. Yet another incumbent industry
has been disrupted by the rise of mobile messaging.23
Now that we’ve examined the theory of business model disruption,
how it expands on previous theories, and some of the key variables in its
application, let’s put it to work with two strategic planning tools. These
tools will allow businesses to gauge whether a threat they’re facing is disruptive
to their business and, if so, to assess its likely course and then select
among six possible incumbent responses.
Tool: The Disruptive Business Model Map
The first tool is the Disruptive Business Model Map. This strategy mapping
tool is designed to help you assess whether or not a new challenger poses a
disruptive threat to an incumbent industry or business.
If your business is the incumbent, you can use the map as a threat
assessor—to judge whether a challenger poses a traditional competitive
threat that you can respond to with traditional countermeasures or
whether it is a genuine disrupter. You can also use the map if your business
is a start-up or an innovator within an enterprise. As you develop new
ventures, the map will help you to identify the industries where you may
pose a disruptive threat and those that may be less affected or more able
to respond to your challenge.
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS219
Figure 7.1 shows the Disruptive Business Model Map. It includes eight
blocks, each of which you will fill out in making an assessment of a potentially
disruptive threat. Let’s look at each block and the question you must
answer to fill it in.
Step 1: Challenger
The first step of the Business Model Disruption Map is to answer this question:
What is the potentially disruptive business?
The challenger you identify here may be a new competitor to your own
established business. It may be your own start-up, attempting to disrupt an
existing industry. Or it may be a potential new venture or initiative within
your organization whose disruptive potential you are seeking to judge.
Note that we are not yet labeling this challenger as “the disrupter.” The
point of the map is to apply business model disruption theory to analyze
the challenger, incumbent, and customer to determine if there really is a
threat of disruption. In my experience running this scenario with numerous
executives—both to analyze existing threats and to test the market for
a proposed new venture—many challengers who have been dubbed disruptive
do not in the end pass the test.
In describing the challenger, you need to include its key offering: What
are its unique products and services? What is it bringing to the market that
does not exist yet? If your challenger were Netflix, you would include not
just the name of the company but also a description of the monthly subscription
service model that it is offering for movie rentals.

220 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
Step 2: Incumbent
The second question of the Business Model Disruption Map is, Who is the
incumbent?
You may choose either a category of related businesses (e.g., video
rental retail chains) or a leading example of the category (e.g., Blockbuster)
in order to make the analysis more concrete as you compare the business
models of the challenger and the incumbent.
The other key point here is that, as we have seen, a challenger may
pose a disruptive threat to more than one incumbent. Especially if you are
the challenger, you should try to identify multiple incumbents who may
be threatened by your new business model. Whenever you do identify
more than one possible incumbent, you should complete the map multiple
times—once per incumbent. You may well find that your new business
model poses a disruptive threat to one incumbent industry but that another
incumbent can accommodate the success of your model or can co-opt and
imitate it.
Step 3: Customer
The third question of the Business Model Disruption Map is, Who is the
target customer?
This is the customer being served by the challenger. In some cases, it
may be a direct customer of the incumbent, but it also could be another
key business constituency (e.g., a challenger could disrupt an incumbent
by stealing away all its employees). It is critical to state who the challenger’s
target is before you move on to the next stage to consider the value proposition
being offered to that target customer.
Once again, it is possible that a challenger could aim to usurp the
incumbent’s relationship with more than one type of customer. In this
case, you should also complete the map multiple times—once per customer
type.
Step 4: Value Proposition
The next question of the Business Model Disruption Map is, What is the
value offered by the challenger to the target customer?
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS221
It is very important to answer this question from the point of view of
the customer: What benefits do they stand to gain?
Remember, the aim here is not to describe the product or service
offered by the challenger (that should have been done in step 1). Nor it is
to describe how the challenger will get customers to pay it (the revenue
model will come in step 6, as part of the value network). The focus here is
exclusively on the benefit to the customer: What value could they gain from
the challenger’s offer?
You can refer back to the list of value proposition generatives earlier in
this chapter to consider some of the many ways that digital business models
provide value for customers.
Step 5: Value Proposition Differential
After you have described the challenger’s value proposition, the next question
is, How does the challenger’s value proposition differ from that of the
incumbent?
The point here is to identify those elements of the challenger’s value
proposition that are unique and different—this is the value proposition
differential.
There is certain to be some overlap between the values offered by
incumbent and challenger (e.g., Craigslist and newspapers both offer users
the same core benefit of being able to advertise personal items for sale to
a large local audience looking for them). You do not need to include those
commonalities here.
For some challengers, such as Craigslist, the differences in value proposition
may all be positive—that is, they are ways that the challenger offers
additional customer value. In other cases, the value proposition differential
may include benefits but also deficits, which you should indicate as such—
for example, for e-books as a challenger to print, you might indicate “less
easy to read in direct sunlight.”
Step 6: Value Network
The next question of the Business Model Disruption Map concerns the
value network: What enables the challenger to create, deliver, and earn
value from its offering to the customer?
222 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
You can refer back to the list of value network components earlier in this
chapter as you map out the value network that makes the challenger’s offering
possible. Your goal is to identify everything—people, partners, assets,
and processes—that enables the challenger to offer its value proposition.
If the challenger is new and unproven, this step should help to identify
unanswered questions about its business model and whether it will actually
be able to deliver the value proposition it is promising to the market.
Step 7: Value Network Differential
After you have described the challenger’s value network, the next question
is, How does the challenger’s value network differ from that of the
incumbent?
Again, there may be some points of overlap between the challenger and
the incumbent. If so, you can leave these out. The point here is to identify
those elements of the challenger’s value network that are unique and different.
Does the challenger’s offering rely on a unique data asset or on specific
skills that the incumbent currently lacks? Does it come to market via different
channels than the incumbent uses? Does the challenger have a different
pricing model or a different cost structure (e.g., less overhead costs for
retail space or staff) than the incumbent? Is the challenger launching with
a focus on a different market segment?
The set of all these differences between the challenger and the incumbent
is the value network differential.
Step 8: Two-Part Test
You are now ready to answer the ultimate question of the Business Model
Disruption Map: Does the challenger pose a disruptive threat to the
incumbent?
As described by the business model disruption theory, this question is
answered by a two-part test.
First, you need to assess how significant the differential in value is to the
customer. Is the challenger’s value proposition only slightly better than the
incumbent’s? Or does it radically displace the value of the incumbent? In some
cases, this could be because the challenger offers a comparable product or service
but with much better terms (think of Craigslist’s free version of classified
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS223
ads). In other cases, the challenger may solve the same customer problems as
the incumbent but also meet other customer needs at the same time (think of
the iPhone, which was both a great cell phone and much more). In still other
cases, the challenger may provide an offering that simply makes the incumbent’s
offer much less relevant to the customer (as mobile social networking
apps have made college bar rituals less relevant to American students).
The first question of the disruption test, then, is this: Does the challenger’s
value proposition dramatically displace the value proposition provided
by the incumbent? If the answer is no, then the challenger does not
pose a disruptive threat to the incumbent. The challenger may be a great
innovator with a terrific new value proposition for customers. But if that
offer grows to threaten too much of the incumbent’s business, the incumbent
should be able to respond by matching, or remaining closely competitive
with, the challenger’s value to the customer. If the answer to the first
test is yes, then you can move to the second test of disruption.
Here you need to assess the barriers that are posed by the differences
in value networks between incumbent and challenger. Could the incumbent
bridge these gaps, if it wished, so that it could deliver the same value
to customers that the challenger does? For example, could the incumbent
strike deals with channel partners similar to those employed by the challenger?
Could the incumbent eliminate any difference in its fixed costs or
compensate for them otherwise? Is it possible for the incumbent to overcome
the network effects that the challenger may have already built up to
its own benefit? Any major difference in value network could be the hurdle
that prevents the incumbent from responding effectively.
The second question of the disruption test is this: Do any of the differences
in value networks create a barrier that will prevent the incumbent from
imitating the challenger? If the answer is no, then the challenger does not
pose a disruptive threat to the incumbent. It may be a dire asymmetric competitor,
but there is no fundamental obstacle to the incumbent responding by
matching its strategy. The incumbent may have to sacrifice some of its current
profit margins in the process, just as it would in a price war with a traditional
competitor. But the challenger is not truly disruptive. On the other hand, if
the answer is yes, then the challenger has passed both tests of business model
disruption. The value it offers to the customer will dramatically outstrip or
undermine the value delivered by the incumbent, and the incumbent will
face intrinsic structural barriers that prevent it from responding directly. This
matches perfectly the definition with which we started the chapter: business
disruption happens when an existing industry faces a challenger that offers
224 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
far greater value to the customer in a way that existing firms cannot compete
with directly. The challenger is a disruptive threat.
8
But is all hope lost? In the face of a real disruptive threat, can the incumbent
expect complete and rapid extinction (like the horse carriage industry
facing automobiles), or is there an opportunity for the incumbent to
respond—or at least hold on to some of its glory?
That is where the next tool comes in.
Tool: The Disruptive Response Planner
If you have determined that you are, in fact, looking at a true disruptive challenger
to an incumbent business, you are now ready to apply the second tool.
The Disruptive Response Planner is designed to help you map out how
a disruptive challenge will likely play out and identify your best options for
response.
The first three steps help you to assess the threat from the disrupter in
terms of three dimensions: customer trajectory, disruptive scope, and other
incumbents that may be affected. You can then use these insights in the
last step to choose among six possible incumbent responses to a disruptive
challenger. (See figure 7.2)

MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS225
Step 1: Customer Trajectory
The first step in predicting the possible impact of a new disruptive business
model is to understand its customer trajectory: What customers are likely
to adopt the disrupter’s offer first, and how will its market spread from there
if it is successful?
OUTSIDE-IN OR INSIDE-OUT?
As we have seen, there are two types of customer trajectories for disruptive
business models: outside-in and inside-out. It is critical to start by
judging which of these paths your disrupter is likely to take in entering
the market.
Outside-in disrupters begin by selling to noncustomers of the incumbent
and then work their way inward to encroach on the incumbent’s own
customers. As described by Christensen, outside-in disrupters don’t appeal
at first to the incumbent’s customers because of their lesser features, but
they do appeal to customers who could not afford or access the traditional
incumbent’s services. As the disrupter improves, it begins to attract the
incumbent’s customers as well. Christensen’s theory has shown how industries
with barriers that exclude many potential customers—higher education,
health care, financial services—are ripe for disruption. As he and
Derek van Bever write: “If only the skilled and the rich have access to a
product or a service, you can reasonably assume the existence of a marketcreating
opportunity.”24
Inside-out disrupters follow a different path. They begin by selling to
a segment of the incumbent’s current customers and then work their way
outward to take more of its market. We have seen many examples of these:
iPhone versus Nokia (started by selling to existing mobile phone users) and
Netflix versus Blockbuster (explicitly marketed to existing movie renters
as a better alternative). Rather than starting out as inferior to the incumbent’s
offer but “good enough” for buyers who could not afford the incumbent,
these disrupters offer much better value from the beginning. These
are business model innovations that would quickly draw a competitive
response from the incumbent except that they rely on a value network that
the incumbent finds impossible to imitate.
226 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
WHO IS FIRST?
Once you know if the disruption will be outside-in or inside-out, you will
want to identify which specific types of customers will likely be first to
adopt the disrupter’s product or service.
For inside-out disruptions, you should ask these questions: Who
among your current customers would be most attracted to the disruptive
offer? Are there any hurdles to their early adoption (e.g., reliability is not yet
proven)? Are there some current customers for whom those hurdles matter
less (e.g., they are eager to try out new products or are less concerned about
established brands)?
For outside-in disruptions, you should ask these questions: Who is
currently most motivated but unable to afford or access your products
or services? Which of these hurdles (price or access) is the bigger barrier
for them? Which hurdle does the disrupter’s offer help them more to
surmount?
WHO IS NEXT, AND WHAT WILL TRIGGER THEM?
Once you identify the likely first customers for a disrupter’s offer, you
need to identify who will be attracted to the offer next. For insideout
disrupters, that is likely another subgroup of your customers. For
instance, if Warby Parker starts by appealing to the supporters of social
causes, will its next customers be tech-savvy eyeglasses wearers? For
outside-in disrupters, the key question here is this: When will the disrupter
“tip” from selling to noncustomers and start to reach your own
customers?
You also need to think about what will trigger these second-wave customers
to come on board. These triggers can often be other customers’
behaviors; wait-and-see customers, for example, may become interested
as they see others using a product, or they may be persuaded by word of
mouth. The trigger may be some further innovation by the disrupter, such
as dropping prices further or improving features or both. Or the trigger may
simply be visibility—as press coverage, marketing, or geographical distribution
brings the disrupter’s offer to the attention of the next wave of new
customers.
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS227
IMPLICATIONS
Knowing the likely customer trajectory has important implications. As the
incumbent, you need to know which of your current customers to keep
an eye on first to see if they defect. You must also know if the challenger
doesn’t need any of your customers to get started (an outside-in disrupter).
In that case, you should develop a strategy to compete for these same “outside”
customers, where the disrupter may grow first before moving into
your own market.
Step 2: Disruptive Scope
The next step in assessing the threat from a disruptive business model is
to consider its likely scope. This describes how much of the market (how
many customers) are likely to wind up switching to the disrupter once it
is well established. Disruptive scope can be predicted by looking at three
factors: use case, customer segments, and network effects.
USE CASE
You should first identify various use cases where customers purchase and
use your product or service. Make two lists: In what situations do customers
purchase your offering? In what situations do they utilize it? (There
should be overlap in the lists but also some differences.) Then, for each use
case on both lists, consider the disrupter’s value proposition. In which cases
is the disrupter clearly preferable for the customer? In which cases is there
an advantage for your offer?
As we saw in the case of e-books versus print books, a disrupter may
have a clear advantage for some use cases (e.g., boarding a plane with a
variety of reading material) but be at a disadvantage in other use cases (e.g.,
giving a gift to a friend). You should also consider whether there are costs
to multihoming (as discussed in chapter 3). How difficult is it for a customer
to buy from your business for some use cases and from the disrupter
for others? For readers, it is not that difficult to buy printed books as gifts
while keeping an e-reader stocked for their own travel.
228 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
CUSTOMER SEGMENTS
Next you should subdivide the customers for which you and the disrupter
are competing. Rather than seeing them as one monolithic group, try to
divide these customers into segments based on their shared needs. What
drives them to use this product category? What are their relevant needs?
(This may sometimes correspond to some of your use cases.) Then, for each
segment, consider whether the disrupter is extremely attractive in comparison
to your business.
Recall Zipcar (discussed in chapter 5). This on-demand car rental service
seemed to pose a disruptive challenge to traditional car rental companies
when it launched. Zipcar members pay a small monthly fee to have access
to any of the Zipcars parked in their metropolitan area. They simply look on
their phone app, walk up to a nearby car, and type an entry code into the keypad
lock on the car door. This self-service model appears much more convenient
than the customer service experience of picking up a car at a traditional
rental agency. But Zipcar never supplanted the traditional rental model for
most customers. It turns out that certain types of consumers (e.g., those in
dense cities with regular needs for short-term car rentals) were ideally suited
to the membership model. But other consumers (e.g., those in rural areas or
those with more infrequent rental needs) did not benefit as much from that
model. While expanding to four countries and nearly a million members,
Zipcar has stayed focused on college campuses and major cities.
NETWORK EFFECTS
The third factor to consider in predicting a disrupter’s scope is network
effects. Many services, especially platform businesses, become more valuable
with each new customer that participates. As more customers bought
iPhones, it became easier for Apple to attract more developers to create
apps for the platform. As more developers built apps, the advantages of the
iPhone versus an incumbent like Nokia grew as well. If you look at a cryptocurrency
like Bitcoin, there is certainly the possibility that it could disrupt
various incumbents that provide traditional financial services (credit
card payments, savings accounts, foreign exchange). But the biggest hurdle
to a currency like Bitcoin is that currencies are extremely dependent on
network effects. As long as few merchants accept Bitcoin and few other
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS229
customers are using it, the benefits to a new user are mostly hypothetical.
On the other hand, incumbents watching Bitcoin need to realize that
enough momentum in user adoption could quickly lead to a snowballing
effect (much like users flocking to a fast-growing social network such as
Instagram or Snapchat) that transforms it quickly from a curiosity to a
major disruptive force.
IMPLICATIONS
Now that you have examined use cases, customer segments, and network
effects, you should be able to make an informed prediction of the likely
scope of impact of a new disrupter. Broadly, we can think of three likely
outcomes of a disruptive business model. One is a niche case, where the
disrupter is attractive to only a very specific portion of the market. Other
disrupters may wind up splitting the market, with the disrupter’s and the
incumbent’s business models each taking large shares. And in cases of a
landslide, the disrupter quickly takes over the entire market, pushing the
incumbent into obscurity.
Step 3: Other Incumbents
We saw earlier how a single new business model can disrupt multiple
incumbent industries. When assessing a disrupter to your business, it is
easy to focus on its impact on only one industry (your own). But to understand
the competitive dynamics at work, it is critical to expand your reference
frame to consider other incumbent businesses and how they will be
impacted and respond to the disrupter.
VALUE TRAIN
The first place to look for additional businesses that may be disrupted is in
your own value train (as discussed in chapter 3).
Start by asking which product or service the disrupter most resembles.
For example, the product most like e-books would be printed books. You
can then look at a value train of everyone involved in delivering that product
or service—from the originator (authors), to producers (book publishers),
to distributors (book printers, distribution companies, and retail and
e-tail booksellers)—until the value reaches the final consumer. Then ask
230 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
which of these different types of companies may be disrupted if the new
business model is successful? For e-books, the answer would likely be retail
booksellers, printers, and distributors; authors and publishing houses are
most likely able to adapt to the new business model.
SUBSTITUTION
Another way of identifying additional incumbents is to think of products
or services for which the customer may substitute the disrupter’s offering.
Ask yourself two questions: If a customer starts spending more money on
the disrupter’s product or service, where else might they spend less money?
If the customer starts spending more time on the disrupter, where might
they spend less time?
Considering the early iPhone, you can easily see that if customers
spend money on an iPhone, they are less likely to spend money on a phone
by another handset maker like Nokia. (Digging deeper, you might determine
that if they spend more money on iPhone apps, they are likely to
spend less on other entertainment.) If you ask where avid iPhone users
spend their time, you might realize that they spend less time conducting
Web searches on their desktops (a hugely profitable business for Google)
and more time on mobile Web searches (much less profitable).
One other question about substitutes is worth asking: If the disrupter’s
current product continues to become much better in terms of performance
and quality, for what other products or services might it start to become
a substitute? Looking at the initial iPhone, it is possible to imagine that if
it continues to get faster, more powerful, and a bit bigger, it does indeed
pose a threat as a substitute for laptop computers, televisions, and other
categories.
LADDERING
The last way to identify more incumbents who may be impacted by a disrupter
is to look at both immediate and higher-order customer needs.
You start by asking these questions: What problem or need does the
disrupter solve or meet for its customers? Who else tries to solve that problem?
For example, looking at messaging apps like WhatsApp, you can see
that customers use them to meet their need for expedient text messaging
with friends (especially friends in different countries). That need was
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS231
previously met by telecommunications providers, which, as we saw, lost
billions of dollars in texting fees due to this disruption.
Next you can attempt to unearth higher-order customer needs through
a process known as laddering. In this market research technique, you ask
a customer a series of “Why?” questions to get at the reasons behind their
immediate motivations. For example, if you ask college students why they
use WhatsApp, they might say “to message easily with my friends.” If you
ask why they use it for that, they might say “to be able to make plans and
swap photos.” If you ask why that matters, they might say “so we can meet
up and find out wherever the cool get-togethers are happening.” This might
lead you to realize that mobile messaging apps are meeting the need for
convening social interactions, which was formerly met by visiting the college
bar. This kind of laddering can reveal products or services that are
made less necessary for customers by the disrupter, even though the disrupter
doesn’t appear to be competing directly.
IMPLICATIONS
By looking at value trains, different means of substitution, and different levels
of customer needs, you may have identified multiple incumbents—types
of companies that will be disruptively challenged by the same new disrupter.
As an incumbent, it is always valuable to know who else may be threatened
by the same disrupter that is threatening you. In planning your own
response, it is important to see how these other incumbents are responding
or consider how their responses might parallel yours. You may also find that
these “enemies of my enemy” could serve as allies in response to the disruptive
threat. As described above, Google saw that it was threatened just as
much by the rapid rise of the iPhone as were cell-phone handset makers. As
we will see, this led to Google’s choice of response to the disruptive threat.
Step 4: Six Incumbent Responses to Disruption
The final step of the Disruptive Response Planner is to plan your response
as an incumbent. To do so, you will use what you have learned regarding
the trajectory, scope, and other incumbents of the disrupter you are facing
to help you choose which strategic responses are most promising for your
circumstances.
232 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
As an incumbent, you have six possible responses when faced with a
disruptive challenger:

􀁲􀀁 Split the disrupter’s business model
THREE STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE LOSSES FROM THE DISRUPTER
􀁲􀀁 Refocus on your defensible customers
􀁲􀀁 Diversify your portfolio
􀁲􀀁 Plan for a fast exit
These six strategies are not exclusive; you can combine them (and, in fact,
some of them work best together). The first three responses seek to occupy
the same ground as the disrupter. The last three responses seek to reduce
its impact on your core business. Depending on your own circumstances,
only one or a few of these incumbent responses may be workable, so it is
best to be familiar with each of them.
Let’s look at each response and see where and how you might best
apply it.
ACQUIRE THE DISRUPTER
The most direct response for an incumbent faced with a disruptive challenger
is to simply acquire the challenger. This is how Facebook dealt with
the challenge of WhatsApp. When Google’s Maps product faced a potential
disrupter in Waze, it bought the company. When the car rental giant Avis
saw that Zipcar had invented a disruptive business model, Avis also bought
its challenger. If you are considering buying your disrupter, knowing who
the other incumbents are will help you predict who else might compete
with you to drive up the price.
If you do acquire your disrupter, you should continue to run it as an
independent division. That’s what Facebook, Google, and Avis did in all
the above cases. That means the disrupter you own will continue to steal
customers from your core business (and possibly at a lower profit margin).
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS233
But if you don’t take measures to keep the acquired disrupter independent,
you will inevitably put the interests of your core business above the goal
of serving your customers. And that will create an opportunity for someone
else to launch a similar business and steal away your disappointed
customers.
Acquiring the disrupter is not always possible. A start-up with sufficient
venture capital may refuse to sell, as was the case with Facebook’s
failed $3 billion bid for messaging app Snapchat. Or the disrupter may be
part of a bigger company than the incumbent. Amazon’s e-books posed a
clear disruptive threat to retail booksellers like Barnes & Noble, but the
retailers were much smaller than Amazon (for whom e-books was just a
part of its business).
Often, acquiring the disrupter is overlooked or rejected in the early
stages, when acquisition is still an option. In 2000, shortly after Netflix
launched its subscription DVD model, the start-up’s CEO, Reed Hastings,
flew to Dallas to meet with Blockbuster’s CEO, John Antioco. Hastings proposed
the video giant and the newcomer form a partnership, with Netflix
handling online distribution and Blockbuster the retail channel. Hastings
was laughed out of the office.25 Blockbuster didn’t get a second chance.
Acquisition does not always need to be 100 percent (a partnership with
Netflix would have proved a godsend for Blockbuster), but it does require
swallowing your pride and recognizing the disrupter’s advantages before it
scales so big as to no longer need your help.
LAUNCH AN INDEPENDENT DISRUPTER
The second incumbent response is to launch a new business of its own
that imitates the business model of the disrupter. Instead of purchasing the
disrupter outright, the incumbent leverages its scale and resources to try to
beat the disrupter at its own game. This is the response Christensen proposes:
“Develop a disruption of your own before it’s too late to reap the
rewards of participation in new, high-growth markets.”26
In order to launch your own disrupter, however, you, the incumbent
must be willing to cannibalize your own core business. After all, you are trying
to re-create the very business model that is disruptively attacking your
traditional business. Charles Schwab implemented this strategy when it saw
the growth of online brokerages like Joe Ricketts’s TD Ameritrade, launching
its own online service that competed with its full-service offerings.
234 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
This strategy again requires you to keep the new disruptive initiative
walled off in an independent part of your company. You should run it on
its own P&L, with no responsibility to save or support your core business.
Although the independent unit should have access to some of the main
company’s resources, it should maintain a small and lean organization so
that it can evolve quickly rather than becoming a sclerotic version of the
nimble disrupter it is trying to beat.
You may even launch an independent disrupter preemptively—as you
see a possible new business model based on emerging trends and technology.
Saint-Gobain, a leading global retailer of construction materials,
looked at the trends in e-commerce and recognized the opportunity for an
online store in its industry. Rather than waiting for a start-up to capture
this opportunity, Saint-Gobain launched Outiz, an online-only retailer in
the French market. Outiz has been tasked with competing directly with the
parent company’s own brick-and-mortar retail brands.
Launching an independent disrupter is not easy, but it is plausible if the
differences in value networks are your company’s organizational culture,
cost structure, revenue model, and customer segments. You can potentially
overcome these kinds of barriers by insulating the self-launched disrupter
from the rest of your business.
SPLIT THE DISRUPTER’S BUSINESS MODEL
What if the incumbent lacks some core capabilities—like intellectual
property, brand reputation, essential skills, or the right partners—that are
needed to re-create the disrupter? In that case, simply insulating a new initiative
from the rest of the organization is not sufficient. But the incumbent
may still be able to re-create the disrupter’s business model by splitting the
job with other businesses.
This may be a good strategy if your prior analysis uncovered multiple
incumbents and their value networks are complementary to your own. This
was the strategy used by Google when it launched the Android operating
system in response to Apple’s iPhone, which was threatening its advertising
business. Google already had a core mobile operating system from its 2005
acquisition of Android Inc. It also had the key software assets required for
an iPhone-like device: Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube video, and
the Chrome Web browser. But Google knew it lacked the skills and assets
required to design and manufacture hardware to compete with Apple, so it
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS235
licensed its operating system and mobile software to diverse companies—
Samsung, Sony, HTC, and others—with the capabilities to build great
smartphone hardware. By splitting the iPhone’s business model with these
firms, Google was able to bring Android phones to market with a value
proposition that rivaled that of the iPhone.
The key to splitting a disrupter’s business model is to find other businesses
that complement your own value network and partner with them to
bridge the gaps that are preventing you from launching your own disrupter.
Ideally, those partners are also threatened by the same disrupter, so they
will be motivated to collaborate.
REFOCUS ON YOUR DEFENSIBLE CUSTOMERS
Incumbents don’t have to react just by becoming the disrupter; they can also
act defensively in shoring up their own core business. That is the focus of
the next two incumbent responses. These strategies can often be deployed
in combination with the previous ones.27
The first of these defensive strategies is to refocus the incumbent’s core
business on those customers it has the best chance of retaining. You should
use this strategy whenever you have identified a likely split market or niche
market for your disrupter.
It is essential that you not engage in wishful thinking and simply continue
to invest in your traditional business as if its future will look the same
as its recent past. Refocusing should appeal to the customers that you think
are most likely to stay with you despite the disrupter. Remember, they won’t
stay with you out of loyalty; they will stay because your business model still
offers more value to them. Look back at your scope analysis and the customer
segments and use cases that favored your product. Look also at the
customer trajectory you predicted: Who will likely depart for the disrupter
first, and who may follow? Then plan to shift your core business to focus on
them, even while that business is likely shrinking.
When book retailer Barnes & Noble found its business disrupted
by online book delivery, it refocused its business model on high-margin
products like children’s books and coffee-table books because the customers
buying these still valued the ability to browse the products in a store
environment.28
In refocusing your core business, you should aim your marketing,
messaging, and continued product innovations at these most defensible
236 MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS
customers. If your strategy involves cutbacks, focus on reducing the operations
serving those customers that you are likely to lose and on continuing
to deliver value to those you are likely to retain.
DIVERSIFY YOUR PORTFOLIO
The next way that incumbents can mitigate the disruption of their core
business is by diversifying their portfolio of products, services, and business
units. They can accomplish this by repurposing the firm’s unique skills
and assets in new areas and by acquiring smaller firms in the areas into
which they want to extend.
When digital photography was going mainstream and disrupting the
business of photographic film, the top two incumbent businesses were
Kodak and Fujifilm. While Kodak slid into a long decline that ended in
bankruptcy, Fujifilm managed to adapt and survive. “Both Fujifilm and
Kodak knew the digital age was surging towards us. The question was, what
to do about it,” said Fujifilm’s CEO, Shigetaka Komori. “Fujifilm was able
to overcome by diversifying.” Under Komori’s leadership, the firm spent
years applying its technical expertise in chemicals, developed in producing
film, in diverse areas such as flat-panel electronic screens, drug delivery,
and skin care. By the time Kodak filed for bankruptcy, Fujifilm’s film business
was only 1 percent of its revenue, but health care and flat-panel displays
were 12 percent and 10 percent, respectively.29
Diversification allows you to leverage the strengths in your value network
in new business areas, and although these areas may not initially be
as profitable as your core business, they can create new opportunities for
growth and make your firm less susceptible to total disruption.
PLAN FOR A FAST EXIT
The last strategy for an incumbent response to disruption is the least
desirable one. When a disruptive challenger poses an irresistible threat
to an incumbent’s entire market and there is no feasible way to launch a
disruption of its own, the incumbent needs to plan for a fast exit. This is
the case when the disruptive scope is a landslide because all customers
and use cases are vulnerable or because strong network effects lead to a
winner-take-all scenario.
In planning to exit a market, you should assess all your firm’s assets,
especially intangible assets (patents, brand names, etc.) that can be sold.
MASTERING DISRUPTIVE BUSINESS MODELS237
You may also choose to spin off the indefensible part of your business from
other divisions that can survive on their own rather than letting the vulnerable
part bring down your entire enterprise. In most cases, you can pursue
one or a combination of the first five incumbent responses, but sometimes
an orderly liquidation of assets is the necessary call.
Beyond Disruption
The fact of disruption is inescapable. The very strategies that comprise
the digital transformation playbook for traditional enterprises are also the
source of their biggest disruptive threats. And yet disruption is both more
and less than it seems.
Disruption is more diverse than our prevailing theory has held.
Disruption is driven by more than just lower prices and accessibility for
new customers; it can be triggered by any dramatically greater value proposition
for the customer. Disruption can happen not just on the familiar
trajectory of outside-in but from inside an existing market outward as well.
But disruption is also less than we sometimes imagine it to be. First and
foremost, not every innovation (no matter how breathtaking) is necessarily
a disrupter of an existing industry. Disruption is rarely total; most disrupters
attract a significant part of an incumbent’s market without taking 100
percent. Disruption is also less than irresistible. Even though it may pose
an existential threat to an incumbent’s business model, there are strategies
the incumbent can use to adapt, diversify, and continue its enterprise by
adding new value for customers.
More than anything else, responding to disruption requires that a business
be willing to question its own assumptions and focus on the unique
mission of how it serves customers.

Conclusion
Digital transformation is fundamentally not about technology but about
strategy. Although it may require upgrading your IT architecture, the more
important upgrade is to your strategic thinking.
Traditionally, digital leaders, such as CIOs, were tasked with focusing
on automating and improving the processes of an existing business. Today,
digital leadership requires the ability to reimagine and reinvent that business
itself. What business are you in? How do you create value for customers?
What do you keep inside the borders of your organization, and what
processes, assets, and value should reside in your relationships outside?
How do you balance your relationships with customers and other organizations
to ensure profitability, sustainability, and growth?
Reimagining your business requires challenging some of its underlying
core assumptions. It requires recognizing blind spots you may not realize
you have. It requires thinking differently about every aspect of your
strategy—customers, competition, data, innovation, and value. This kind of
rethinking is difficult—but certainly possible. Just as factories built before
the era of electrification were able to revamp their entire way of working
and manufacturing, businesses today that were born before the Internet are
quite capable of transforming for the digital age.
240 CONCLUSION
So why don’t more businesses do this successfully? The sober truth is
that for every Encyclopædia Britannica that succeeds in transforming for
the digital age, there is a Kodak or a Blockbuster that fails. Why are so many
of our institutions struggling to adapt and keep up?
One of the key reasons is organizational agility. It is not enough just to
recognize and overcome your strategic blind spots—or even to see how the
principles of digital transformation apply to your own industry and business.
Legacy organizations must be ready to make change happen—and at
a very rapid pace. The curse of successful enterprises is often their very size
and scale: their enviable resources can become a trap as future decisions are
held hostage by past success.
To develop true organizational agility, your business needs to focus on
three areas:
􀁲􀀁 Allocating resources: How will you decide what to invest in? Are you
able to disengage from initiatives and lines of business that lack future
potential? Can you apply resources from older business lines to support
new ventures?
􀁲􀀁 Changing what you measure: What outcomes are being measured by
senior decision makers? Do they simply relate to existing business
practices, or can they support new directions? What should you be
measuring at different stages of a transition to a new business model?
􀁲􀀁 Aligning incentives: What kind of behavior is enabled, supported, and
rewarded in your organization? What are managers held accountable
for? How are they assigned to new positions? Do compensation and
recognition support or hinder the necessary changes in your strategy?
It may be helpful to conduct an audit of your business’s readiness for
digital transformation. At the end of this book, you can find such a diagnostic
tool, titled Self-Assessment: Are You Ready for Digital Transformation?
It includes questions to assess your own organization’s current readiness
for digital transformation—in terms of both strategic thinking and agility
to carry out new strategies.
You can think about the challenge of digital transformation in terms
of mastering two different kinds of management. To succeed in any transformation,
your organization must be able to develop truly new ideas, processes,
ventures, and ways of thinking. But it must also be able to spread
these ideas or processes throughout the organization. This is quite a different
task—and one that is particularly hard for large organizations.
CONCLUSION241
The head of British Airways’ Know Me program explained to me how
the company is tackling this transition. Having built a powerful data asset,
developed tools to capture customer insight and apply it in customer interactions,
and launched pilot programs to prove the impact for the business,
she now faces a different challenge. The next stage is to scale up the program,
to embed the use of data for customer service into the company’s
DNA, and to transition Know Me from an innovative initiative to a part of
British Airways’ day-to-day operations.1
My colleague Miklos Sarvary, who teaches in my digital strategy executive
programs at Columbia Business School, talks about this transition as a
shift from “incubation” (seeding and nurturing new strategies) to “integration”
(building the best ones into the fabric of the organization).
But incubation and integration require very different skills in an organization.
The ability to incubate is seen best in start-ups and venture capital
firms. It relies on specific skills: tolerating risk, seeding diverse ideas with
resources, welcoming outsiders who don’t fit your organizational culture,
empowering entrepreneurs, developing a robust innovation process based
on discovery and assumptions testing, maintaining a customer-centric
view, and being willing to let new ventures cannibalize existing ones.
By contrast, the ability to integrate and replicate successful ideas at
scale is most often seen in larger enterprises. It involves a different set of
skills: building a compelling business case, developing a clear proof of concept,
selling new ideas to diverse internal constituencies, finding the right
executive sponsorship, working with budgets based on business outcomes,
managing accountability to multiple stakeholders, and being able to scale
up operations.
The organizations that flourish in the digital age will combine the right
strategic mindset with the right leadership skill set. They will understand
the new strategic fundamentals of the digital age and use them to craft new
products, services, brands, and business models. Whatever their size, they
will maintain the organizational agility to seize new opportunities, and they
will balance the art of incubating and learning like a start-up with the art of
scaling and integrating like an enterprise.
These organizations will be guided, as their strategies and business
models change, by a focus on continuous value creation. Going back to
Peter Drucker, management thinkers have argued that the true and ultimate
purpose of business should always be creating value for the customer:
“to create a customer,” as Drucker wrote,2 or “to get and keep a customer,” as
Ted Levitt put it.3 Today, though, this doctrine may require a slight update.
242 CONCLUSION
Amidst constant digital change, no business can thrive for long just delivering
the same value proposition to customers. The need for value creation
is now intertwined with the need to constantly relearn and reinvent what
that value will be. The purpose of business, then, may be thought of as the
continuous creation of new value for the customer.
The digital revolution is still just getting started. With an ever-unfolding
cascade of new technologies and all the potential they provide, it is
impossible to predict how the digital future will impact your business or
any industry. But if you are savvy, your business can choose to use each new
wave of change as an opportunity to create new value for your customers.
Onward!

and overtaking even 100-year-old enterprises with breathtaking
speed. By the same token, every single company will be affected by this development,
and every single business model will wind up being put to the test – by new
and often very young competitors.
Anything that can be digitized will be digitized, and anything that can be
networked will be networked. This applies to people, machines, and products
alike. Software is increasingly becoming a decisive production factor, because all
of these networked machines must be controlled and all the digital data must be
stored, processed, and meaningfully analyzed. So the successful companies of
today also have to be – or become – “software companies.” And software lives in
the cloud.
Digital Transformation Is an Imperative
This book aims to explore what this development means to the business leaders of
today – whether they are at the head of a start-up or a long-established company.
One thing is certainly clear: Digital transformation is now essential to corporate
growth. What’s more, Europe’s future prosperity depends on successful digitalization.
Until now, however, most of the biggest digital success stories have taken
place in the USA and Asia. Europe in general, and Germany in particular, must not
get left behind here. As a classic industrialized nation and the land of the post-
World War II economic miracle, we have great opportunities available to us. But
we have to seize them. Now.
Some of the foundation stones for this success have already been laid. Back in
2012, digitalization triggered a growth momentum of around 145 billion euros in
Germany (cf. Bitkom 2014). A few companies were quick to take advantage of
digitalization. The German mail-order company Otto is one example. Thanks to
v
digital transformation, this long-established firm moved on from traditional catalog
sales and developed into Germany’s largest online retailer for lifestyle products.
Otto now sells more furniture online than IKEA (cf. dpa 2015). ING-DiBa is
another digital success story. Operating not even a single branch office, this
financial institution – which now has more than eight million customers – made
the leap to become Germany’s largest direct bank by far (cf. Fr€uhauf 2014) and the
third-largest retail bank in Germany.
This goes to show that successful digital business models are out there. But that’s
only the beginning. The strategy consultancy Roland Berger foresees an additional
cumulative potential value of 425 billion euros in Germany by the year 2025 if
German industry succeeds in its digital transformation. For Europe as a whole, the
researchers have forecast extra potential value of 1.25 trillion euros. But they also
point out the danger of missed opportunities: If digital transformation fails, it could
lead to potential losses of up to 605 billion euros in Europe (cf. Kurzlechner 2015).
This can’t be allowed to happen.
Many managers are already aware that now is the time to get things on track.
Nearly one in two German companies is preparing itself for the fact that new
technologies will eventually call its own business model into question (cf. Ernst
& Young 2015). And it’s true. Digitalization requires us to rethink – or at least
rework – our current business models. But digitalization can also give rise to
entirely new and disruptive approaches. What many successful young companies
have in common is their consistent focus on customer value and the use of superior
software platforms which enable them to attract a very large number of customers
very quickly. This is how Airbnb became the largest hotel provider without owning
a single bed of its own, and how Uber became the largest taxi company without
owning a single vehicle.
Digital Transformation Is a Management Issue
The examples reveal something else as well: The pace at which companies must
respond to new demands continues to grow. There was a time when the average life
expectancy of a company was 75 years. Now it’s just 15 (cf. Hagel III 2010). And in
more and more cases, the lack of a digitalization strategy is the deal breaker. Take
Kodak, for instance: The camera and photo specialist once had 140,000 employees
and annual sales of around 28 billion US dollars. Kodak missed out on the digital
transformation and ultimately had to file for bankruptcy. Parallel to this, a software
company named Instagram became the world’s largest digital photo-sharing app –
with just 13 employees. When Instagram was sold to Facebook in 2012, it cost one
billion dollars (cf. Thun 2014).
Digitalization is not purely an IT issue. It is strategically important and critical to
business. In light of this, when it comes to the digitalization of production processes
(what are known as “Industry 4.0” applications), the management or executive
board is usually responsible for handling things (cf. Bitkom 2015). Digitalization
has become a management issue – as it should be.
vi Foreword
Incidentally, this applies to big businesses as well as mid-sized companies – the
so-called Mittelstand – which are the backbone of German industry. German
Chancellor Angela Merkel thinks the issue is not yet anchored deeply enough in
many small to medium-sized enterprises (cf. Fietz 2015). She has also stressed that
just appointing an IT officer is not enough, because the impetus has to come from
the management. And she is right – after all, CEOs are the ones who must make sure
their companies are agile enough to anticipate changes and react to them quickly.
The CEO has to establish the parameters for digitalization so that the IT department
can cope with the new requirements.
Digital Transformation Requires the Cloud
Speed and agility are key when it comes to introducing new products and processes.
Cloud computing is the technological basis for this. The cloud is what makes it
possible to achieve the high velocity demanded in this age of digitalization. It
makes the necessary services faster, more flexible, and more secure.
The question is no longer whether the cloud should have a place in a company’s
strategy – the question is about the form and scope of that place. Integrated ICT
providers are the obvious partner here because cloud computing requires both
technological foundations and consulting expertise – “hardware” and “software,”
if you like. One essential component of this is a strong broadband network for fixed
lines and mobile communication – ideally transnational, pan-European, and all-IP.
This calls for IT security which is “made in Germany” and hosted in highly secure
data centers. But it also calls for sophisticated IT quality management, which is
vital in the digital world, coupled with the relevant experience in digital
transformation.
Ultimately, every company has different requirements and different goals which
must be continuously adapted to the market conditions. An ICT partner is therefore
like a company’s “architect of the digital future.”
Digital Transformation Requires Trust
There is another obstacle to overcome, however: More than one-third of all
Germans currently say that they are mostly afraid of digitalization. Only for the
under-45s do the opportunities outweigh the fears (cf. D€orner et al. 2014). This is
where entrepreneurs, IT service providers, and politicians come in. Through our
work, we must create a sense of trust and emphasize the possibilities that digitalization
offers.
A sensitive approach to data is crucial to this. Data is the raw material of the
digital economy. We have to harness the masses of accumulated data and use them
efficiently – but for people, not against them. Data security and data protection
must therefore always be the top priority.
Foreword vii
Thanks to its strict data protection policies, Germany enjoys a great advantage
here. We should make use of it. It is good to see that Europe is finally on its way to
creating a cross-border general data protection regulation. European interior and
justice ministers recently agreed to reform Europe’s data protection rules. This will
give a considerable boost to the establishment of unified standards. This is precisely
what we have always pushed for because it is an important basis for shared and
secure digital platforms in Europe. In this way, we can create a real counterbalance
to the strong economic regions of the USA and Asia.
This book provides insights from various perspectives into how companies can
get started with their digital transformation, which factors are critical to success,
and how much potential is offered by the cloud. Specific practical examples show
how German and European companies can work with the right partners to shape the
upcoming second phase of industrial digitalization.
The future of the German and European economy is at stake here. We are in a
strong position: Germany is an industrialized nation with an outstanding reputation
as a supplier to the world. The time has come to take our expertise in mechanical
and plant engineering and our understanding of quality and combine them with the
advantages of digitalization. We have the necessary technologies. We just need to
put them to use.
The game is on – let’s get the ball rolling.

Pursuing Digital Transformation Driven
by the Cloud 1
Ferri Abolhassan
Could all of the estimated 85 million pet owners throughout Europe use an app to
track the activities of their pets? How could smart pills improve healthcare for over
26 million chronically ill people in Germany (cf. German Foundation for the
Chronically Ill 2015) by providing them with more personalized treatment? How
can a firefighter quickly find the information he needs – building plans, hydrant
locations, interactive location maps – at any time of day so that he can get straight to
the scene and save lives? How can over 100,000 employees in a global company
work together effectively across national borders and local IT barriers? The
scenarios could not be more different. But they have one important thing in
common: The solution relies on the cloud.
1.1 The Cloud Can Do Many Things
The cloud is the basis for the digitalized business models and processes that will play a
pivotal role in businesses in the future. For we will soon be living in a world in which
everything is networked to everything else. Studies (cf. Kremp 2014) have estimated
that there will be over 200 billion interconnected devices by the end of the decade.
Dealing with these vast numbers requires technology that is reliable and stable. The
cloud can do that. The Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 – virtually all of the IT sector’s
recent innovations rely on businesses being able to harness the speed and scalability of
the cloud. It is the backbone and the brainpower of the entire digitalizationmovement.
It offers more data storage and data analysis capacity. It makes it possible for an
almost limitless number of users to capture and analyze huge data volumes centrally.
There are some conditions, however, including fast, high-performance broadband
connections and powerful, secure data centers with high levels of flexibility

and scalability, and ideally compliant with stringent national data protection and
security regulations.
We can discover just how revolutionary the cloud is if we take a closer look at
the examples given earlier. Because what they show is that digitalized technologies
and processes are now everywhere – in retail, in medicine, in public security, in
large enterprises and in industry.
– Example 1 – “Tail” is a dog app package designed to give peace of mind to pet
owners. It comprises a modern tracking and sensing device contained in the
dog’s collar, and a smartphone application. It lets the dog owner know their pet’s
whereabouts at any time and tells them if there is anything they need to do to
keep their pet secure and comfortable. To ensure the availability of this kind of
app, and many similar apps being used routinely every day, there is a powerful
cloud solution working silently in the background. Should the need arise, it can
collect and evaluate the data on millions of pets from all over Europe and supply
a personalized report to each pet owner. It sounds simple, but only because the
complexity is hidden from the user and handled by the cloud.
– Example 2 – FireFighterLog is just one of many applications that have the
potential to save lives. It delivers information on the fastest route to the fire,
building floor plans, the locations of fire hydrants and the whereabouts of the
people trapped inside the building to firefighters in real time on their
wearables via the cloud, thereby giving them a 60-s time advantage over
traditional emergency response systems. Another lifesaver is the intelligent
pill, equipped with a chip that transmits electronic signals as soon as it comes
into contact with the stomach’s gastric juices. Pertinent data such as the
patient’s heart rate or sleeping times is transmitted to an app from a wearable
sensor patch, allowing the doctor to regularly monitor their patient’s state of
health and, in consultation with the patient, adjust the dose of medication in
real time.
– Example 3 – The challenge of large-scale collaboration. Storing documents
locally along with thousands of gigabytes of legacy data is common practice
in many large enterprises. But it is not a recipe for flexibility, especially when
you operate across national borders. However, thanks to the cloud, even globally
active Fortune 500 companies can achieve the agility they need for success. The
cloud enables fast, efficient communication between tens of thousands of
employees and provides instant access to growing volumes of business data
and applications.
Any list of examples showing the relevance and power of cloud technologies
would be a very long one indeed. And in each example, the cloud provides the
platform for digital growth, for new business models and for the kind of innovation
that our economy and our society need.
As the digital transformation of business advances, it is becoming increasingly
urgent for enterprises to become fully networked organizations. Entire process and
2 F. Abolhassan
supply chains between companies, partners, suppliers and customers are becoming
more tightly interlinked. This is creating completely new value networks as well as
products and services that are more flexible, more responsive and more carefully
targeted.
1.2 Knowing Today What the Customer Will Want Tomorrow
In a world where international competition for the goodwill of consumers has never
been fiercer, agility and speed are more important than ever before. Any business
planning to find, win over and keep new customers had better be ready to offer them
a unique customer experience. But it doesn’t stop there. Companies now have to be
able to predict what customers will want tomorrow and respond to their wishes even
before they have expressed them. Today’s big data technologies allow hyperpersonalized
online shopping, tailored precisely to the individual needs of the
consumer – basically a combination of real-time, technology-based data analysis
and interpretation and an individualized approach to customer service
(cf. Zukunftsinstitut 2015).
However, what applies online must also take place offline, and customer contact
has gained new significance as a result of the digitalization process. The automotive
sector is typical. There once was a time when the potential car buyer, looking for a
Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler or whatever, would pay several visits to their local
dealer to check out the cars and get advice on what to choose. Today when they go
to the car dealership, they will already have been online to browse specifications
and prices and will generally be much better informed. The car salesman has just
one opportunity to seal the deal: He has to offer the buyer significant added value as
soon as he enters the showroom. And with the aid of IT, he can do exactly that.
Omnichannel retailing and value networks offer completely new sources of information
and thus new ways for dealers and customers to interact.
Using iBeacons in the showroom vehicles and a customer app, Customer
Experience Management solutions (CEM) can even identify which model the
potential buyer is interested in. Test drives can be booked and prices retrieved
immediately and with very little effort. As soon as the vehicle has found a buyer, it
is entered into an interactive service program, which makes servicing and repairs
(and quotations) transparent for the customer as never before. The cloud provides
the ideal conditions for building close customer relations.
1.3 “Cloudification” Knows No (Industry) Limits
Digitalization has become the new and indispensable tool for companies not only
because it facilitates direct contact with the customer. Industry is experiencing a
digital transformation of the entire value chain – from design to product development,
manufacturing, transportation and logistics through to sales. Virtually all
industries are having to adapt their business models and products as a result. And
1 Pursuing Digital Transformation Driven by the Cloud 3
once again, the cloud is the key to success. Port logistics is a case in point. If
container traffic volumes are forecast to more than double by 2030, but a major
international port has already reached the limits of its capacity, the port authority
will have no option but to optimize its handling processes simply to maintain its
own competitive position. Digital technology can help speed up the flow of traffic
and goods and shorten the handling and waiting times of container ships. It can also
help port managers as well as depot, terminal and car park operators and freight
forwarders to react more quickly to the prevailing transport and infrastructure
situation.
Then there is the example of food logistics. While Rewe online and Bringmeister
have increased their share of the traditional German retail market thanks to clever
customer service initiatives like same-day delivery and multichannel models, other
business models with proven success outside Germany, such as Amazon Fresh and
eBay Local, are waiting in the wings ready to conquer the German market. This
shows that two things are happening: The traditional players are no longer the only
ones dealing directly with consumers – and logistics specialists are now coming
face-to-face with the customer. If a customer orders with a cloud-based app, they
can have their groceries delivered very quickly. If they cannot be at home to accept
the order personally, they have the option of getting them delivered to, say, the
trunk of their car. The GPS coordinates for the car are sent by phone to the
supermarket delivery person and at the same time a highly secure, cloud-based
authentication and authorization system gives them one-time access to the trunk.
Scalable, high availability cloud solutions allow businesses to respond to market
needs more effectively than ever before. The businesses who are taking advantage
of these solutions are more innovative and have the resources available to pursue
their own growth strategy. In other words, IT is the business and the cloud is the
enabler. But this also means that getting to grips with digitalization has become a
business necessity. The next seven topics offer some guidance to those wishing to
keep pace with digital developments and understand their impact upon strategy,
technology and organization.
1.3.1 Everything Stands or Falls with Digital Business Models
No business process can get by without IT today. There is very good reason why six
out of the ten most valuable companies, including Apple and Google, are IT
companies or IT-based companies (cf. Forbes 2015). The cloud supports the
formation and the business models of many new and successful companies. And
the consequences are huge. Digitalization has the potential to drive economic
growth and increase sales for companies all over the world. Experts at McKinsey
believe that by 2025 Internet technology could boost gross domestic product by
207 billion euros in Germany alone (cf. D€urand et al. 2014). This is an increase of
nearly five percent. In order to achieve this, however, the German economy will
have to succeed in setting standards for digitalization and developing some powerful
business models.
4 F. Abolhassan
“Ubering” Traditional Business Concepts
Uber, Airbnb and eBay are obvious examples of how digital change has long been a
motor of innovation. The digital business models of each of these newcomers put
the traditional market-leading enterprises under tremendous pressure. If they are to
avoid being “ubered,” as management consultant Roland Berger (cf. Berger 2015)
aptly described this development, the “majors” in all industries will have to be even
more vigilant in the future. Because the pace is relentless. According to market and
technology experts, many companies will not cope with the challenges that await
them. Gartner predicts that “digital incompetence” will cause one in four
companies worldwide to lose its competitive ranking by 2017 (cf. Gartner 2013).
Nevertheless, this also means that the majority of businesses will successfully meet
the challenge. Market participants can therefore control whether they are a winner
or a loser in the digitalization game.
Staying in the game demands agility and speed in all areas, together with
innovative products that harness the benefits of digitalization. The German car
industry is a perfect example. The technology fitted to today’s cars has turned them
into mobile data centers, a concept that has not escaped the notice of others,
including US manufacturer Tesla with its Model S. All vehicle functions are
controlled via a central tablet. The Internet, software, sensors and applications
form a central nervous system through which vehicle data travels at high speed.
But this nervous system must also be extremely powerful. At the point where
conventional technology solutions reach their limits, highly scalable and secure
cloud solutions have become indispensable in taming the “explosion” of data
volumes and providing stability, high availability, and most importantly, security
in the transmission of data. It will not take until 2050 before we have mass produced
cars that allow the driver to increase the power of his engine by 10 or 20 percent
whenever he requires an additional burst of horsepower simply by tweaking the
engine management software via the Internet. Every carmaker is expected to have
the necessary “chip tuning” solution in their options catalog within five years.
1.3.2 CIO and CEO – Best Buddies?
So who will be responsible for ensuring that digitalization is prioritized within the
company? The CIO and the CEO are really the ones who need to push for the
transformation and development of digitalized, cloud-based business models. They
will have to understand and communicate the potential of the cloud to each
department. The overall framework is in place. A new generation of IT leaders is
currently emerging, bringing with them a dedicated business background and a
business mindset. Thanks to the talents of these CIOs, CEOs are free to concentrate
on their vision for the company. Although the CEO must understand the basics of
the technology, he does not have to be too concerned about the potential pitfalls
because this can distract from the pursuit of the company’s vision. The CIO, for his
part, must support the vision but still check it for feasibility.
1 Pursuing Digital Transformation Driven by the Cloud 5
Is the Chief Digital Officer the New Creativity Manager?
Digital transformation is forcing companies to update IT systems they have used for
many years. This is often done by highly qualified specialists without the luxury of
being able to shut down the systems or relax security rules. To help them meet these
challenges as they move forward with digitalization, more and more CIOs are
finding it useful to recruit a CDO. Chief digital officers, many of whom have
followed a different career path and often come from the digital creative industries,
can strengthen the team by contributing new perspectives, ideas and solutions
(cf. K€onig 2014). The CIO has the final say, of course, because he has the ultimate
responsibility of integrating new applications and processes safely and reliably into
the company’s IT.
1.3.3 A Two-Pronged Approach
There will always be two aspects to any transformation towards the cloud: the
operational system and the new, agile IT. Despite the need for innovation, the dayto-
day work of the CIO is vital to the company’s effort to create value. With the
exception of startups, companies are only able to jump onto the moving train of
digitalization if their traditional IT operation is running securely and reliably.
Nevertheless, a dual IT infrastructure gives traditional companies the opportunity
to compensate for this limitation. Digital devices provide the necessary speed and
the additional agility. According to Gartner, around three quarters of all IT
organizations will be working with Bimodal IT (2-speed IT) by 2017 (cf. Gartner
2014) – in other words, with the traditional IT that has evolved in the enterprise over
the years and the new, agile IT designed to meet the needs of the future. Instead of
going to the considerable expense of rebuilding and updating their existing IT
infrastructures and processes immediately, many companies find it more effective
to implement innovative, parallel digital solutions (cf. Rimmler 2015), which allow
them to transform their business in stages.
Daring to Look at Things Differently – The Young IT Tearaways
If this transformation is to succeed, it needs people who think digitally. It needs a
new IT generation that is business focused and curious and has a completely
different perspective on technologies and processes. People who look for routes
well away from the established, well-trodden ones and contribute a sense of risk
tolerance and pragmatism from which the company can gain a great deal. If one
solution does not work, they are bold enough to alter their approach. They believe in
“killing it fast” and moving on. To create maximum added value for the entire
enterprise, all players are required to define the key elements of their collaboration
on a regular basis.
6 F. Abolhassan
1.3.4 You’ll Never Walk Alone – Side by Side on the Way
to the Cloud
Because projects have a tendency to increase in complexity, sometimes even during
their initial tender phase, it is important to have a partner on the supplier side who
can provide flexibility as you progress toward successful digital transformation. An
external IT service provider can offer more than just a fresh perspective on business
processes and IT structures; they can also offer a wide range of expertise, will
already have implemented numerous excellent cloud solutions and, ideally, will be
used to thinking and acting from the perspective of all stakeholders. A partner like
this will offer the customer genuine added value and will recommend and implement
the cloud model that best suits their individual needs.
With this in mind, a provider should be able to offer their customers a wide range
of interlocking cloud services from multiple vendors. In addition, providers should
have transformation experience as well as process and sector expertise in projects of
all sizes. This also applies to large corporations working in sensitive industries with
high security-critical requirements or for whom high availability is an important
criterion. An IT service provider must be familiar with the development and
operation of hybrid cloud architectures which allow business-critical processes to
move between different types of cloud services as needs change.
“Simple, Secure and Affordable” Boosts Acceptability
Dynamic delivery models such as IaaS, PaaS or SaaS, embedded in the IT and
business strategy and part of the quality and safety concept, are poised to become
pillars of enterprise IT. But to achieve this, they must be scalable and simple, secure
and affordable, and they must also meet the company’s compliance requirements.
Moreover, processes, roles and service levels must be discussed and tailored to the
cloud, in close cooperation with the departments involved.
During these discussions, if not before, the provider must provide answers to the
key issues of digitalization: Which processes and infrastructures, and which parts of
the value creation process should a company transfer to the cloud? Which path is
the right one? How will business-critical data be handled? And what will it cost?
And then, of course, the provider will have their own questions. For example, does
the company have a bottom-line or top-line strategy? Do they want to increase
income and efficiency or would they rather generate growth? (cf. Investopedia
2015). The list goes on. One thing is certain, however: There is no magic bullet.
Every customer is different but necessary problem-solving competence remains the
same. An IT provider with a breadth of expert knowledge is well placed to supply
that competence.
1.3.5 The Cloud Also Means Partnering with the Very Best
To meet the exacting demands of digitalization and stay at the cutting edge of
technology and software development, technology partnerships are essential,
1 Pursuing Digital Transformation Driven by the Cloud 7
because today’s cloud computing is all about collaboration, about managing complex
ecosystems that individual IT providers cannot reliably handle on their own.
They therefore need to work with experienced partners. It does not matter in what
country or even what continent they are based. What matters is that they collectively
develop the solution that is the most beneficial for the customer.
The ideal IT provider has invested many years in building a cloud ecosystem of
leading technology partners that allows them to identify and assemble the best
possible solutions. By selecting the right partner, with the right expertise and a
technology portfolio to match, companies not only obtain a solution that ideally fits
their needs but gain the added benefit of advice in matters relating to IT innovation,
transformation and data center solutions. The provider is the vital central cog here,
pulling together the various strands of the project, providing quality management,
catering for diverse needs and overseeing the entire value creation network. Many
companies are looking for a retail solution that is straightforward, with a simple and
intuitive frontend, but also a backend that meets the highest security standards.
Successful cloud solutions stand out by offering maximum cost effectiveness
and easy integration into existing IT environments. A good provider with their
cloud partners knows how to seamlessly integrate enterprise and IT processes. A
quality management system with partner certification will be a central component
of their partner program. Overall, what matters most is expertise along an open and
agile collaboration environment that makes it possible to offer the best solution
from the customer’s perspective. Ultimately, the focal point must always be the
customer and his requirements.
1.3.6 Maximum Performance Through Maximum Security
A business cloud contains a company’s prize assets: its customer and production
data, its strategic content and its sensitive key indicators. Organizations cannot
therefore simply place their business-critical data and applications in a normal
consumer cloud. They should also know which data center the provider is using
to send data to the cloud. They should be safe if the provider uses a secure data
center based in Germany compliant with German regulations, as the German Data
Protection Act is one of the strictest informational self-determination laws. The use
of personal data is strictly prohibited and requires explicit legal permission or the
consent of the person concerned. In the Anglo-American legal systems, the exact
opposite is true. The US intelligence services can use American terror legislation to
access personal data even without a court order. The USA FREEDOM Act, which
superseded the USA PATRIOT Act in July 2015, offers better protection for the
personal data of US citizens in the United States, but did not change the situation for
personal data held in foreign data centers. Those wishing to place their data under
the protective shield of German law with the data centers of service providers based
in Germany are still in good hands.
The issues of data security, data protection and compliance must be part of the
“big picture” of any digitalization program: Data and applications must be kept
8 F. Abolhassan
available, information protected from unauthorized disclosure to third parties and
legal considerations taken into account. This is irrespective of whether the cloud is
public or private, or a mixture – an approach that is increasingly finding favor with
business today. Country-specific laws and regulations insist that these standards
should be an integral part of any cloud strategy (cf. Experton Group 2015). This is
made possible by the use of, for example, vendor-independent cloud encryption, the
keys for which are held by the user companies.
A business-compatible cloud is also equipped with sophisticated defense
systems. The provider is responsible for carrying out ongoing preventive work on
the security architecture to protect the infrastructure and the customer’s systems.
Effective IT security is constantly learning, never static and a steadfast partner from
the very beginning.
1.3.7 Highest Quality as the Basis for IT Transformation and Digital
Growth
The greater the influence that IT has on a company’s operation and growth, the
more critical the reliability, stability and agility of the IT systems are for the
company’s success. This means, more specifically, adopting preventive measures
such as redundant technologies and taking a comprehensive, end-to-end quality
management approach. The risk of outages causing billions of dollars’ worth of
damages, reputational risks and serious data loss make the highest level of reliability
vital, and for most businesses more important as a purchase criterion than the
price of the cloud solution itself (cf. PricewaterhouseCoopers 2012).
One thing is certain: IT without incident does not exist. Businesses and IT
providers must therefore work closely together to manage and minimize the fallout
from incidents and to ensure that the highest quality is maintained. A study by the
consulting firm Sopra Steria found that one in two German companies has no
contingency plan for IT security incidents (cf. Steria 2012). This is just one area
where much needs to be done to improve quality.
A comprehensive quality assurance system must consider the interaction
between people and technology. To maximize IT security, technology partners
have to work proactively and anticipate potential problems at an early stage.
Service level agreements can help define high process standards.
Contingency management should not be ignored for those occasions when IT
fails to operate reliably.
A case can be made for having a “manager on duty” (MOD) on stand-by around
the clock, who can be contacted in the event of a crisis and who has the authority –
unlike call center agents – to put measures in place to rectify the incident immediately
and professionally. And, if necessary, to involve top management to expedite
decisions on budgets and resources. It is certainly true that, to keep everything
running smoothly, it is essential to have clearly defined contact persons, processes
and KPIs. This saves valuable time in an emergency and minimizes downtime,
frustration and costs.
1 Pursuing Digital Transformation Driven by the Cloud 9
The objective is to maintain a highly available, secure IT infrastructure at all
times and to take continuous action at technical and organizational levels to ensure
maximum stability. This is a service benefit that will ensure complete and continued
customer satisfaction. In a nutshell: Without quality there can be no cloud and
without the cloud, enterprises have a diminished capacity to innovate.
1.4 Conclusion
Digitalization and cloud-based processes are the key business drivers of the twentyfirst
century. When established as a platform for business processes, they offer
companies unique growth opportunities and the potential for achieving a distinct
competitive position and driving innovation.
For this to happen, measures need to be put in place now. Business strategies
need to be defined and forward-thinking business models developed. The roles of
CEO, CIO and CDO need to be allocated. The right IT partner, with their ecosystem
and cooperation partners, need to be selected. The essential factors for a successful
digitalization project are quality, stability and agility. IT managers themselves
should design and implement innovative solutions according to the criteria of
scalability, reliability, security, affordability and simplicity. Only when these points
are internalized will companies be ready for the future and ready to reap the
considerable benefits that digitalization has to offer.

1 Pursuing Digital Transformation Driven by the Cloud 11
The Role of IT as an Enabler of Digital
Transformation 2
Christophe Chaˆlons and Nicole Dufft
The digital transformation of the economy and society could be called a digital
revolution – one with as far-reaching an impact as the Industrial Revolution of the
nineteenth century.
This digital revolution takes a number of guises, however. It essentially began
60 years ago with the first computer. Data processing, or information technology,
then gradually spread to nearly every process and every industry with the goal of
automating processes and making them more efficient. This evolution was largely
made possible by continuous technological development.
2.1 The Digital Revolution
One essential step was taken in the 1990s with the spread of the nascent Internet and
World Wide Web. These technologies revolutionized communication both within
companies and between companies and their partners, suppliers and clients. Above
all, however, they changed how companies communicate with their end customers.
In this respect, the development of e-commerce and e-business at the end of the
1990s laid the groundwork for today’s digitalization. At the time, however, information
technology was still used mostly to support existing processes, such as
logistics, purchasing and sales, marketing and customer relationship management.
The digital transformation of today goes much further. Companies are now using
information technologies to develop fundamentally new business models, products
and services.

IT innovations not only provide support, they actually enable the radical redevelopment
of processes and value chains. This has given rise to new value networks
and to changes in the structures and power relations of entire industries. The traditional
boundaries between industries are becoming blurred.
Examples of this are plentiful. In the travel industry, for instance, travel agencies
have redefined their added value, while transportation providers such as train
companies and airlines, along with hotels and tour operators, had to adapt to the
new transparency in pricing and customer satisfaction as well as to the power of
portals such as Booking.com or Opodo.
Successful new companies are popping up everywhere, while existing companies
have to make substantial adjustments or face being squeezed out of the
market – either because they haven’t changed quickly enough (if at all), or because
they simply haven’t managed to adapt their business models to the new competition
they face from digital companies and services such as eBay, Facebook, Instagram,
Wikipedia, Booking.com, Airbnb, Uber or Spotify.
Incidentally, the music industry is a good example of just how quickly this
change can happen: Barely ten years ago, Apple revolutionized the industry with
iTunes. But today, streaming services (such as Spotify, Deezer and the new Apple
Music) are making the once-successful iTunes model irrelevant – and not just
among the youth. Apple has gone from a pioneer to an imitator.
These changes are not only affecting consumer markets (B2C); digitalization is also
exerting amassive influence on B2B markets. Business customers and consumers alike
now expect personalized interaction via various channels, both online and offline, along
with individualized, networked products and offers as well as data-based services. As a
result, product manufacturers are forced to evolve into solution providers.
And the next upheavals are already on the horizon: The new technologies
associated with the Internet of Things will radically change the business models in
other industries in the coming years – including the automobile industry, mechanical
and plant engineering, and energy.
2.2 Technological Drivers and Effects
These upheavals are being driven largely by the following technological
developments:
– Mobile technologies, which make it possible to access information, and thus to
interact or make decisions, at any time, from anywhere.
– Social media, which are massively changing the opportunities for interaction
within companies as well as with customers, partners and the general public.
– Analytics and big data, which enable companies to make well-founded decisions
(sometimes in real time) and to develop data-based business models.
14 C. Chaˆlons and N. Dufft
– Cloud computing technologies, which guarantee highly flexible access to
applications and data under reasonable financial conditions.
– And finally, the Internet of Things (IoT), which promises unlimited opportunities
for interaction and new business models by connecting products and sensors.
Of course, it is not the digital technologies themselves that are causing the
upheavals described earlier, but rather the economic effects of how these technologies
interact.
For example, the use of digital technologies dramatically increases market
transparency. Never before have customers had real-time access to so much information
about quality, functionality, prices, alternatives or customer service. Purchasing
decisions are increasingly being made on the basis of the recommendations
and experiences of other consumers. This applies to everything from books to
financial products which require extensive consultation with customers. And
never before has it been easier for customers to switch to an alternative provider
at the click of a mouse. Customers are using a growing number of digital and
non-digital channels to find information, interact with providers and eventually
make a purchase. They expect a seamless, coordinated purchasing experience
across all channels and devices (“omnichannel” is the keyword here) as well as
equally coordinated processes for billing and logistics, for instance.
Purchasing decisions are also increasingly being made on the basis of the
services that come with a product. In many cases, services have become a more
important market differentiator than the product itself. This applies to networked
sporting goods which use apps to analyze athletic performance, networked household
goods which can be controlled via apps, and machines whose maintenance
status can be analyzed remotely. Connecting applications with devices via IoT
technologies, or with other users via social media, is becoming increasingly important
to the added value of an offer. At the same time, products do not necessarily
have to be owned anymore; instead, they can be used as a service. Sharing models
now exist not only for cars and bicycles but even for complex machines.
Above all, however, customers now expect personalized experiences and offers
which are tailored to their individual preferences. But because individual preferences
can continually shift, companies must be able to react to customer expectations
or changing demand in real time – or, ideally, in advance. At the same time,
price pressure has tended to increase rather than decrease in nearly every industry.
Individualized products at a low cost are only possible with a high degree of
automation. In light of this, mass customization is a key challenge when it comes
to differentiation in the digital age.
2.3 The Three Stages of Digital Transformation
Digitalization is fundamentally changing our economy. There are three different
stages to this:
2 The Role of IT as an Enabler of Digital Transformation 15
1. The digital workplace: The spread of smartphones and other mobile devices such
as tablets; collaborative tools such as video conferencing and chat; using social
networks in a corporate environment; “consumerization” or the growing penetration
of technologies (hardware and software) originally designed for private
users which are miles ahead of the old IT landscape in terms of their ease of use.
Together, these developments have radically changed the user experience of the
IT user.
2. The digital customer experience: The second stage no longer affects IT users in a
company, but rather the customer. In a networked, digital world, where
customers share their experiences with everyone and can switch to a competitor
in the space of seconds, the optimal customer experience has become the key to
remaining competitive. This is because a negative customer experience will
directly and immediately affect a company’s brand perception and sales.
Companies must therefore shift their strategic focus to the comprehensive,
individualized optimization of the customer experience across all digital and
traditional contact points. Design plays an important role here in terms of both
graphic presentation and the design of the user experience. Simplicity, intuitiveness
and reactivity are key characteristics. Up until now, most companies have
focused mainly on the digital transformation of their front end to the customer
and neglected the integration with the back office. But an optimal customer
experience demands the company-wide digitalization and integration of all
processes as well as a comprehensive focus on the customer. This is because
back-end processes – in logistics, accounting, warehousing or product development,
for example – can have at least as much impact on the customer experience
as customer-facing areas. Therefore, in addition to transforming marketing
and sales, digital transformation must involve the customer-focused digitalization
and integration of all front-end and back-end processes in a company.
3. Digital business models and ecosystems: The third stage encompasses new sales
models as well as new products and new business models which often lead to
new digital ecosystems. In the medium to long term, companies will not be able
to withstand the growing competitive pressure on their own. This is why
traditional value chains are increasingly being replaced by digital ecosystems
and service networks. A variety of stakeholders from different sectors will work
together in these networks to develop collaborative business models. They will
share data and information (and even predictions and correlation analyses) so
that they can jointly offer a better service or assert themselves against a competitor.
Such digital ecosystems are already beginning to emerge, particularly in the
Internet of Things – or, to be more precise, the Internet of Things and Services,
because the services surrounding networked products are what offer added value
for the customer. There are already numerous examples of this in areas such as
the connected car for the automobile industry, predictive maintenance in
mechanical and plant engineering, smart meters and the smart grid in the energy
industry, and smart health via remote access to, or even the remote control of,
medical devices in the health sector.
16 C. Chaˆlons and N. Dufft
2.4 What Digital Transformation Requires from Information
Technology
Digitalization opens up limitless possibilities, but it also calls for a profoundly
different way of thinking and an extensive transformation of organizations, processes
and corporate culture. This is because companies are facing considerable
new requirements in the digital age – particularly when it comes to information
technology.
2.4.1 Agility
The most important requirement – or challenge, more likely – is agility and adaptability.
The pace of change has picked up dramatically in the digital world. As a
result, agility has become an essential factor for success. Companies must not only
identify and respond to the opportunities and risks of digitalization, they must also
adapt quickly to changing market and competitive conditions. They must be able to
implement, test, refine – and then potentially abandon – new ideas very rapidly.
Agile IT is absolutely essential to this. The new approach is “build – measure – learn
– improve”, or even “try – fail – learn – improve.” Contrary to the approach taken by
traditional IT organizations, the goal here is not to develop the optimal system for the
next ten years, but rather to implement an idea as fast as possible and optimize it in a
continual learning process. Speed, reactivity and flexibility are the keywords here.
And when an idea takes off, it has to be scaled up very quickly.
Even though technology can’t solve every problem, cloud computing is ideal for
ensuring the agility, scalability and flexibility required here.
First of all, software-as-a-service (SaaS) makes it possible to implement and
launch applications very swiftly and easily. SaaS also eliminates many maintenance
and operational concerns. And SaaS developments are generally based on open
standards, which usually makes them easy to integrate – either with the back office
or with other applications and data sources. Alongside traditional, comprehensive
applications, the SaaS model is increasingly offering a number of “micro apps”
which can be put together like a puzzle and expanded if necessary.
If a required application is not available as a standard in the SaaS model, the
PaaS approach (platform-as-a-service) makes it possible to develop it efficiently,
test it in the target environment and then – most importantly – implement and
launch it quickly and smoothly. Finally, infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) ensures
the scalability needed to carry out individual tasks such as processing and analyzing
larger amounts of data.
The strengths of any cloud model include agility, scalability, flexibility, simplicity
and speed – from implementation to integration, maintenance and operations. At
the same time, cloud solutions must meet the requirements of security, reliability
and data protection. Hybrid approaches which combine the public cloud, a hosted
private cloud or even an in-house private cloud facilitate the creation of
2 The Role of IT as an Enabler of Digital Transformation 17
differentiated environments for different applications, users and data profiles and
their corresponding requirements.
2.4.2 Ability to Innovate
The ability to innovate is another essential challenge in the age of digitalization.
While many companies in the past focused on creating and marketing existing
products and services more efficiently using (IT-based) process optimization, we
now need a radical change in thinking: Innovations are in the spotlight, and
established companies have to act like startups. A fundamental cultural shift and
new forms of collaboration and leadership are required in order to mobilize all of
the innovative power in a company. Organizations must revise their conventional
ways of thinking and working, their traditional management approaches and their
control mechanisms.
Above all, the need for rapid innovation places new demands on IT because IT is
often at the heart of innovations, thus playing an important role as an enabler.
The ability to innovative therefore requires the corresponding IT architectures,
IT working environments and development approaches.
As a result, iterative approaches based on the lean startup concept are becoming
an increasingly important alternative to conventional waterfall models. The main
goal of methods such as Scrum or DevOps is to significantly boost speed and agility
when it comes to the development (as well as the implementation, operation,
maintenance and further development) of new products and services. At the same
time, these methods demand and promote a new kind of culture which focuses on
customer-centered activities, continuous change and sharing. Interactivity is the
keyword – both within a company and with customers. Developers must be able to
react promptly to customer feedback and the evaluation of user data, and partners
and customers are frequently being included in the innovation and development
process.
It is tremendously difficult to apply such methods to companies that have always
been organized along conventional, industrial lines, and the only way to do so is
step by step. What’s needed first are incubators which test these approaches in
multidisciplinary teams, develop them further and then actively support their
dissemination to other areas. An IT department is the ideal organization to initiate
such multidisciplinary teams and coordinate their work because IT-driven
innovations are increasingly at the core of new services, products and business
models in the digital age.
2.4.3 Simplicity
Another key aim of these new development approaches is to produce simple,
intuitive applications and products. Simplicity and user-friendliness are demanded
at every stage of digitalization, starting with the digital workplace (user experience)
18 C. Chaˆlons and N. Dufft
and going all the way to the digital transformation of the customer front-end
(customer experience). No one these days wants to have to read a manual in
order to be able to use a product or a website.
The demand for simplicity is not restricted to the front office, however; the
back office should and must be simplified as well. Most IT departments today are
struggling to maintain and operate their legacy systems, so they have limited
resources available for innovation. They suffer under the complexity of their IT
landscape which has evolved over the years through adaptations, expansions and
integration measures. Furthermore, most systems were developed to support
existing organizational units. The new IT must be lean IT, meaning that it should
encompass simple, efficient, appropriate processes and forms of organization.
2.4.4 Intelligent Use of Data
Digital interaction channels are opening up entirely new ways of collecting customer
information and using it to expand and optimize the customer experience.
For example, the price of a product can be adapted to the competitive environment,
or the right product for a campaign can be selected on the basis of the (expected)
weather conditions. A logistics service provider in Germany has developed a
new business model for fast-food restaurants: The provider analyzes the correlation
between weather conditions, events (such as soccer games) and delivery volumes
and now sells demand forecasts to its clients.
The opportunities are even greater when products themselves can provide
individualized usage information via the emerging Internet of Things.
It is critical to make intelligent use of this growing volume of data, which is the
basis not only for the individualized optimization of the customer experience, but
above all for the optimization of processes, for making operational and strategic
decisions and for business innovations. Companies must be able to centrally collect
and store this mass of data from different sources, analyze it in real time and make it
available for a variety of uses.
2.5 How IT Can Become an Enabler of Digital Transformation
Nearly every German company has acknowledged that digitalization is an important
issue, but most companies are only carrying out isolated digital projects
without pursuing a uniform, company-wide strategy. As a result, digitalization
often resembles a patchwork of ambitious but uncoordinated initiatives. But
companies need a digital strategy and a digital agenda in order to establish guide
rails so that they don’t get lost in the jungle of possibilities.
IT has to play a key role here from both a technical and an organizational perspective,
because digitally successful companies are unthinkable without centrally
positioned IT. Ultimately, a central authority is needed which can
2 The Role of IT as an Enabler of Digital Transformation 19
– Coordinate digital initiatives on the basis of a comprehensive digital strategy and
ensure that the applications developed in this context mesh with one another;
– Bundle together data streams throughout the company, orchestrate them and
prepare them for further analysis;
– Maintain and monitor the observance of security, compliance and data protection
regulations; and
– Coordinate and shape collaboration with technology suppliers, including hardware,
software and cloud providers aswell as traditional IT service providers and resellers.
But in order to fulfill its strategic role in the digital transformation and position
itself as a pioneer and service provider for other departments, the IT organization
itself has to change fundamentally. Much like a startup, it must view itself as an
agile, interactive, learning system in which planning and control are replaced by a
step-by-step approach to solving problems. At the same time, IT officers must
create an environment in which this “IT 2.0” can flourish.
This calls for the creation of latitude. IT organizations that are “trapped” in
operational tasks and primarily occupied with maintaining and operating an
existing IT landscape and managing IT costs lack the breathing space needed to
drive the necessary change. Consolidating, standardizing and modernizing the
legacy IT landscape and using technologies and business models such as cloud
computing, outsourcing and offshoring can create latitude. This will be financial
latitude, in that the money saved on legacy operations can be applied to new
projects, and it will also be personnel latitude, in that well-trained employees will
be freed up from routine tasks and can work on innovative sandbox projects instead.
Large, established corporations often have a two-part system these days: a
system for historical products which is optimized for stability and efficiency
(system of record), and a system for new digital offerings which is optimized for
innovation and speed (systems of engagement). Here, too, there is an urgent need
for (at least partial) integration to prevent the creation of new silo solutions.
If they want to meet the demand for agility and innovation, IT organizations
should also review their performance management and KPIs. Experience has shown
that there is little use in appealing to the innovativeness, agility and cooperativeness
of employees if they are managed using conventional efficiency criteria. Leadership
in agile organizations is not based on strict hierarchies and micro-management, it is
built on trust and latitude for the employees on the one hand, and on managers
actively communicating and exemplifying the organization’s goals and visions on
the other. Even in an IT department, the employees need coaches, not control freaks.
Agile approaches should also include suppliers and partners. This is all the more
important when it comes to establishing digital ecosystems – that is, digital value
creation networks which, according to Pierre Audoin Consultants, will become very
important in the medium term. Appropriately designed contracts and incentive
systems are required here. Agile developments and high standards of flexibility
are not fully compatible with rigid work contracts or outsourcing agreements.
20 C. Chaˆlons and N. Dufft
Companies should check to see whether risk- and profit-sharing mechanisms can be
built into their contract systems. It is also advisable for provider management to be
oriented more towards the end result and the view of the end customer.
Last but not least, the IT organization must do more to embrace one particular
issue: customer orientation, or a focus on the needs of the end customer. The IT
organization has to position itself as the central coordinator, technical consultant
and integrator of projects at the interface to the customer, and even as a trailblazer
for an optimal customer experience. However, this requires that the IT organization
seek out – and even moderate – dialogue with every other department (including
marketing, sales and customer service). An IT organization is in the best position to
develop and implement a multi-channel strategy and thus guarantee an optimal
customer experience across all contact points.
2.6 Conclusion
Digital transformation is profoundly changing our economy and society. Every
company needs a dedicated strategy and a digital agenda if it wants to move
forward efficiently. Technologies such as cloud computing, analytics and agile
methods can help implement this strategy. Speed, agility, flexibility and reactivity
are absolutely essential. Above all, however, the ability to innovative is the critical
factor for success in the digital age. This calls for latitude, new forms of cooperation
and the integration of partners and customers. Information technologies are the
heart of digitalization. Agile and innovative IT is essential to the agility and
innovative capability of the entire company.
In light of this, the IT organization has to play a central role in digital transformation
– and it has to change fundamentally as well!

The Digital Transformation of
Industry – The Benefit for Germany 3
Dieter Schweer and Jan Christian Sahl
Mobile Internet, social media and digital services have become part of our daily
lives. The era of the Internet of Things – the network of products and machines – is
just beginning. Entire value chains are being transformed by digital technology,
some of it evolutionary, some of it disruptive. Anything that can be digitized will be
digitized. Are Germany and Europe at the forefront of this movement? A study by
Roland Berger Strategy Consultants on behalf of the BDI concluded that the digital
transformation could add around 1.25 trillion euros to Europe’s industrial value
creation by 2025 – but could also diminish it by 605 billion euros.
German industry boasts a wealth of innovative companies. Its outstanding competitive
strength in manufacturing, logistics and science and its balance of large
enterprises and medium-sized businesses makes it ideally qualified to spearhead the
digital transformation movement. Many of Germany’s manufacturing companies are
highly automated. There are approximately 282 robots for every 10,000 industrial
jobs in Germany – compared with 14 in China. Germany has numerous “hidden
champions,” world leaders in specialist and highly complex industrial product
service systems. Moreover, Germany, along with the US and Japan, is one of the
biggest manufacturers of embedded systems, those postage stamp-sized computers
that manage complex control and data processing tasks in a wide range of products
and equipment. Although virtually unseen by users, these systems play an important
part in our daily lives. They are to be found in medical devices, washing machines,
cars and production machinery. They reduce costs by around 25 percent and are
responsible for about 80 percent of the product innovations in today’s cars. Their
share of industrial value creation will continue to rise. If the truth be known,
however, comparisons with other countries, including with other EU member states,
reveal that Germany has a number of weaknesses, some of which give cause for
serious concern. Other regions of the world dominate so many fields of the digital

economy that technological dependency has become a real risk. For example,
European companies account for only about 10 percent of the global sales revenues
in information and communication technology (ICT). While the ICT market is
growing at 11 percent in China and 4 percent in the US, in the EU growth is a
mere 1.3 percent. The manufacturers of the best-selling IT hardware, PCs and
laptops are based in the USA and Asia. The situation is no different with
smartphones and consumer electronics. The biggest IT service providers and almost
all of the top-selling software companies are headquartered in the USA. Only a few
European companies have earned themselves a place near the top of the global
rankings. And despite dominating the sector 15 years ago, today there isn’t a single
European company in the world’s top ten cell phone manufacturers.
What has been the problem? What needs to change to make the digital single
market a reality in Europe? What is working well at the moment? Do we have the
right innovation culture and is the legal and regulatory framework up to the job?
3.1 Building Digital Freeways
A powerful, secure and widely available digital infrastructure is the foundation of
any digital economy and society. Manufacturing, networked medical services,
intelligent mobility—the success of many of tomorrow’s solutions depends on
fast, reliable networks. Germany should be leading the way here. Instead, in an
international comparison of average connection speeds Germany is in 28th place
(cf. ◉ Fig. 3.1).
This is not solely a problem for the digital economy. Broadband networks vary
depending on where you live—just like power and transport networks. And like any
other infrastructure investment, investment in broadband infrastructure increases
the capital stock of the economy, which in turn increases the per capita income and

productivity within the economy. Important social challenges like the switch to
renewables or intelligent traffic management cannot be mastered without a powerful
digital infrastructure.
The German government’s aim of achieving nationwide coverage at connection
speeds of at least 50 Mbps by 2018 is a step in the right direction. In the long term,
however, this can only be an intermediate step. Industry’s machine-to-machine
communications, the applications of the networked healthcare industry and the
entertainment industry’s products (video on demand, UHDTV, video telephony,
computer games) require more powerful broadband connectivity. Studies have
shown that, by 2025, high-volume broadband users will need an average speed of
350 Mbps. Even occasional users are forecast to need 60 Mbps. The sums required
to deliver this level of service are enormous. Achieving the German government’s
broadband target will take an investment of between 20 and 35 billion euros. The
cost of rolling out a nationwide fiber optic network is estimated at somewhere
between 80 and 95 billion euros.
But the telecommunications companies will only invest in the expansion of their
networks when there is a financial incentive to do so. The regulatory framework plays
a vital role here. The liberalization of the telecommunications market put tremendous
pressure on prices – for the benefit of many customers. Today, a national phone call
costs less than three percent and some international calls less than one percent of what
they used to cost. If we are to have a regulatory framework that is supportive of
innovation and investment, the regulatory triangle ofGermany’s Telecommunications
Act needs to be rebalanced. The government’s three regulatory objectives include
safeguarding competition, providing universal services and supporting an efficient
telecommunications infrastructure. This will take more than low prices for German
end consumers. Itwill take a powerful telecommunications industry with the ability to
fund the expansion of broadband. Synergies also need to be exploited more effectively,
through better coordination of construction and fiber optic cable laying projects
and the shared use of other infrastructures.
Also important are carefully balanced rules on network neutrality to allow
providers to differentiate their services. It must be possible for telecommunications
companies to offer special services that guarantee a minimum connection speed,
response time or reliability. This will provide additional resources to fund the
development of the kind of digital infrastructures that are critical for the success
of Industry 4.0 solutions in particular. It is clear that the digital applications of the
industry of the future will not function without a guaranteed minimum connection
performance.
3.2 The Web Requires Trust and Security
Unless there is confidence that data will be handled reliably and securely, many
digital innovations and data-centric business models will simply not gain acceptance.
Trust in digital applications requires confidence in the security and integrity
of data.
3 The Digital Transformation of Industry – The Benefit for Germany 25
Unfortunately, the revelations about widespread spying by the intelligence
services have dealt a serious blow to public trust in the integrity of data (cf. ◉
Fig. 3.2). Concerns about unrestricted access to information can have a significant
impact on how digital networking is accepted. The EU must work with other
countries to find the answers. Personal data – as well as valuable trade secrets –
must be better protected. Strong data protection and reliable data security are a
competitive advantage for Europe’s patchwork of different data protection regimes
is economically harmful because it fragments markets, prevents economies of scale,
blocks innovation, discourages many smaller companies and confuses many
customers. After nearly four years of talks, the EU General Data Protection
Regulation really should have been agreed by now.
Companies rely on being able to transfer data globally. Indeed, without global
data transfer, networked personnel and legal departments or global R&D projects
could not even function. Data-based innovations in particular need a modern data
protection regime. Only by intelligently linking data (including personal data) can
we deliver new, often customized, solutions to the customer – from mobility
products and services, to energy utilities and healthcare services. Germany cannot
dissociate itself from this trend.
A carefully balanced legal framework for data processing in Europe could
simultaneously satisfy both objectives: greater trust from knowing that personal
data is well protected and more innovation as a result of sensible regulations for
new business models. The EU’s strategy for data protection should be based on
more transparency and greater customer sovereignty. In addition, the lex loci
solution should apply: All suppliers to the European market, even those from
outside Europe, must comply with European law regardless of the location of the
corporate headquarters or the place where data has been processed. This is the only
way to ensure that all EU countries will enjoy reliable standards in the future. This
is an important locational advantage.
Fig. 3.2 How Can We Leverage the Data Treasure Trove? Trust Is the Key
26 D. Schweer and J.C. Sahl
Equally important for confidence in the digital world is the security of data and
IT systems. The growing number of system interfaces crossing corporate
boundaries and the widespread use of wireless communications are making attacks
on corporate IT systems easier to carry out. Today, the damage done to German
industry by cybercrime is thought to be around 50 billion euros annually. Approximately
one in three companies have been victims of cyber attacks. Germany loses a
higher percentage of its gross domestic product from cybercrime than any country
in the world (cf. ◉ Fig. 3.3).
To ward off cyber attacks by organized crime and external intelligence services,
government and business must work together to strengthen IT security. It is very
much in the interests of German industry to protect the IT systems and networks that
support their back office and production operations. Corporate security continues to
improve and is subject to regular audits. However, because the issue ultimately affects
all of society, close integration between industry, public authorities and academia is
essential. This is why German industry has been backing the IT Security Act. Some
business sectors have been subject to extensive statutory reporting and disclosure
requirements at national level for some time. The German government’s implementation
plan (KRITIS) to protect critical infrastructures calls for efficient reporting
processes both to government authorities and between companies – bilaterally
as well as within the German CERT Association.
3.3 Strong Digital Domestic Market
Europe urgently needs a digital single market – a large European market in which
the same rules apply, from Portugal to Finland and from Ireland to Romania.
Because the Internet does not stop at national borders. Digital business models
Fig. 3.3 Economic Losses from Cybercrime (as a Percentage of GDP) – Germany Worst Affected
3 The Digital Transformation of Industry – The Benefit for Germany 27
are particularly reliant on – and benefit greatly from – proximity to a large, single
market. The number of customers is often a critical success factor. No successful
Internet company based in Germany or the EU can ever hope to establish itself
without the ability to exploit “critical mass” and network effects. What is more,
digital business models can be expanded very easily across national boundaries –
virtually at the touch of a button. There is no need to set up costly local offices or
sales structures. The European Commission’s Digital Single Market strategy
launched in May 2015 is a first step in the right direction. Nevertheless, companies
currently have to adapt their new business models to suit 28 different markets. A
digital single market would create a domestic market for our companies that would
be even bigger than the US market.
3.4 Work 4.0: The Skilled Workforce
Are Industry 4.0 factories all manned solely by robots and machines that communicate
with each another and work autonomously? Unions and companies both
agree that this is not what Industry 4.0 is all about. Yet there can be no doubt that
digitalization is changing the world of work. For a start, the digital transformation
offers workers greater freedoms, such as working hours and working models that
adapt to suit the individual. Work times and locations as well as task fulfillment are
becoming increasingly flexible. Secondly, the digital transformation is placing
greater demands on employee skills and qualifications. There is a strong demand
for well educated professionals who continually adapt their skills and qualifications
to meet new and emerging technological needs. The education system must also
adapt more quickly to new technologies. In order to understand the complexity in
the digital industry, subject specialists and managers must be capable of thinking
and acting across systems. The engineers in a smart factory need to understand not
just the production processes and manufacturing technologies; they also need to
have an appreciation of the underlying IT infrastructure as well as the increased
security risks. Completely new, highly demanding job profiles are emerging.
Because of the massive amounts of information and data being generated, we
need specialists who can filter the relevant business data from the vast amount of
data available. Data scientists like these are still relatively scarce. This will have to
change if we are to make the most of the digital transformation’s potential for
growth. The fall “MINT” Report from the Cologne Institute for Economic Research
revealed that German industry has a shortage of about 120,000 specialists with
professional or academic degrees in the MINT specialisms of mathematics, IT,
natural sciences and technology. As well as establishing long-term education and
training programs, Germany needs to encourage qualified professionals to move to
Germany from other countries. Any red tape standing in the way of the
practical implementation of immigration law should be removed as a matter of
urgency. In the future, communicating more effectively with professionals from
outside Germany and managing immigration in a more targeted way will make a
big difference.
28 D. Schweer and J.C. Sahl
3.5 Cloud Computing Guidelines
Nowadays, it is not unusual for German businesses to outsource their data
processing to efficient and reliable specialist providers. In addition to managing
the usual business processes, cloud services are frequently responsible for the data
management of the new, data-intensive business models being used by German
industry, since many of the big data analysis tools require much greater computing
capacities than the average company’s own IT system can provide. Cloud services
are thus playing an active part in stimulating new growth in the information society
(cf. ◉ Fig. 3.4).
Cloud computing also influences the added value created by industry and thus
the long-term competitiveness of the German economy. The EU Commission
estimates that the cloud could create as much as 250 billion euros of added value
along with 2.5 million new jobs in the EU by 2020. However, before it can gain
acceptance, there must be trust in the integrity and security of the cloud. Unfortunately,
recent revelations about the activities of foreign security agencies have left
their mark. We know from Bitkom’s “Cloud Monitor 2015” that security, trust and
transparency are key success factors for cloud providers. It also appears that data
center operators in Germany have a clear locational advantage: More than 83
percent of the customers surveyed said that they expect their cloud provider to
operate its data centers exclusively within Germany. The government needs to put
in place guidelines that will create confidence and strengthen Germany’s position as
a favored location for data centers, which are after all the data factories of the digital
economy and the physical basis of the Internet for the factories of the
manufacturing sector. With DE-CIX, the world’s largest Internet exchange, political
stability, robust data protection (restricting access by police and security
agencies) and a reliable power supply system, Germany has the ideal conditions
for attracting international cloud providers. However, due to the high price of
Fig. 3.4 Why Is Cloud Computing of Such Value to Enterprises?
3 The Digital Transformation of Industry – The Benefit for Germany 29
electricity in Germany, the market for data centers is actually growing much faster
in other European countries. In Amsterdam, where operators pay just two thirds of
the German electricity prices, data center space has increased by 75 percent since
2008. In Paris, where electricity prices are approximately half those in Germany, it
was 57 percent. In Frankfurt, by contrast, the market has grown by just 20 percent
since 2008.
Unlike some other energy-intensive industries, data centers in Germany are not
exempt from the Renewable Energy Act surcharge. Yet power accounts for about
40 percent of the total cost of running a data center. Offsetting these disadvantages
by improving energy efficiency is not really possible. According to a study by
Bitkom, 45 percent of German data center operators would not rule out relocating
their operations abroad. This should set the alarm bells ringing and tell the
politicians that they need to do something about it.
3.6 Centralized Digital Platforms
The digital transformation of traditional industries faces a number of challenges. To
successfully network industrial value chains, norms and standards need to be
defined and innovative technologies, business models and new training concepts
need to be implemented. In Germany, this can be done with the “Plattform Industrie
4.0” or with the “Industrial Data Space”, the promising Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft
initiative in which businesses work alongside politicians, associations and trade
unions to try to solve important technical, legal and social problems. Similar
initiatives to promote and coordinate digitalized industry have now been set in
many other countries in Europe – and around the world. In the United States, for
example, there is the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC). Founded at the beginning
of 2014, the organization now has more than 150 members, including a sizable
contingent of German companies such as Bosch and Siemens.
3.7 Startups Are Driving the Market
Startups are the drivers of a country’s innovative power. Today, we often see young
companies working together with established global players. This can be a win-win
situation for both sides. Startups have been quick to establish themselves in the
marketplace with new business models such as, for example, Internet-based
services for Industry 4.0 technologies. In Germany, the digital economy has a
vigorous startup scene, with particularly successful clusters in Berlin, Munich,
Hamburg and Cologne. In international comparisons, however, the German startup
scene lags well behind – especially in terms of funding opportunities. Relative to
the size of the economy, seven times as much venture capital is available in the
United States as in Germany. We urgently need to stimulate the flow of additional
private capital, particularly venture capital. Despite the growing importance of the
private equity sector, the German equity market has a great deal of catching up to do
to match its European competitors – not to mention the United States. This will only
30 D. Schweer and J.C. Sahl
happen if there is a change in the statutory framework, and particularly in the tax
laws. The 2008 Private Equity Act was no more than a first step in improving the
funding opportunities available to young, innovative, unlisted businesses.

3 The Digital Transformation of Industry – The Benefit for Germany 31
Theses on Digitalization 4
August-Wilhelm Scheer
Companies are alarmed by the buzzword “digitalization” and don’t know specifically
what to do. They are hearing about the threat of new business models, reading about
the enormous sums paid for startups which haven’t yet made a single dollar of profit
and watching their competitors join in the chorus of scaremongers who say their
sector is making the big change to Industry 4.0 or is about to be replaced by
e-business. And here’s the problem: All of this could, or will be, true – the massive
attack on the status quo has already started! The following eleven theses on digitalization
explicitly describe how a company should actually respond to the new competitive
environment in order to succeed in the market.
4.1 In Praise of Slowness
Former hedge fund manager and author Nassim Nicholas Taleb uses the term
“antifragility” to describe how a system can leverage an external attack in order
to hit upon new ideas and take advantage of the situation. This is known as making a
virtue of necessity!
But how should you actually get started if you want to come out of a situation
stronger than before instead of just timidly running with the pack?
You certainly don’t do it merely by copying what everyone else is doing. As a
well-known philosopher once told me: “If you just hastily follow the waves of
innovation, you’ll come in second at best. If you want to come in first, you need the
courage to go slow. Then you have to sit down with a blank piece of paper, analyze
the situation, identify what’s driving new technologies and use this insight to
develop your own approach.”

33
It can be useful to think about organizational contrasts here: Does digitalization
support a more decentralized organizational structure or a more centralized one?
Does it lead to more standardized or more customized products? Do customers want
to take ownership of a product, or is it enough to have access rights to it?
It is also helpful (and sometimes distressingly telling) to try to answer the
question of what kind of customer benefit model currently applies to one’s own
products or services. Often the answer is neither spontaneous nor convincing. And
now this question has to be answered for digitalized products and services, too.
True innovations rarely emerge from teams because social pressure drives
people to compromise and fall in line with vocal opinion leaders. So the new
business model – consisting primarily of the benefit model for the customer as
well as the revenue model and the resource model – must be hammered out alone, in
private, at most with the aid of heated discussions and brainstorming sessions. This
is the only way to create something truly new.
4.2 Carefully Sound Out the Content of Catchwords
If concepts like Industry 4.0 (I4.0) are too narrowly defined, they run the risk of
being discredited because they can’t prove their worth. For example, I4.0 is often
applied solely to plant automation through cyber physical systems (CPS). But it
should actually be used to make manufacturing more flexible, among other things.
The goal is to be able to produce a lot size of one at mass-production costs.
However, this flexibilization only makes sense if product development is made
more flexible as well so customized versions of products can be created more
quickly. This link between CPS and product development is reflected in the I4.0
concept promoted by industry associations such as the German Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers’ Association (ZVEI), the German Association for Information
Technology, Telecommunications and New Media (Bitkom) and the German
Mechanical Engineering Association (VDMA). But even this does not go far
enough. More product versions lead to more fragmented procurement processes,
more suppliers and thus to more complex logistics, all of which has to be taken into
account. Only by looking at the entire value chain is it possible to draw up a
comprehensive model for I4.0 and a meaningful business plan for a company.
We are unaccustomed to thinking in terms of comprehensive business and value
chains because this type of thinking takes us beyond the traditional boundaries
between disciplines and divisions. But because digitalization makes value chains
more complex, it is essential to take such a comprehensive approach. For example,
the beneficiaries of a service are often not the same as those paying for the service –
such as when a social network can be used for free, while revenues are generated
through advertising.
34 A.-W. Scheer
4.3 Disruptive or Gradual Digitalization
When it comes to digitalization, companies can either determine which parts of an
existing product or business process can be digitalized, or they can fundamentally
question their existing product or business process and develop a new approach
which is only possible through digitalization. The first approach leads to more
gradual digitalization, while the second leads to disruptive digitalization. Both
approaches have advantages which become apparent when we look at the digitalization
of the taxi industry, for instance.
The mytaxi and BetterTaxi applications have digitalized (and expanded) the
services offered by conventional taxi dispatchers, but they have not challenged the
professional taxi business. We could refer to this as gradual digitalization. Uber, on
the other hand, wants to bring down the taxi business by offering private ridesharing
opportunities through its UberPop service. Uber’s business is based on the
zero marginal cost principle as described by the futurist Jeremy Rifkin (cf. Rifkin
2014). This is a disruptive approach.
In a similar vein, the American company Airbnb is disrupting the traditional
hotel business by providing access to private rooms, while the Internet service
TRIVAGO has merely digitalized the process of finding hotel rooms.
Google is said to always take a disruptive approach. It refers to this as its “10”
vision – meaning that it wants every new project to be at least ten times better than
an existing solution. When it comes to car development, Google is focusing on
completely driverless operation, and it wants to flip around the current car usage
ratio, where cars sit idle 95 percent of the time and are only driven 5 percent of the
time. Both Uber and Google are repositioning the car. Ownership is no longer
important; what matters is access to mobility as a service. Digitalization has
therefore led to an entirely new – i.e., disruptive – business model.
4.4 Organizational Drivers Behind Cloud Computing
There is no such thing as an optimal organization. Sometimes a centralized organization
will have advantages that outweigh its disadvantages, while in another
situation the benefits of a decentralized organization will win out. Centralization
has advantages in that similar activities are handled in a similar way, economies of
scale can be leveraged and supervision is easier. The benefits of decentralization, by
contrast, include the use of individual skills and requirements as well as more
highly motivated users. Organizational tensions also exist between a strong focus
on optimal processes and the utilization of resources.
When electronic data processing was first introduced, centralized systems
known as mainframes were used. In the 1960s they could easily cost several million
dollars. IT managers therefore aimed to make heavy use of their expensive
computers. Capacity utilization rates of over 95 percent were not unusual. However,
the high capacity utilization of the computer as a resource came at the expense
of user processes. The time-sharing operating systems in place at the time led to
4 Theses on Digitalization 35
long response times, and central IT departments had to manage long waiting lists of
user requests for applications. User processes were therefore badly supported.
Organizational principles changed when the PC wave hit; users now had
decentralized access to their own computers, they no longer had to deal with
waiting times and could develop their own “applications” with office software.
User processes improved considerably. But the decentralized PCs and servers of
today have a low capacity utilization of sometimes just 10 percent. Process optimization
now dominates resource optimization.
This low resource utilization offers potential for stronger centralization – and
this is one of the drivers of cloud computing. Since the cloud can be used 24 h a day
worldwide, its servers have a high capacity utilization with corresponding
economies-of-scale effects. Centralization simplifies maintenance, system protection
and updates, as well as training and supervision.
The goal now is to ensure that these centralization and resource advantages do
not come at the expense of user processes. Cloud services must be as easy to access
and system availability must be at least as high as it would be with a PC.
However, there are very good reasons to believe that it will be possible for cloud
computing to combine the advantages of centralization and decentralization, as well
as of resource and process optimization.
4.5 The Courage to Market Yourself
The most prominent examples of spectacular digitalization success have come from
the USA (see Uber and Google). But digitalization is a global phenomenon, and
every single country and company can make use of its potential and strengths to
achieve extraordinary success. However, it is important for this success to be
publicized internationally through PR and marketing campaigns. Germany and
German industry must not acquire a reputation for having introduced the first
waves of industrialization and then let digitalization pass them by. The results of
research projects and excellence clusters (such as OWL¼OstWestfalenLippe,
Emergent Software Cluster Southwest Germany) can serve as impressive examples
of digitalization from Germany, and model factories such as those operated by
Wittenstein in Fellbach or by Bosch should be highlighted as trendsetting digitalization
projects.
The startup scenes in Berlin and Munich are also producing some impressive
results. The news that big American companies like Microsoft and Apple have
bought German tech startups like six Wunderkinder GmbH and Metaio GmbH at
high multiples of earnings proves that these startups are highly innovative – but the
risk is that their technologies will now be refined overseas. These startups might
have been able to achieve an international breakthrough on their own. For this to be
possible, however, the startup scene urgently needs the support of a growth and
internationalization program. The financing scene also has to be structured so that
the focus is not on the exit – when investors sell the company for the best price – but
rather on the sustainable business growth of the startup.
36 A.-W. Scheer
The achievements of XING, a social network for professionals, and Research
gate, an Internet platform for researchers, also show that digitalization success
stories are possible in the B2C sector in Germany.
In general, German companies must be more proactive in demonstrating that
they feel positive about tackling the challenges of digital transformation.
4.6 Many Digitalization Obstacles Are Home-Grown
The “innovator’s dilemma,” a phenomenon described by Christensen (2016), is a
significant impediment to digitalization in companies. It refers to the tendency of
successful companies to defend their products and services against newer
technologies if these technologies threaten their existing business model. Software
companies that have primarily sold licenses fear that their sales will decline if they
instead offer their software as a service and invoice customers based on usage.
Automobile manufacturers fear that their sales will decline if they no longer sell
their cars but instead bring in a car-sharing concept. Along with the fear of
cannibalizing their existing business model, managers are afraid they will lose
personal authority if they introduce a new business model and new technologies.
If they have achieved success on the basis of their skills and experience with the
existing business model, they might be squeezed out by the experts of the new era.
For this reason, established companies usually hesitate to embrace disruptive
digitalization and instead tend to take a cautious approach – if they take any
approach at all.
Apparently serious arguments about the lack of data security offered by new
technologies should also be viewed with a certain degree of skepticism. This
argument is frequently trotted out when it comes to using cloud solutions, and
Germany is especially sensitive in this regard.
Without dismissing these concerns, it is important to remember that if
companies hesitate too long, there is a risk that both the users of digitalization
and the developers of digitalized products and business models will lose ground to
international competitors. This discussion must therefore be conducted with a sense
of proportion and rationality. If users in Germany are too cautious, fewer offers will
be developed here, and we should not be surprised if such offers are then created
overseas instead and do not fit with our legal system or business regulations.
Looking at this issue rationally, we can also see that the same standards are not
being applied everywhere. How else can we explain why an industrial company
would be skeptical of the data security of a cloud solution while simultaneously
sending unencrypted CAD data between different sites by e-mail?
Government also tends to defend existing concepts rather than promote disruptive
new approaches to digitalization. For instance, copyright law has prevented or
impeded many new Internet services. No one takes into account that this legal
construct is just a few 100 years old and arose with printing technology. But if it
arose with a technology, it can be modified with a new technology. Many authors
and musicians are now voluntarily foregoing copyright remuneration and offering
4 Theses on Digitalization 37
their work for free online through YouTube and similar platforms. They have
adapted their business model and are gaining more benefit from wider publicity
(and the more lucrative live performances that go along with it) than they would
from meager royalties. It is understandable that publishers would cling to their
copyright revenues as long as possible and try to influence legislation on this. But
they themselves know that they are fighting a losing battle, which is why they are
building up their digital business at the same time.
Services such as Uber have also been prohibited – or at least impeded – by
passenger transportation regulations. This has been done to protect the traditional
taxi industry, even though this industry once unscrupulously squeezed out horsedrawn
carriages.
Road traffic regulations are making it difficult to carry out extensive practical
tests for driverless cars. As a result, driverless agricultural vehicles are now being
used on farms and are more highly digitalized than passenger cars.
It is important to stress once again that supply and demand must be taken into
account in each of these cases. If we delay or hinder the demand for digital services,
there will be fewer startups in Germany and fewer established companies offering
such services. Instead, these services will be developed in more receptive countries.
This will result in economic losses, and it also means we will not be able to play a
part in shaping these developments and will instead have to use foreign systems
which might not meet our expectations.
The German government has acknowledged the importance of this development
with its “Digital Agenda.” The annual IT summit is a meeting point for politicians,
scientists and businesspeople to discuss advances in digitalization.
4.7 Jeremy Rifkin Is Right: And Hopefully Wrong
In his bestsellers The Third Industrial Revolution and The Zero Marginal Cost
Society (cf. Rifkin 2014), successful author and futurist Jeremy Rifkin highlighted
some fundamental economic developments which could be brought about by
digitalization.
His main theories are:
– Digitalization and general technical advances are giving rise to more and more
new products which can be produced at practically zero marginal costs.
– The capitalist economic system is giving way to a society characterized by
sharing and common use (the sharing economy and the collaborative commons).
– Digitalization will destroy many jobs and lead to unemployment.
It is obvious that production at low marginal costs leads to a decline in prices for
products and services. In keeping with Moore’s Law, it is now possible to store data
38 A.-W. Scheer
and carry out calculations at practically no cost (cf. Moore 1965). The same applies
to communication services (such as making telephone calls with Skype). Educational
content can also be delivered over the Internet via Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCS) at almost zero marginal cost. Mobility (e.g., Uber) and overnight
accommodation (e.g., Airbnb) are now available at zero marginal cost as well.
This applies to renewable energy, too, and the creation of physical products by
means of 3D printing with simple materials (e.g., sand).
Overall, this will lead to a sharing economy in which access to products is more
important than ownership of them. In the USA, the “millennium” generation which
is responsible for this new behavior is estimated to be around 80 million people.
Many of them already “work” as Uber drivers or part-time consultants and use
Airbnb for overnight accommodation. They have no permanent employment contract
and thus no ties to a particular company; instead, they offer their services as
freelancers over the Internet. This means that they produce small units of work for
multiple clients at the same time. This type of work demands new kinds of social
safeguards in the event of unemployment, illness, retirement or disability, an issue
which is already being discussed by politicians in the USA. The flexibilization of
the working world has also led to the term “gig economy.” Musicians use the word
“gig” to describe a performance, and the gig economy is characterized by varied,
short-term assignments. In Germany, the organization and experiences of the
K€unstlersozialkasse (social welfare fund for artists) could be used as a template
for social safeguards in the gig economy.
Digitalization will make many office and factory jobs obsolete. This will particularly
affect medium-skilled workers. Whether this will lead to major unemployment
problems is debatable, however. New digital services will also spring up,
resulting in the creation of new jobs. Years of experience have shown that while
technical progress can cause labor problems in the short term, it creates new
employment opportunities in the medium term – as the current shortage of skilled
labor shows.
It is also unlikely that the market economy will collapse. The sharing economy
will certainly become a reality in some areas, but it will not dominate the entire
economic system.
4.8 Technologies Are Becoming Services
The development of new digital services is an important driver of digitalization.
The trend towards a sharing economy indicates that, for many products, the focus is
not on ownership but on access to their functionality. This means that a product can
be available on a rotating basis to many consumers. Consumers will no longer need
to buy a car in order to use it, but can instead make use of the mobility services
offered by car-sharing providers. In economic terms, this takes advantage of
centralization and economies of scale. The Internet makes it possible to provide
these services at a low cost and in a short period of time.
4 Theses on Digitalization 39
The tendency for technologies to be utilized as services is not new. In the
nineteenth century, many craft enterprises supplied their own energy using water,
wind, steam or electricity, and they even had their own water wells. Later on,
energy and water supply companies emerged which offered energy and water
centrally as a service and issued bills based on usage.
This development continues today and is driven by information technology.
Many industrial companies are turning into service providers. This transformation
has been fueled by the fact that many technical products have become increasingly
difficult for occasional users to comprehend and manufacturers are better suited for
operating these products. A manufacturer of agricultural equipment can offer
driverless, satellite-guided harvesting services more professionally while also
arranging for the crops to be transported by its own vehicles. By accessing the
data from all of its devices, the manufacturer can contrast and optimize their use
worldwide. The manufacturer thus has an ability to gather and analyze data which is
not available to the individual user.
Analyzing large volumes of data (“big data”) generally opens up the opportunity
for new services and startups. While the term business intelligence (BI) was once
used to refer to data analytics with an eye to past performance, direct access to
current data now makes it possible to respond to events immediately or take
measures proactively. Predictive maintenance is one example of this: Analyzing
the current behavior of a machine – which could easily have 100 to 200 sensors
attached to it for monitoring energy consumption, speed, equipment status or the
attributes of the component – can reveal an imminent need for maintenance. The
equipment manufacturer itself can offer maintenance services and compare the
behavior of all of its products, thus gaining an information advantage over an
individual user with a different maintenance policy. Startups can specialize in
sophisticated analysis techniques and work together with users and system
providers here.
4.9 How Do You Get Started with Digitalization?
Because digitalization affects all of a company’s existing products and processes
while also making it possible to develop new products, services and processes, a
company-wide digitalization strategy is a complex project.
Such a project can only be realized bit by bit. The question is how these bits
should be defined and in which order they should be tackled. First, the company’s
core processes and main products must be identified. With an I4.0 strategy, logistics,
product development and manufacturing are the main processes that will be
further divided into sub-processes. The maturity-level approach is helpful for
prioritizing the processes to be analyzed and digitalized. To begin with, the
categories of “better,” “same” and “worse” are used to determine how a company’s
processes currently stack up against those of the competition. Then the required
investment amounts are estimated. These are also roughly assigned to the categories
of “low,” “moderate” and “high.” The competitive gap and investment categories
40 A.-W. Scheer
can now be compared in a matrix. This is a good basis for discussion. It certainly
makes little sense to prioritize the digitalization of a process which already has a
competitive advantage and would take a great deal of investment to digitalize.
Conversely, it is worth digitalizing a process that is lagging behind the competition
and would require a low investment. Of course, digitalization must fundamentally
improve the process in question.
A second approach (cf. Scheer 2015) compares the necessary investment with
the innovative potential offered by digitalization. In this case, digitalization with
high innovative potential and low investment requirements will trump digitalization
with low innovative potential and high investment costs.
These financial considerations still leave room for entrepreneurial and visionary
ideas which are hard to express in numbers. This makes digitalization exciting, and
it is what creates winners and losers as well as opportunities for startups.
4.10 The World Is Becoming Flat
One common way of reducing the complexity of a problem is to structure it. For
example, when you want to write a book, you first draw up a hierarchical outline
and base your writing on that.
Simplifying hierarchical structural models exist for companies, too. For industrial
enterprises, these models may take the form of hierarchical levels: the field,
where the sensors are attached to a machine component; the machine controller,
such as a PLC; the station, such as a machine; the workshop, such as a flexible
manufacturing system; and the company. The information architecture and flow of
information are also geared towards these hierarchical levels. For instance, production
orders are generated by the ERP system on the company level, transmitted to
the workshop and sent from there via manufacturing execution systems (MES) to
the production facilities. These assign the appropriate NC programs and activate
sensors and actuators. The return flow of information is also traditionally based on
this hierarchy.
The influence of the I4.0 concept makes it difficult to maintain this hierarchy. If a
sensor determines that a machine is no longer working with the necessary precision,
a message can be sent directly from the machine’s PLC to the order management
system in the ERP system indicating that the customer order will be delayed. At the
same time, it can request a new order which requires less precision. Horizontally,
the controller can ask the PLC of another system if it can take over the order that
was started – that is, whether it can guarantee the required level of precision. In
principle, every component can communicate with every other component, making
hierarchies largely obsolete.
The same applies in the fields of logistics and administration. Here, too, the flow
of information is geared towards processes, not hierarchies. Employees from
different departments can communicate with each other directly, without directing
the flow of information through their respective superiors.
4 Theses on Digitalization 41
With the mytaxi app, passengers communicate directly with the taxi driver,
without involving a taxi dispatcher.
A distributor’s vehicles can independently report their expected arrival time at
the customer’s front gate, without involving the distributor’s dispatch department or
the customer’s incoming goods department.
In terms of systems technology, users employ all kinds of devices, including
smartphones, tablets, notebooks and computers. The application systems must be
adapted to this mixture of channels and always be responsive. Because they must
continually react to events, the systems should effectively respond in realtime and
according to defined rules. In this respect, too, they must always be responsive. The
business-process-as-a-service (BPaaS) architecture developed by Scheer GmbH
follows these principles (cf. Scheer 2015).
Information and communication structures are increasingly taking the form of
horizontal networks in which every node can communicate with every other node
through its logical link to the business process. As a result, the business process –
and not the hierarchical structure – becomes the guiding principle. Standards such
as the OPC Unified Architecture for securely exchanging data between different
systems and hierarchies are helpful and necessary here.
In general, the world is becoming “flat” and more complex. Because of this, it is
increasingly important to document (model) business processes on the type level
and to track and store them on the instance level. All business processes – with their
data, statuses and changes throughout their life cycle – can be stored in a process
memory so that they are available for analysis and compliance with governance
criteria. Transparency is becoming the key element of control.
4.11 Software Is Eating the World
This comment by Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape and developer of the
Mosaic browser, hits the nail on the head. Software is the most important resource
in the digital world. Software is revolutionizing existing processes and bringing
about new services. It is also being used to manage and analyze data. Control over
software is thus becoming the most important corporate resource. Industrial
companies that have always thought their construction and production engineers
were their most important knowledge resource are starting to change. They are
hiring more and more software engineers, purchasing software companies or
spinning off their own IT departments into independent companies in order to
give them a clearer focus and expose them to the innovative pressures of the market.
Other industries are moving in the same direction. Publishers are expanding their
Internet business and becoming software companies. And faced with the existential
threat of Internet commerce, retailers are having to take action themselves in order
to avoid being squeezed out.
Digitalization will be the biggest revolution of the twenty-first century.

The Cloud in the Driver’s Seat 5
Guido Reinking
No other industry is changing as quickly as the auto industry. And nobody – apart
from the IT and telecoms sector – is pushing harder toward the cloud. Automobile
manufacturers and marketers are under great pressure to become mobility service
providers. This change is being driven by trends such as the electrification of the
drive train as well as the political and social pressures to make mobility as
sustainable as possible. And for some time now, innovation in the industry has
not come from the core areas of mechanical engineering, thermodynamics, chemistry
or physics, but from electronics and software development. The German auto
makers are aware of this. But are they doing anything about it?
Not without some justification, the industry now expects advances of historic
proportions – at least in their manufacturing processes. It is no coincidence,
therefore, that even the CEOs of European automakers were showing an interest
in robots at the recent IZB International Suppliers Fair. More specifically, they were
looking for robots capable of working alongside people. After all, robotics technology
is part of a phenomenon that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
calls “The Second Machine Age” and in Germany is known as Industry 4.0. But
even this, the biggest development in the automotive industry since the introduction
of the assembly line and lean production, is only part of an even bigger change. As a
result of the digitalization of all areas of our lives, the mobile Internet and the
widespread networking of technical devices throughout the value chain, Germany’s
key industry, responsible for one in seven of the country’s jobs, is facing a crucial
test. New suppliers from the IT industry with new business models are forcing their
way into the automakers’ established customer relationships. Some have even
started building cars, although Elon Musk, the founder of electric car pioneers
Tesla, considers these to be more like an “iPhone on wheels” than a means of
transportation.

These “mobile devices” must be designed, produced, programmed, marketed
and serviced differently from the cars we are familiar with today. This is not just
because the IT industry is keen to increase its share of the automotive industry’s
value chain but because a new generation of customers is coming through, and they
have different requirements. In the future, simply selling cars will no longer work as
a business model. Customers want mobility and are prepared to spend money to get
it. But investing 20,000, 40,000 or even 60,000 euros in something that stands
unused outside your door for 22 h a day seems pointless, particularly to the younger
generation of motorists. This is one of the catalysts of recent success stories being
written by mobility providers like Car-to-go, DriveNow and Uber.
No wonder that the impact of the digital world on the automotive business has
become a burning issue for the industry. Today, every mid-size car carries more
software on board than an Airbus A 320. This has one serious consequence:
Although all the automotive manufacturers have gone shopping in Silicon Valley
and are acquiring software and hardware companies and vast numbers of
programmers, they must appreciate that, without the help of external IT companies,
they will not get very far. These specialists are needed for tasks such as integrating
new apps, or tracking down large numbers of developers from all over the world
and quickly checking their competence for the automotive sector. “We can never
keep up with tens of thousands of programmers,” said Wolfgang Ziebart, who was
the Technical Director at Jaguar Land Rover until March 2015 and a former CEO of
Infineon. “The automakers have to successfully win over the application developer
community to their cause. This is fundamental to success.”
5.1 The Pressure Is Enormous
The “big boys” of the Internet are already poised to overtake the established
automakers if they fail to become more agile in the IT stakes. Google has already
launched its “self-driving” car. It conforms to young people’s notion of buying
mobility as and when you need it rather than owning your own expensive vehicle.
Apple’s plans for a car have attracted the attention of Wolfsburg, Munich and
Stuttgart, although VW, BMW and Daimler as well as truck manufacturers like
MAN have been road testing autonomous vehicles for some time now. According to
a survey carried out by vehicle finance company Lease Trend, one out of every four
of today’s car buyers can imagine purchasing or using a Google or Apple car. What
makes the prognosis even more painful is that these customers are mostly male,
above-average earners – the traditional target demographic of the German premium
car brands.
But perhaps the threat from Silicon Valley is this: If you don’t let us into your
cars with our business models, we’ll just build our own. One thing is certain: OEMs
around the world – from Ford to VW to Toyota – are working feverishly on their
own IT strategies, apps and products. According to a study by Roland Berger
Strategy Consultants, the global market for driver-assisted system software alone
will be worth as much as 20 billion US dollars by 2030. Market research company
46 G. Reinking
Juniper Research predicts that the number of apps used in vehicles worldwide will
grow to around 270 million by 2018. In 2013 there were only 54 million. And
according to another survey, car buyers are willing to spend more than 3,000 euros
for safety-enhancing advanced driver assistance systems. The question is, who will
develop these software solutions and capture the lion’s share of the business – the
car makers and their suppliers or the big Internet and technology companies? Tesla
manager Philipp Schr€oder is in no doubt: “The companies in Silicon Valley rightly
believe that they will decide the future of the automobile.” That is why Tesla sees
itself more as a software developer than as a car manufacturer.
How have the manufacturers been reacting to this? Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche
recently recalled how a new technology had turned the rules of the mobility market
on their head once before. It took only 25 years for steam engines to be replaced by
diesel and electrically powered locomotives. None of the steam engine
manufacturers survived the transformation of engine technologies in the rail industry.
“That will not happen to us,” promises Zetsche. His company has a clear
“commitment to innovation.”
BMW was also quick to recognize the need for change when it set up the
Project-i with its own in-house team to develop concepts for the new world of the
automobile. Cars like the i3 and the i8 are the most visible manifestation of a new
era, although the newly developed IT architecture concealed beneath the carbonfiber
bodies is likely to be of greater significance for the company’s future than the
electric cars themselves.
5.2 Industry 4.0: The New Machine Age
Human-machine interaction is an important aspect of the networked, highly
automated production environment known as Industry 4.0. The sheer pace of
digitalization and networking is leading to an innovation leap in robotics technology.
Sensors, actuators, controllers and image processing are becoming more
powerful and less expensive. “Robots that can help production staff by taking
over heavy physical work will be a common feature of the factory of the future.
Their strengths of power and mechanical precision perfectly enhance the
human characteristics of flexibility, intelligence and sensitivity,” saysHarald Kr€uger,
CEO of BMW since May 2015.
The fact that more and more robots are taking over jobs that were previously
carried out by people is not just due to the employers’ concern for the health of their
employees. The German babyboomers, born during the post-World War II baby
boom, will be retiring over the next ten years. When they do, BMW, Daimler and
VW will find it difficult to find qualified people to fill the posts they leave vacant.
“Over the next few years, the children of the Economic Miracle will be turning
60 and then going into retirement,” says Horst Neumann, Volkswagen Board
Member with responsibility for Human Resources. “Between 2015 and 2030 we
will see an extraordinary number of employees leaving the company due to
retirement.” This is why VW is looking into the possibility of replacing people
5 The Cloud in the Driver’s Seat 47
with robots without increasing the unemployment rate, which is what happened in
many companies in the 1980s and 1990s.
Also, automation brings another benefit. Labor costs in the German auto industry,
at about 40 euros per hour, are three to four times higher than in Eastern Europe
and China. A robot can do an assembly job for between 3 and 6 euros an hour –
including maintenance and wear and tear – and its deployment will ultimately
secure the jobs of a fair number of human workers.VW manager Neumann believes
that the use of robots increases the demand for skilled workers, foremen and
engineers with IT skills. In the future, staff will not be required to carry out
heavy physical work, but brainwork. Volkswagen has had robots working side by
side with people for some time now in its various plants.
The German automakers are confident that they are leading the world with
Industry 4.0 – particularly since they also have the support of some highly capable
machine tool and IT companies. SAP and Telekom have already formed a consortium
to set standards for the new automation and networking processes in
manufacturing. The idea is to develop a closed process chain, from development,
to the component supply companies and manufacturers, right through to service.
This will provide the first end-to-end documentation of when, where and how a part
from a particular supplier was installed in a particular vehicle, thus simplifying the
work of the dealership’s service department. According to a PwC study, the
digitalization of the automotive industry’s value chain will increase both horizontally
and vertically over the next five years from the current 20 percent to over
80 percent. Volkswagen has already introduced a product data management software
throughout the Group that depicts a continuous digital process chain from the
design of a component through to its manufacture.
But modern production processes like these are not without their risks. Industrial
espionage is a more serious problem for the automotive industry than most. Intelligence
about what new technologies and models the industry giants currently have
under development could be worth a lot of money to some of their competitors.
Developers are therefore skeptical about sharing their data with OEM suppliers and
the production department. This skepticism is what led Daimler to become one of
the first German companies to employ its own team of experienced hackers.
Working from a secret location, they carry out attacks on their own employer in
order to quickly identify vulnerabilities in the company’s internal network.
“Although most hacker attacks last only a few hours, it often takes months before
they are detected”. Daimler plans to become much more adept at this game of
catch-up and is also imposing more stringent security standards on its suppliers.
One of the issues it is looking into is the security of its web-enabled machinery.
Robots are considered particularly vulnerable to attack because they are not as well
protected as office workstations. Security experts are already concerned that
hackers could use this vulnerability to disrupt the production of entire plants,
causing damage worth millions of euros. It is every production manager’s
nightmare.
48 G. Reinking
5.3 Networking: Cars Driving in the Cloud
Networked assembly shops, development centers and OEM suppliers are not the
only places that need protection from hacker attacks in Industry 4.0. In the future,
every car that is permanently connected to the Internet – whether or not it is
traveling on the road – will be a target for computer criminals, viruses and trojans.
BMW has learned this to its cost, and even the successful Tesla S electric car from
the USA has already been cracked by hackers. They were able to get into the car
using the keyless entry system and the mobile app, open the doors and operate the
horn and the lights. This is a frightening scenario, particularly for the self-driving
cars that the manufacturers and component suppliers have been working so hard on.
Since Bosch introduced the first electronic fuel injection system in the 1970s,
cars have slowly been evolving into traveling computers. Today, the average luxury
car is equipped with 70 control units connected to three km of cable weighing a total
of 60 kg. Until a few years ago, the IT was only connected inside the car and not to
the outside world. This has now changed radically.
80 percent of new cars are already networked. In a few years, it will be 100
percent. Networking is integral to fleet management solutions like Car Energy
Manager, which connects fleet operators but also individual vehicles with the
charging infrastructure available en route to optimize their control. Another reason
networking has become so important is that vehicles are increasingly becoming
places for “connected life and work.” Even today, customers take their digital
identities with them into the car via their smartphones. For the automakers, who
have always differentiated their products on the basis of their mechanical
characteristics, this marks the dawning of a new era. Rather than horsepower,
driving comfort or wide tires, what the young target group wants is to be able to
use at least some of their cherished smartphone apps in the car.
Automobile manufacturers have to respond to this, or they run the risk of being
left behind. “We spend three years developing a new car, five years producing it,
and it then spends ten years driving on the roads,” says Wolfgang Ziebart, former
Engineering Director at Jaguar Land Rover. This is the auto industry’s dilemma: No
matter how intelligent the infotainment solution, a car will never be up-to-date
when a dozen new generations of smartphones will be released during its lifetime.
The solution that this long-established British manufacturer found for this problem
is now shared by nearly all automobile manufacturers. Instead of selling the
customer an expensive infotainment installation with GPS navigation, a large
screen and a digital radio, which can easily account for 20 percent of the price of
a small or compact car, they provide a connection from the driver’s smartphone to a
screen in the center console. This enables the customer to use all the non-distracting
apps that have been approved by the manufacturer. This is why Jaguar only installs
in their cars “those functions that are needed when there is no smartphone on
board.”
Drivers can use the smartphone’s Incontrol apps to navigate, listen to music,
manage their diary, book a hotel room or retrieve messages. Thanks to its link to the
5 The Cloud in the Driver’s Seat 49
car, the smartphone always knows the car’s location, whether it is locked up, or how
far the car can travel on the current tank of fuel.
Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW and Audi are also pursuing a strategy of
smartphone integration. The industry has recognized that networking the automobile
requires new business models. The strategy of selling outrageously expensive
infotainment solutions, which are less capable than any iPhone or Android phone
and which quickly become obsolete anyway, is no longer sustainable. The ability of
easily updatable systems like Mirror Link (smartphone connectivity), CarPlay
(Apple) and Android Auto (Google) to effectively integrate the smartphone in the
car’s infotainment system offers the auto industry a magic bullet.
The update capability of IT systems is a key concern for manufacturers. Because
new car buyers are not the only ones who want a car that is up-to-date. New cars
will suffer a huge loss in resale value if the car’s IT solutions look as ancient as an
old cassette deck next to an mp3 player. Just a two percent drop in the resale value
of the trade’s used car inventory equates to a loss for the industry of around one
billion euros (Source: own calculation). Even now, navigation systems whose maps
have to be updated with complex and expensive DVDs are barely able to command
any premium at all. On the contrary: An obsolete GPS reduces the price of a used
car. The car of the future will update its software via the Internet. Online navigation
allows permanent access to the latest maps, including realtime traffic information.
The automakers’ efforts to establish their own business models in order to stay in
control of developments recently prompted a fierce takeover struggle for Nokia’s
Here mapping service. Lasting several months, it involved a consortium of German
premium manufacturers – Audi, BMW and Daimler – and non-auto industry
bidders including Facebook and the taxi service Uber. Here is considered to be
the only service provider capable of seriously competing with Google’s mapping
service. This was a battle for data. And Here has a lot of data. Each road is linked to
400 items of information – from the number of lanes, to speed limits, through to
restaurants and shops. The information is stored in Nokia’s Location Cloud data
center ready for retrieval. It is clearly not possible to handle such large amounts of
data in the car, let alone keep them updated. The car of the future will therefore run
not just on the roads but also in dedicated car clouds.
Unlike current car navigation systems and smartphone GPS apps, which only
display a small portion of the available data, the networked, highly automated
autonomous driving cloud platforms collect, process and aggregate a variety of
sensor data and environmental information and can make this information available
in realtime to large numbers of vehicles. It is therefore no surprise that “big data”,
the constantly expanding volume of data generated by vehicles on the move, is
keeping the industry on its toes: Volkswagen has set up its own data lab in Munich
specifically to deal with big data. Big data offers the possibility of many of the
business models that marketing professionals could once only dream about:
Motorists being guided to restaurants which pay for the privilege, for example or
guidance to the nearest available car park. “A car can detect where the free parking
spaces are in a town and pass this information on to other vehicles,” says Ulrich
Eichhorn, Technical Director of the VDA. Thirty percent of the traffic in cities is
50 G. Reinking
cars cruising for parking, says Eichhorn. A system that shows drivers where the
nearest free parking spaces are could prevent much of this traffic. “A large automobile
manufacturer could provide that information exclusively to its customers.” Or
sell it to third parties for a fee.
Business models like these are currently firing imaginations in the industry.
Some are based on advanced driver assistance systems which – like AutoApp
launched at the IAA – also provide location-specific driving recommendations in
realtime along with a variety of other services such as weather, service station and
emergency services information. There is another reason why the automobile
manufacturers have no intention of letting Silicon Valley gain ownership of the
screen in the car without a fight. “It is the manufacturers who decide which
operating system is used in their cars and there is no reason to believe that this
will change in the future,” says Audi Chairman Rupert Stadler. Given that many of
the in-car features affect safety, maintenance and driver assistance, the industry will
not be told what to do. This is particularly true for the most complex of all the
electronic assistants, the driverless car. The launch of Google’s self-driving car
caused the established automakers in Europe, Asia and the United States to redouble
their work in this area.
No one in the industry is prepared to give a definite date for the arrival of fully
piloted driving – even though the technology will soon be ready. The first hurdle is
the lack of clarity with regard to liability. Who pays when a driverless car causes an
accident – the user or the manufacturer? Some technological hurdles have already
been overcome, however. The autopilot cannot be allowed to make mistakes when
driving the vehicle. The rule is therefore: Quality of development has priority over
speed of development.
Driverless cars must have a reliable, fast Internet connection if they are to travel
safely in environments other than near parking garages or downtown areas. They
also need “artificial intelligence.” A driver knows intuitively that there is always a
risk of a child leaving a group of children and running out onto the road. Because of
their experience, people have a huge advantage over machines, which may be able
to react 20 times faster but remain blind in many situations despite their laser
scanners and image analyzers. The Centre of Automotive Research at Stanford
University has worked out that it takes seven years from gaining a license before a
driver can anticipate traffic situations safely. Yet people cause 90 percent of all
traffic accidents. Nobody would allow that kind of an error rate in a robotic car.
5.4 New Technology: New Skepticism?
The insurance companies are keeping a close eye on these developments, even
though they continue to base their new business models on the number one cause of
accidents – the driver. Some insurers are now starting to offer “pay as you drive”
premiums. A black box in the car constantly monitors the driver’s actions and the
vehicle location. Anyone who is prepared to abide by the rules or who as a newly
qualified driver avoids high-risk activities such as Saturday night cruising pays a
5 The Cloud in the Driver’s Seat 51
cheaper premium. Since the provider in question was given the “Big Brother
Award” for its obsession with collecting data, however, the insurance industry in
Germany has grown more cautious and is now reluctant to offer insurance policies
of this type.
While the Americans and Chinese are quick to see the opportunities these new
technologies offer, the Germans are more concerned with their risks. More specifically,
the still unresolved matter of data privacy, which puts restrictions on many
business models. The data that is already being generated by every networked car is
certainly being eyed with great interest by many companies.
But who owns the data? Even the lawyers cannot agree. While consumer
organizations claim that “motorists basically own the data in their cars,” Kasselbased
law professor Alexander Roßnagel writes in a paper: “Automotive data is
intangible information and therefore not subject to the rules of ownership and
possession.”
When workshops service cars nowadays, they read out the vehicle data and error
codes. This data is already being passed on online. This is why Mercedes development
chief Thomas Weber promises, “When developing the fully networked
vehicle, we were mindful of the issue of data protection from the outset. The car
of the future will include an increasing number of IT-based features. It will
therefore have to offer more than just safe and reliable transportation: It will also
have to guarantee the security of its data.” Careful and secure data handling is
considered to be a key factor in the acceptance of new technologies.
As the industry leaders are well aware, the more benefits data processing can
offer the motorist, the greater its acceptability will be. Surveys have revealed that a
huge number of motorists believe in the importance of passing on data that
contributes to traffic safety. They have no problem with data that alerts other road
users to hazards, congestion and accidents. This could easily change if the driver
starts to see unwanted offers in his display from restaurants, shops and service
stations that are aware that he is in the vicinity.
On the whole, however, car owners are willing to allow their vehicles to be
networked if it leads to an improvement in comfort and quality of life. A case in
point is the “Smart Home Integration” feature on the BMW Connected Drive
platform, which automatically increases the room temperature in the driver’s
home as soon he approaches. Similarly, who could argue against a vehicle that
can detect wear and tear and arrange with the workshop to have the brake pads
exchanged? Such services are already being offered as independent aftermarket
solutions.
A new era is dawning for the more than 33,000 automobile workshops in
Germany. Experts from the Volkswagen Data Lab in Munich have used big data
technology to develop a model for forecasting spare parts requirements. To do this,
they looked at more than 32 million records and developed an algorithm that is able
to predict the parts required for an entire range up to 15 years after production has
been discontinued. IT can now even predict when a vehicle needs to be serviced.
Vehicle data can also be used to achieve a long-held dream of all automobile
vendors: producing an accurate needs analysis. What vehicle and what engine does
52 G. Reinking
the customer actually need to meet his mobility needs? And would he be better off
with a gasoline, diesel or electric vehicle?
5.5 Even Car Dealerships Need to Reequip
But before those plans for the future are implemented, these car dealerships will
have to get to grips with the digital marketing and sales channels that are already
with us today. And in order to maintain their customer relationships, the dealerships
will also have to increase their use of IT with solutions such as Product Lifecycle
Management (PLM), Customer Experience Management (CEM), and so on. Cloud
services covering the entire lifecycle of customer relationships, available around
the clock via a mobile platform, will connect the customer with the automobile
manufacturer, the auto dealership, the vehicle of his choice, and the dealer
workshop.
Large volumes of data that can only be processed in the cloud and that require
fast, stable data connections are rapidly changing the auto trade landscape. In their
expensive, prestige city locations, Audi, BMW and Mercedes now show most of
their new models on large flat screens and tablets – in addition to a small number of
actual cars. All the vehicle data for these models has been digitally edited. Audi
City in London has set aside 17 terabytes on their servers for the purpose. “The auto
trade,” says BMW Board Member Ian Robertson, “is changing as rapidly as the
products it is selling.” BMW calls this process “Future Retail” – the approach to
displaying products virtually that has already become the norm in many of the
showrooms of the Group’s brands.
Digital sales is not the only area where you find huge volumes of data: “The
quantity of data that a self-driving car produces can quickly reach the multi-terabyte
range. This is too much for the vehicle to process comfortably and certainly too
much for it to store,” says Thomas Schiller, Partner in the Deloitte consulting firm.
There is still no solution for the infrastructure investment that will be needed, says
Schiller. Storing the data in the car would currently fill the entire trunk. Despite this,
in-car computers are becoming increasingly powerful: Processors with nearly
200 cores, as announced by Audi at the CES in Las Vegas, were previously used
only in supercomputers.
A number of ambitious projects have drawn attention to one area where networking
falls short: the infrastructure. Take the European launch of eCall, for
example. This system, which automatically transfers an emergency call on the
EU-wide number 112 to the nearest control center, was supposed to have been
launched in 2015 but has now been postponed until 2018. Unfortunately, many EU
countries simply lack the technology needed to receive the emergency signal,
which contains the vehicle’s GPS information, the number of occupants and the
direction of travel. The signal is triggered as soon as a vehicle’s airbags deploy.
5 The Cloud in the Driver’s Seat 53
Even faster mobile networks are needed to ensure that networked mobility has
sufficient bandwidth and capacity. At the moment, LTE is the fastest standard but in
2020 we will see the arrival of the fifth generation (5G) offering data rates up to
one GB per second – ten times faster than the current LTE standard.
5.6 Conclusion: An Industry in Transition
German automakers and their suppliers are making good progress with Industry 4.0.
However, the IT industry has the edge when it comes to networking the car and
delivering applications to the car from the cloud. It remains uncertain, therefore,
whether the mobility products of the future will come from Stuttgart, Bavaria or
Wolfsburg – or from Silicon Valley. In the major and large cities, where half of
humanity currently lives, vehicle ownership is in decline. In those places where
there are high sales volumes and driving involves more stress than pleasure,
competitive advantage is no longer measured in horsepower but in gigabytes and
megabits per second. The Internet and the cloud have changed the way we obtain
our information, in the same way as the car changed our mobility. The result will be
automobiles that drive themselves, communicate with our immediate environment
and with other vehicles via fast links to the cloud and are emission- and accidentfree.

Frank Strecker and J€orn Kellermann
The cloud is a trendsetter, an enabler of new business models and the engine driving
digitalization. But what does a cloud model capable of actually leveraging this new
potential for businesses and the economy at large really look like in practice? An
awareness of digital strategies in the minds of decision-makers is just one side of the
coin – although it is a very important one. Beyond this, however, the right
organizational setup – both technical and strategic – is also essential, and this is
an issue that affects both IT service providers and all other companies alike.
Partnerships (both inside and outside the company’s own sector) are a key element
here, as is having the right sales strategy across new digital channels. Last but not
least, a foundation must also be laid that enables future-proof digital models in the
first place: data center technology in the form of virtual IT resources, provided as
infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) to appropriately serve the principles of simplicity,
security and affordability. Here, the factors of availability and scalability also play
another important role. Digital sales concepts, partnering, IT delivery models and
security and/or data protection issues are therefore topics that must be scrutinized
closely in the context of new ideas and innovations before these can grow into
successful business models. This chapter takes a two-pronged look at these topics.

6.1 Joining Forces, Leveraging Strengths: Partnering
in the Cloud
The comprehensive phase of transformation that first forced telecoms and IT
companies to adapt has long since reached other types of businesses. Sooner or
later, the digital transformation will come to affect every company in every
industry. For IT companies, however, it’s the chance of a lifetime: IT is no
commodity, but is the foundation of new and successful business models. And
this is where cloud is critical: It is the technological basis for the agility that today’s
markets ask for – and which tomorrow’s markets will demand. Whether we are
talking about interconnecting industrial machinery, managing large volumes of data
or setting up global platforms for thousands of employees worldwide: Companies’
handling of the digitalization challenge depends heavily on the availability of
scalable, highly flexible systems. Whatever their industry, only the cloud can
pave the way for digitalized business processes, products and corporate strategies
that “think digital” – and thus ultimately uncover new potential for sales. While it
certainly creates a platform that makes it easier to reach, understand and network
with customers, the cloud also presents companies with a compelling challenge:
They must modernize and stabilize their IT so it can guarantee both speed and
scalability when providing these innovative services. Not least because target
markets need to be addressed via these digital channels with tailor-made offers
for innovative products. This cannot be done in isolation but needs the right
ecosystem and thus the right partners. Forced to go it alone, even an IT company
wouldn’t succeed in this role for long – as a standalone provider, so to speak.
Partnering is therefore a key element in the sales strategy of companies involved in
digital market developments.
6.1.1 Focus on IT and the Customer
As we have already seen in the preceding chapters, IT (and thus cloud) is a crucial
element of today’s business processes and models – and even more so for those yet
to come. Online banking, driverless cars, efficient production – even basic business
success is now dependent on IT. As are our customers themselves. Cloud-based
solutions are now an indispensable tool for sales channels and customer touch
points. And the modern customer is now also very active online. In this context,
digitalization has long been working to shift the balance of power. For many
modern value chains, it is now the customer that calls the shots. While our
customers are “always on” and very well informed, the business world often still
lags behind – or isn’t as up-to-date in the areas where it counts. There is too little
known about target markets and the types of products they are using. This is a
knowledge gap that has to be bridged. To do so, companies can take a leaf out of the
customer’s book and make the most of digitalization by using the cloud itself as a
sales channel and talking to the target market in its new hangout (so to speak). And
by bringing the right specialists on board when they do so. A cross-sector approach
58 F. Strecker and J. Kellermann
must also be taken: Even long-standing, well-established companies need to offer
target markets extra incentives on new channels and woo them with innovative
products. Accordingly, digitalization doesn’t merely require a transformation of
one’s own business models but also the sales channels, customer communication
and partnership models. So what does this mean in practice for a company’s sales
strategy?
The first step in this process is to establish a solid understanding of current
developments in the market. Not least because digitalization both at home and in
the workplace has brought changes that materially affect company orientation and
demand extraordinary flexibility from every modern business. This can be
summarized as three key trends that currently affect the market:
– Increased transparency: Price comparisons, product/service details, customer
opinions, etc. can all be found online. Customers can research all of the relevant
features for a product down to the last detail and then simply pick out the best
offer from those available. The concept of the supplier or product is history.
– Standards compliance: Fast-moving markets and new concepts in communication
– such as company-wide collaboration systems or the global rollout of
virtual workplace solutions – mean compliance with standards is significantly
more relevant (for reasons of cost-effectiveness alone) than was the case even
just a few years ago.
– Product diversity: Competitors are increasingly offering their products globally
via new channels like online marketplaces. Companies must be much more
flexible and agile when responding to the dynamic markets this creates.
As these trends indicate, increasing demands for market agility and impact
require a highly diversified sales process and strong partnerships. More than ever
before, teamwork is the best strategy for handling the requirements of modern
customers.
6.1.2 Catching Up With the Customer – With Omni-Channel
The days of the traveling salesman with trench coat, hat and oversized suitcase are
long gone. As are those of traditional sales roles, too – whether in field sales or as a
retail salesperson – at least in this particular form and as the sole customer contact.
In the future, the sales process will dispense with this “one of a kind” model:
Instead, the strategy will be to respond directly to customer needs, to be as “always
on” as customers themselves. Take consumer electronics, for example: A couple of
decades ago, a TV, laptop or hi-fi systems manufacturer might have received
customer feedback about the product – whether praise or criticism – from a
salesperson in an electronics dealership. Weeks or months later, or even on his or
her next store visit – assuming the customer stayed loyal to the brand. And the trade
press also published product reviews. But the tempo of customer feedback has now
6 The Cloud in Practice 59
accelerated massively and is more business-critical than ever before. The wider
scope of these discussions now encompasses Internet forums, Facebook or personal
blogs and is backed by photos, videos and approving “likes”. While this can be to a
manufacturer’s advantage – especially if experiences are positive – it is also a
standing, 24/7 invitation to criticize or propose specific product improvements.
These channels not only give consumers access to a brand’s public image but also
put retouching tools into their hands. The company concerned has to respond, and
with the same agility on the exact same channels. And not merely by posting a
comment on a blog but also, if need be, by personally adapting production to the
new demands or developing entirely new products – which are then, in turn,
presented across all available channels. As a next step, this also means that
companies need to see customer feedback in a new light, however. No longer
merely influencing the strategies developed within After Sales or Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) but passed on to production, upstream suppliers or
internal Research & Development (naturally while ensuring strict compliance with
data protection regulations).
In this customer communication context, an omni-channel presence is the order
of the day. An online shop or salesroom alone is simply no longer sufficient. The
2016 Retail Report neatly summarizes the problem by redefining “PoS” as “Point of
Situation”. When retail (for example) needs to get the message across to its
customers, it is no longer just the “how” but the “where” that is relevant. This
requires (for example) sales spaces that are more personal, more flexible and more
adaptable (cf. Zukunftsinstitut 2015). What is more, a package of perfectly coordinated
activities spanning each and every channel – as innovative and intelligent as
possible – is required. The cloud forms the bridge to these new channels. It makes
apps available, offers a platform for anonymous trend analysis based on social
media comments, keeps online shops online even when visitor numbers surge and
provides a foundation for the telepresence or web conferencing solutions that are
now a key customer relationship tool in the context of B2B. In a very real sense, the
cloud is the proximity that is necessary for customer acquisition and loyalty: It not
only facilitates a seamless shopping experience for customers but simultaneously
enables a wider understanding of customer needs. Companies are already well
aware of the need to take appropriate action here: In 2015, the average sum
CEOs at the 250 largest retailers ploughed back into the optimization of omnichannel
fulfillment was an impressive 29 percent of available funds (cf. PWC
2015). And that’s certainly just the beginning.
This is what the new customer experience providing complete peace of mind
could look like: After configuring his dream car on the PC at home, the customer
uses his tablet to add details en route, checking these with the manufacturer directly
via chat. On the journey home, he uses the public screen at the bus stop to go
through options for interior styling, reviewing mock-ups of colors and materials.1
1A digital campaign run by SEAT at bus stops in Barcelona and Madrid: After installing the
mobile app onto their device, customers can then style the interior of the SEAT Ibiza in realtime on
a 75-in. screen at the bus stop.
60 F. Strecker and J. Kellermann
A few days later, he visits the car dealer’s showroom to take his car for a virtual test
drive. With the last few details sorted out, the salesman can actually offer him a
number of extra features that he hasn’t even thought of: The dealer now knows his
customer better than ever – and in ways that simply weren’t possible before. And
that’s not all. After the car is sold, a new kind of customer relationship management
steps in: The cloud now networks the vehicle with the dealer and the repair shop, so
the next service is scheduled entirely automatically and predictively – i.e., before
parts start to show signs of wear. In fact, the vehicle’s probably a self-driving car –
thanks again to the cloud.
The first “digital showrooms” from companies featuring customer interaction
show that this is a concept that works. The Audi City showroom in London has
rewarded Audi with a 70 percent boost to sales figures (cf. Binder und Mortsiefer
2014). BMW is also increasingly investing in showrooms that turn the car driver’s
visit into a unique experience – and 44 percent of customers have already stated
they would be happy to purchase their next car online (cf. Gabler 2015). Mercedes
has also made its mark here, with its “Mercedes me” concept, which includes both
an online shop and flagship stores in major urban centers – opened in 2014 in
Hamburg and 2015 in Milan. Stores are also planned in Moscow and Tokyo, for
example (cf. Behrens 2015).
But the consumer sector isn’t alone in requiring rapid, accurate solutions as
responses to customer requirements: The principle also applies in B2B, where an
omni-channel presence is once again the tool of choice. The range of options
offered by an online sales portal for B2B solutions, for example, lets users configure
and manage their products while providing a direct channel to an expert. The
manufacturer, in turn, can use the portal to create targeted offers or send a sales
expert to a customer on a demand-only basis (rather than posting field sales staff up
and down the country). The goal is the same as before: using first-class care and
cross-channel support to grow alongside one’s customers.
6.1.3 New Models of Collaboration: Team-Based Customer
Acquisition
In the process of reaching and impressing customers – and ideally securing their
long-term loyalty – omni-channel integration can only take you so far, however.
Outstanding agility in the market also requires the pooling of resources. In the “old
world,” customers were used to choosing between just a handful of options. Market
power was shared between monopolists and well-established companies. Today,
however, the global economy means products from around the world are only a
click away. And cross-border business is a self-evident strategy. The erstwhile
office phone – communication channel #1 for decades – has long since been
supplanted by sophisticated, cloud-based infrastructure such as telepresence
systems and high-availability lines, carrying unimaginable quantities of data.
While companies source hardware, software and services from multiple
manufacturers, IT providers offer a single-source model. That’s the cloud concept.
6 The Cloud in Practice 61
And this concept highlights a very important fact: Just because an IT company can
provide the fastest network doesn’t necessarily mean that it develops state-of-theart
hardware and software or knows the right answer to specific conditions that
apply in other countries. Others might be better equipped to do so. Yet together,
everyone can be the best. Partnerships are therefore the be-all and end-all in the
world of digital because a truly integrated solution that offers the customer real
value needs teamwork and a pooling of resources. IT service providers also need to
allow for partner models in their corporate strategies – and with IT manufacturers
and newly formed startups alike. Only then will they be able to offer their customers
sound, reliable and novel solutions. This starts with the software and hardware in
the data center and extends to custom development work with non-sector customer
businesses. In the Connected Car model, for example, IT providers themselves
become parts suppliers – and are likely to be working alongside other competitors.
Odd? Not at all: Since digital models require us to jettison traditional ideas about
the competition.
The upshot is that boundaries between companies and specific sectors are now
increasingly blurred. The cloud concept is gaining ground in each and every
industry, and partnering must become an integral part of every future corporate
strategy – practiced not merely at IT service providers, but with them. Companies
are picking up on this point: In one survey, over 80 percent of companies asked
agreed that systematic implementation of the digital transformation is possible only
in tandem with professional partners (cf. Crisp Research 2015). Ultimately, the goal
here is to satisfy the most demanding technological requirements while complying
with stringent data protection regulations – while simultaneously developing and
further extending core competencies. This goes further than software developers
partnering with hardware manufacturers to offer users a better IT solution: Beverage
producers are also teaming up with vending machine makers, who in turn bring
IT providers on board, to ensure that customers can always be served the right drink
in the right location. The goal is to identify personal preferences as soon as
possible – the Holy Grail is to do so before the preference is even stated. Activities
in this field are driving entirely new B2B2C models. Coca-Cola offers a recent
example: With Freestyle, consumers can mix their perfect drink literally on demand
by using one of the 24,000 interactive beverage dispensers now available on the US
market (cf. T-Systems MMS 2015) – with an iOS/Android app and interfaces to
social networks naturally all part of the package. This effectively brings the drinks
factory to the customer.
Yet these partnerships promise long-term success only if companies back the
right horse in their collaborative ventures. The market is highly dynamic, and the
strengths of its many participants are continuously engaged in a survival of the
fittest: Those who pick the right partners will simply outlive the rest. Accordingly,
companies need to surround themselves with the right ecosystem. A look over the
consumer’s shoulder reveals the importance of being part of the relevant platform:
Facebook, messenger apps, Instagram. These platforms offer very little room for
other models to attract user interest. Things are no different in the world of
business: Only the right kinds of partnerships generate new ideas and products
62 F. Strecker and J. Kellermann
for the ever-demanding users – and thus supply a coveted entrance ticket to market
developments on a global scale. Anyone who is not fast enough here and doesn’t
have the right ideas at the right place and time can quickly drag down other partners
and even bring the entire industry sector to a standstill. Only one other company on
another continent needs to be quicker off the mark and they are then free to corner
the entire market.
6.1.4 Conclusion
The digital transformation is blurring the lines – between industries, between
internal company units, in customer communication and in the sales strategy.
This is creating new challenges and offering many new chances for companies
and the economy at large. To avoid losing customers despite the agility of contemporary
markets and instead respond optimally to their wishes, companies must
promote well-conceived omni-channel marketing and the search for a wellstructured
partner ecosystem to the very top of their agendas. The cloud and the
IT service provider are fundamental links in the chain here: They lay the groundwork
for tomorrow’s customer relationships, for as-yet unheard-of technological
innovation and the future development of entire industries.
6.2 Cloud Operations: What Are the Real Priorities in Practice?
As Apple has shown us, digital growth is always powered by IT – and this is
virtually synonymous with the cloud. With its characteristic attributes of high
availability, flexibility and scalability, the cloud has shifted technological progress
into overdrive – and yet we are still nowhere near its theoretical top speed. One
thing is certain: We know that the cloud’s particular properties create the environment
needed for networking things together, for ensuring that networked things can
communicate with another, and for keeping networked products and equipment
available – which in turn optimizes business processes to generate new business
models. Cloud is thus the engine that drives digital transformation. And as with any
engine, it needs the right chassis to actually put its horsepower to work. Companies
now need to ask themselves how cloud technology can be integrated into their IT
strategy to turn this new potential into profit. Which cloud infrastructures and which
applications really create added value?
6.2.1 A Mere Formality
The first step is taking stock: “Is my company ‘cloud ready’?” And: “Which of my
applications, infrastructures and processes should be moved to the cloud – and
where is this less advisable at first? Is it better to manage my own cloud or have it
managed by others? If management is going to be handled in-house, do I have the
6 The Cloud in Practice 63
right numbers of properly-trained personnel to do so?” And: “What kind of costs are
we talking about here?”
Once these questions have answers, the next problem is the selection and
definition of cloud models: public, private or hybrid cloud? “Which of these is
suitable, and which data is best held in which type of cloud?” “What would be the
optimum ‘cloud mix’ for my company?” At first glance, the public cloud seems to
have a lot going for it: greater innovation, more agility. But how can businesscritical
applications and sensitive data be protected? After all, the private cloud
offers both electronic and physical layers. Or: Maybe hybrid? This alternative
combines both types of provisioning to exploit their advantages, using the public
cloud for less sensitive data or processes and reserving the private cloud for
business-critical operations. This option is increasingly popular: In 2015, Technology
Business Research forecast annual growth of 50 percent for the corporate
hybrid cloud (cf. Gaudin 2014). Yet hybrid cloud computing also means greater
complexity, of course. So how can this multi-cloud mix be managed efficiently?
Above all, it’s important for companies to work out a tailor-made strategy for the
migration to cloud infrastructure. The only cloud concept that promises long-term
success is one that has been carefully tailored to corporate goals and internal
requirements. Choosing the right partner to sound out what really is the best
cloud strategy is therefore a crucial decision. Not least because an off-the-shelf
cloud is as unlikely as the name suggests.
6.2.2 The Cloud Needs a Centralized Platform
The difficulty of full-scale in-house management, even for large corporations, is
well illustrated by the example of the hybrid cloud, where complexity is king and
scalability is everything. While working with a service provider brings obvious
benefits, what qualities should the perfect partner bring to the table? Experience,
first and foremost: Only a partner who has guided enough cloud projects of all
shapes and sizes to a successful outcome can manage the mix of public and private
with the efficiency needed, and has the relevant know-how for transitioning the
customer to the cloud in time, on budget and at the right quality. And only the early
adopters of virtualization are now able to offer the innovative, powerful data center
and network infrastructure equipped to handle the challenges of the future.
The foundation should therefore be standardized, dynamic cloud platforms that
offer variable performance profiles to ensure rapid access from anywhere on the
planet, and regardless of whether the services used are hosted by a private, public or
hybrid cloud. Platforms should also be flexible and easily scalable to ensure they
can adapt to any size of digital transformation. The advantage of such standardized,
dynamic platforms is that their cloud hosting ability isn’t limited by the constraints
of time and place but follows the principle of “any service on any server at any
time.” This means uniform access to all cloud-enabled offerings, such as platformas-
a-service (PaaS), software-as-a-service (SaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service
(IaaS). Providers, too, must pursue the right kinds of strategic partnerships, i.e.,
64 F. Strecker and J. Kellermann
the ones that enable customers to fully exploit the many advantages of a simple,
scalable and secure cloud.
Automated processes and a zero downtime architecture facilitate reliable, uninterrupted
operations even when maintenance work is required or central
components need to be updated. Under the hood, this works because the computing/
storage resources and network infrastructure are actually kept entirely separate
from the IT services and workloads, even though all of the components are
managed by a common automation framework. These interfaces are the technical
resources that make it simple to balance workloads between the physical locations
both online and offline. The customer front-end uses integrated customer self
service portals that provide automated features and applications. Acting as a hub
for public and private cloud services from arbitrary providers, they work to enable a
fully-featured service and hybrid cloud management product. This means
customers can configure, manage and pay for any of the IaaS services offered,
i.e., to suit their various needs and without having to host any of the technology
themselves.
6.2.3 A High-Availability Duo: The Twin-Core Model
The standards set for cloud infrastructure are high – and are even higher when this is
sourced from a single provider. Apart from cost effectiveness, top-priority items
include reliability, data integrity, data protection, unlimited scalability, and the
availability of data and systems. At the same time, sustainability issues are becoming
increasingly important for data centers as well, due to significant increases in
energy costs. Such cloud services must therefore be hosted by modern, efficient
data centers with failover protection. After all, cloud-served company infrastructure
and business processes only add value if the technology is guaranteed to run
smoothly. This is where a “belt-and-braces” approach proves its worth, and
“twin-core” data centers work according to this very principle. All of the data and
systems are mirrored continuously to a twin data center, where they remain
available even if one of these “twins” suffers faults and outages – due to extreme
weather conditions or flooding, for example. Germany’s largest data center in
Biere, Saxony-Anhalt forms just such a twin-core with the data center in
Magdeburg. Thanks to this arrangement, the 40,000 square meters of data center
space (once fully complete) will offer availability of up to 99.999 percent, which
translates into a maximum downtime of around five minutes for a whole year.
Comprehensive security models, which include the deployment of IT security
technology as well as numerous physical security precautions – such as access
control points and surveillance systems – also keep unauthorized individuals far
away from corporate data and infrastructure. The architecture of such a modern data
center is also able to meet increasingly stringent requirements concerning energy
costs: Paired with high-density deployment of installed IT systems, the TwinCore
concept cuts operating costs and CO2 emissions alike. Although the data centers
need less space and fewer servers, they simultaneously keep IT performance high
6 The Cloud in Practice 65
thanks to the deployment of standardized cloud platforms – which in turn cuts the
costs of cloud hosting for the customer.
6.2.4 All a Question of Standards
To better understand guarantees made for high availability, we should first make it
clear that systems kept available virtually around the clock are not necessarily the
go-to standard. For data centers, a set of quality levels is used, as defined by the
“tier” standard. This ranges from Tier 1 (low level of failover protection) to Tier
4 (maximum failover protection).
With a private cloud, data is not transmitted over the Internet but over a secure
network and is hosted by high-efficiency data centers whose location is actually
known – in contrast to public cloud products – and which can prove to be very
useful when dealing with data protection law. Suitable data centers include those
whose levels of annual availability meet the Tier 3 (99.98 percent) or Tier 4 (high
availability, >99.999 percent) data center standards. Such data centers are designed
from the ground up for the hosting of mission-critical business applications and the
storage of sensitive data. The same levels also apply for hybrid clouds. Public
clouds are typically hosted by Tier 2 or 3 data centers, however. Tier 2 offers only
simple redundancy, and access is not usually handled over a dedicated, secure
network but is run over the Internet, as mentioned at the outset. After registering
with the cloud provider, users have immediate “one-click” access to the services.
Since the provider doesn’t usually include individual customer support in the
package, however, this variant is typically used for test systems rather than complex
systems – and is certainly never deployed for business-critical corporate
infrastructure.
6.2.5 “Universal” IT Security Needs a Strategy
The fact that tier standards and strategies for high availability are hugely relevant –
and in fact essential for ensuring a company’s ability to do business – is underlined
by the major challenges facing IT and the people who work in the field. Hundreds of
thousands of new viruses, worms and trojans appear each and every day. Experts
from T-Systems’ Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) also report that
attackers are becoming more professional and using increasingly sophisticated
methods. Modern data espionage is typically motivated by financial interests. For
this reason if no other, the threat is more real and more serious than ever, and it
means that cyber security services form an integral element of trust in a networked
world. Whether in the in-house data center or in the cloud operated by a service
provider: Without needs-based, end-to-end security, companies will rapidly face
problems of an existential nature.
To date, however, the security architecture of many companies has resembled a
medieval city wall: a hard shell, but a soft underbelly. Perimeter security is used to
66 F. Strecker and J. Kellermann
corral individual IT systems, while entrances and exits are more or less wellprotected.
Keeping things secure while achieving increased digitalization requires
more intelligent and comprehensive models, however, embedded in overall corporate
strategy, as well as the continuous development and refinement of these
models. Companies need to transform their IT so that they can enjoy demanddriven
utilization of cloud-based resources (for example) without compromising
corporate security. Corporate Governance and Corporate Risk Management must
both be involved here. In addition, the topic of data protection must also be given
top priority: Germany has a clear geopolitical advantage here that companies
should make the most of. Not least because the Federal Data Protection Act is
one of the toughest laws governing informational self-determination, and the use of
personal data requires either an explicit legal justification or the consent of the
person affected.
Accordingly, data integrity and data protection aren’t simply checklist items to
be worked through: Corporate security requires a high-quality strategy and this, in
turn, requires a tailor-made security assessment (see Advanced Cyber Defense, for
example). This not only provides a set of results that can be used to derive a
workable security strategy but also yields reports about security incidents that
must be dealt with in accordance with the corporate security strategy. Specialists
and specialized units who focus solely on security work can also help to raise
awareness of attack vectors and scenarios, and ensure that potential hazards specific
to certain solutions can be identified at an early enough stage.
6.2.6 The IT Quality Factor, or the Pipe Dream of Perfect IT
Even if the technologies themselves meet the highest standards, companies still
need to be clear about one thing: There’s no such thing as perfect IT. Not in the real
world, anyway. Wherever IT is used, there is always the possibility that a system
outage will occur. And there are plenty of reasons: a technical defect in installed
components, breakdowns caused by natural disasters or bad weather, or simple
human error. Nor is it simply enough to use technology as a precaution against
potential outages – with high-availability, redundant infrastructure models, for
example. Facilities also need to be in place for resolving faults rapidly and
systematically in cases when a system decides to go off the rails. Downtime is
expensive, after all: as much as 5,600 US dollars a minute according to some
accounts (cf. Lerner 2014). This is an area where programs for securing IT quality,
whose strategies span all levels of the company, are becoming more popular. One
example would be appropriate change and incident management plus clearly
defined, well-established processes that are regularly audited and measured in
KPIs. Not least because IT availability isn’t just a question of quality in a technological
sense: It is also a question of quality for the organization itself and the staff
who works there (“processes, people and platforms”). And this high standard of
quality must also be valid for the cloud provider’s partners. Only with appropriate
supplier certification can customers benefit from true, end-to-end IT availability,
6 The Cloud in Practice 67
which not only keeps the risk of faults to a minimum in the first place – by the use of
appropriate preventive measures – but also guarantees the fastest possible resolution
of such faults by using a set of clearly defined and contractually agreed
processes.
6.2.7 Greater Efficiency Under the Hood
Companies benefit from the availability of shared resource usage in the cloud and
the fact that these services are provided dynamically according to demand. This
enables the implementation of flexible business models that themselves facilitate
the accelerated roll-out of scalable services, independently of both geographical
location and company size. Any company’s decision to adopt a cloud solution is
also materially influenced by the factor of cost optimization, however. Accordingly,
it is important that every process runs with maximum efficiency under the hood.
Five levers, whose effects mesh together like gearwheels, are crucial here:
standardized services, consolidated systems, automated production, global supply
capability and optimized capacity utilization. With in-house solutions in particular,
it is often difficult to standardize across a complete portfolio of products. Yet this is
precisely where working with a service provider brings further advantages – always
assuming full use of the latter’s options in the service of the customer. For the
greater the degree of standardization in a provider data center, the larger the
ultimate benefit for companies, even at later stages. If standards are implemented,
consolidation onto just a few systems is possible. This, in turn, sets the stage for
optimum automation, since automating a handful of large systems rather than many
small ones is considerably more straightforward. In large environments, many
thousands of systems can be consolidated and automated simultaneously. This
not only saves physical space but ensures better capacity utilization, just as with
global services and support structures, since they are uniform the world over and
not tied to any one location. Infrastructure utilization can therefore be optimized
and loads can be distributed dynamically. This, in turn, initiates a positive chain
reaction: The costs for factory downtime are minimized, which results in lower unit
costs, which in turn generates more favorable conditions for the customer.
In this context, economies of scale have a decisive role to play, since comparable
unit costs are effectively out of reach for in-house operations. After all, few
companies are capable of operating the perfect combination of standardized technology
and the necessary degree of process automation entirely in-house at a level
of efficiency that can also match the data center’s benefits of scale in terms of
energy procurement. Such benefits only materialize following consistent implementation
of the underlying models, paired with a large customer base. Closemeshed
monitoring is also important: Only continuous measurement of the results
by means of KPIs (utilization, costs, etc.) creates a basis for their further optimization.
Ultimately, broad-based efficiency is therefore the essential foundation for a
cost-optimized cloud. Even then, its tremendous economic potential has still to be
68 F. Strecker and J. Kellermann
fully exploited: As stated at the outset, the cloud-accelerated economy has yet to
reach its top speed.
6.2.8 Outlook: The Software Defined Data Center
The logical next step in efficiency is to virtualize the infrastructure in its entirety,
and here we are seeing a new trend with a bright future: the Software Defined Data
Center (SDDC). Constant growth in data volumes, combined with the routine
appearance of new requirements such as realtime reporting on information, is
placing greater and greater demands on IT infrastructure. According to one report,
the global market for SDDC is set to reach a staggering 77.2 billion US dollars by
2020 – equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 28.8 percent (cf. Markets and
Markets 2015). In Europe, the annual growth rate forecast is as high as 40 percent.
So what does SDDC bring to the table? SDDC offers a centralized point of control
for reducing IT infrastructure complexity and simplifying its management. Hardware
such as storage, CPUs, firewalls, routers and switches is virtualized and can be
configured in the SDDC model without physical access to infrastructure
components. The end result is a fully “elastic,” demand-driven allocation of
resources that is both automated and scalable. In a nutshell, this means CIOs
effectively get a wall socket for the application, which then simply needs to be
integrated into their business processes. Operational processes are handled by the
provider, who moves the application workload between the private and public cloud
as needed – and naturally not before implementing appropriate levels of encryption
to fulfill data protection requirements.
6.2.9 Conclusion
There’s no such thing as “the” cloud. Just as each company is different, so too are
the individual requirements for corporate IT and hence cloud services. These
services are provided by a number of cloud models, however. It is important that
businesses choose a strategy that works for them and sign up for a cloud service that
offers enough flexibility to adjust this strategy to meet new requirements whenever
this may become necessary. Flexibility is, after all, the key benefit of the cloud.
Always assuming that the infrastructure is operated by a service provider who can
offer the necessary platforms and platform strategies. Efficient, reliable and costeffective
cloud operations require more than just a few server racks in the in-house
data center: They require experience, technology and quality. Ideally, the data
center will also be located in Germany to ensure adequate provisions for data
protection are made based on the Federal Data Protection Act. This overall package
is also essential if the cloud is to make good on its promise of equipping companies
to face the future. Technical specifications are one thing, but innovation depends on
much more than a virtualized environment.

No Innovation Without Quality 7
Anne Teague
Like many food and drink companies, Heineken’s top IT priority is to tackle big
data. It will form the foundation for all of our digital innovation and support our
strategy of developing a deeper understanding of the customer. Heineken is a
consumer brand, but its activities are predominantly selling business-to-business,
so we have typically been one step removed from the consumer. As a result, it has
been difficult to truly understand how, when and where our beers are drunk. But
now that is changing.
There is a huge – potentially overwhelming – amount of data becoming available.
That data flows at great speed, from a huge variety of sources, in many
different formats. Our ability to innovate will depend on how quickly we can
analyze this data and convert it into actionable business intelligence. Throughout
the process, we must ensure that the data is secure and privacy is protected. If we
can do all of this successfully, we’ll be able to improve the customer experience and
the products, and reduce our environmental footprint too.
7.1 Social Media Drives Data Growth
One reason for the growth in data is social media, a powerful tool for brands to
connect directly with their consumers, bypassing the supply chain. Heineken’s
brand Don Equis was the first to achieve a million Facebook fans and now has
2.9 million. That’s just one of more than 250 brands we own that are growing their
fan bases. Outside of these direct relationships, we also need to be able to listen to
what people are saying about our brand online. A reputation is won over years but
can be lost in hours. Complaints can quickly go viral, sometimes based on erroneous
information, and we have learned it is important to be able to identify and
correct any misunderstandings promptly.

73
7.2 Gathering Data from the Internet of Things
Another driver for the growth in data is the Internet of Things. According to analyst
house Gartner (2014), there will be 25 billion devices connected to the Internet by
2020. Deployment is still in the early stages in the food and drink sector, but
connected devices have the potential to improve both the customer experience
and the quality of information available to the manufacturer. For example, smart
kegs could be used to monitor the freshness of beer in bars, ensuring a premium
experience for customers and also providing the manufacturer with information on
consumption. In retail outlets, fridges could recognize customers and offer relevant
manufacturer promotions to them when they’re selecting their drinks.
Devices in the home could also be connected. The Heineken Sub is a home
draught beer machine available in France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. In the
future, phone apps linked to the Sub could be used to show customers when they
need to reorder and deliver relevant promotions to them too.
7.3 Realizing the Value of Big Data
As more and more devices become connected, we’ll be able to gather data from
production to consumption: Learning more about our manufacturing and transportation
processes, and how our products are bought and enjoyed. We’ve already
begun to fill the big data pool, but this information will become most valuable when
we are able to mix data from multiple sources, analyze it and spot previously
unknown correlations and relationships. This capability will be fundamental for
enabling digital innovation and realizing value from it.
7.4 The Constraints on Digital Innovation
All too often, digital innovation is not empowered but constrained by the IT
systems an organization has. Large companies typically have a patchwork of legacy
systems built up over decades and through acquisitions, making the IT inflexible
and hard to manage. In many cases, it is ill-suited to the big data world where
information needs to be able to flow freely between applications and be analyzed in
multiple contexts.
Integrating and launching a new application could take 18–24 months. It’s hard
to reconcile that with the need to be an agile organization responding to market
opportunities quickly. At Heineken, for example, we have projects that we know
about a long time in advance (such as our sponsorship of the Champions League
and the James Bond films), but our local marketing teams also need to respond to
opportunities that arise in their markets at short notice. The entire lifecycle for a
new digital product might be just three months, from inception to retirement. IT
organizations must reinvent themselves so they can deliver digital innovation in
those timeframes.
74 A. Teague
7.5 Reinventing the IT Function
To achieve this transformation, there needs to be a shift in the IT team’s mind-set. If
the team is spending most of its time managing the plumbing of the IT (as many do),
then there is little time left to support the business with these new applications. The
goal should be to establish a high-quality system that requires minimal day-to-day
intervention from the in-house team, so that they are free to work creatively with the
rest of the business. By definition, innovation is about doing something for the first
time. It’s risky for the business owners, so it’s essential that they feel they can
depend on the IT team to support them. This is especially important in a federated
organization such as ours, where the centralized global IT function must win the
trust of the operating companies worldwide and be seen as the best partner for
delivering innovation. If the IT team is tied up in maintenance, it will be hard for
them to give the business users the time and attention they deserve.
Heineken outsources the management of most of its infrastructure to T-Systems
Dynamic Services, which takes care of hosting, operations, technical application
management, maintenance, administration and security. Because T-Systems
manages the operational infrastructure layer, the global IT team at Heineken is
able to focus on more strategic initiatives in partnership with the business.
It won’t be easy for the IT team to pivot from plumbing to innovation. The
technological change and outsourcing process take some time, and it is important
not to underestimate the cultural change required too. Some IT team members
might initially feel that their job is threatened when external partners are brought in,
or feel that their authority is being eroded within the business. Clear communication
and training will be essential to ensure that the team first of all understands and then
benefits from the opportunities for job enrichment that this adjustment brings.
7.6 Defining the High-Quality IT System
The first step in enabling a more agile IT function is to establish a high-quality IT
system that it, and the entire business, can depend upon.
Quality is a slippery concept to define, and in the past metrics such as uptime
have often been used as proxies. End users have become increasingly demanding of
the IT that they use at work. At home they use web services (such as Gmail or
Facebook) and desktop email software. Downtime for these is practically zero.
When people get to the office, they expect that same smooth experience and want to
trust that the IT will always be available so they can focus on doing great work.
Downtime is a blunt instrument for measuring user satisfaction, though, which is
the real end goal.
At Heineken, we have abandoned key performance indicators in favor of a focus
on the end user experience. In our view, a high-quality IT system is one that makes
users happy, which means enabling them to do their job effectively, both day-to-day
and when launching entrepreneurial projects. That requires reliability, of course,
7 No Innovation Without Quality 75
but scalability and agility are equally important, and flexibility is also key. These
are the characteristics that define a high-quality IT system in the eyes of the users.
There are three facets to a high-quality IT system: the platform, the people, and
the processes. All of these must be optimized to satisfy the end user’s needs.
7.7 The Platform
When I assumed the CIO position in 2012, one of my top concerns was to
consolidate our IT environment and make it more manageable, so we could more
easily respond to the business requirements. While we still have a significant estate
of legacy IT, we are aiming to move as much of our IT as possible into the cloud,
and this is where our new investments are focused. As well as reliability and built-in
redundancy, the cloud offers us scalability. This will become increasingly important
as we embark on big data projects.
We are committed to the concept of software-as-a-service. When we chose
Office365, for example, we did so knowing that the vendor would update it and
add new functionality over time without us needing to worry about it. This is a painfree
way for us to keep our systems current, without distracting the IT team from
more strategic ventures.
The cloud also satisfies our requirements for a more agile IT function, making it
easy to spin up new services and applications. We can ramp up resources at short
notice too, so it’s easier to support digital campaigns with uneven or unpredictable
demand, or to respond to any other business change quickly.
There is a built-in benefit to the cloud’s pricing model too in that it encourages
the right behavior from business functions. Under an “all you can eat” pricing
model, there is no incentive to innovate in the IT, rationalize it or even retire
applications effectively at the end of their life. With a focus on launching new
applications, it’s easy for this to be overlooked and for redundant applications to
accumulate. This is especially true as the lifecycle of digital products increases, and
we see more and more short-term and local campaigns launching across our
territories.
With a pay-as-you-go model, or in the Heineken world “pay per drink,” the
business pays less if it uses less resources. This approach rewards the right behavior
and helps to ensure that resources are not being wasted. We have ambitious targets
to reduce our carbon emissions, and effective use of IT can make a contribution
towards that. Without this incentive, users are likely to be more risk-averse and less
innovative. The risk of downtime is a given in any IT project, so business leaders
are unlikely to take it on if there’s no possible reward.
The cloud is enabling us to move towards the dynamic workplace too. People are
passionate about the devices they use at home, including phones and tablets that
provide instant information through an intuitive and enjoyable user interface. At
work, they increasingly expect to use similar technology. The idea that you would
have to go to a specific desk or device to find some information seems antiquated.
People want to be able to access corporate systems in the same way they access
76 A. Teague
their personal email and social networking applications: anywhere, any time and
using whichever device they have available. From a business perspective, this
capability is essential for agility and competitiveness.
One way to achieve user satisfaction is to allow them to use the devices they are
most comfortable with, so we are now exploring bring-your-own-device (BYOD)
and bring-your-own-mobile (BYOM) strategies. There are many challenges
associated with these strategies, including how you reconcile staff freedom with
company expectations. Heineken is a premium brand, so it might create the wrong
impression for a sales rep to make a customer visit with a beaten-up old laptop, for
example. From an IT delivery point of view, though, it shouldn’t matter whether the
user prefers Android, Apple or Windows: Our goal is to accommodate whatever
makes the user happy.
As a step towards enabling the dynamic workplace and BYOD, we have
implemented two programs called HeiHosting, which consolidated our SAP
instances and non-SAP software, and rationalized our server landscape. This was
an important first step because if your software and server landscape is localized, it
is difficult to be agile and provide consistent remote access to applications.
Simplifying the IT environment was the most important project in our
strategic plan.
We consider standardization to be essential for a high-quality IT platform. We
want to empower business users to use off-the-shelf solutions from marquee
partners, without customization, so we can deploy more quickly and at lower
cost. Customization carries risks and implies a need to retain specialist knowledge
on how a system has been modified. It also takes time that would be better invested
in more strategic initiatives, both on the IT and business side of the project. We rely
on T-Systems’ roadmap and offering so we don’t have to reinvent the wheel, and so
we can free up time and budget for innovation.
One of our guiding principles for the platform is that we don’t want to be the first
to deploy a new technology. That might seem to stifle innovation, but in fact the
opposite is true. For us to be innovative, we need to be agile, need to have systems
that users willingly adopt, and need to have a strong relationship between the
business users and the IT team. All of these could be threatened by deploying an
unproven technology that resulted in downtime or other failures.
7.8 The People
Having the right platform is only part of the puzzle: Its success depends on the
people who are responsible for it. We can take it as a given that the people have the
necessary expertise and experience required, so what defines the quality of the
people is how well they are able to work together and communicate, especially
between the customer and provider organization in an outsourcing arrangement.
Internally, the IT team has an important role in coordinating the ecosystem of
partners and ensuring they satisfy the business requirements. Outsourcing doesn’t
mean that the IT team can sit back and not do anything. Externally, outsourced
7 No Innovation Without Quality 77
partners should take responsibility for delivering the day-to-day IT quality, and for
helping to evolve the platform.
To get the best out of an outsourced partner, it is important to focus on the longterm
relationship. At Heineken, we are not interested in enforcing penalties when
service level agreements aren’t met. This might sound unusual, given that the
outsourcing industry has historically relied on penalties to govern providers. We
strongly believe, though, that it is short-term thinking to see a mistake and then seek
punishment and compensation for it, rather than working cooperatively on a
solution. Penalties don’t fix the underlying technical problem and don’t reassure
the business that the issue is under control either. At a time when the customer and
provider should be working more closely together because a problem has come to
light, penalties drive a wedge between them, demotivating those who are most
influential on the success of our IT. When entering into an outsourcing relationship,
it’s healthier to think of it like a marriage, where mistakes are forgiven, and
each party supports the other in the long term.
That’s not to say that the outsourcing company has an easy time. Its people need
to develop their role beyond keeping the systems running and hoping the customer
doesn’t bug them. At Heineken, we are a beer company and not an IT company. We
turn to our ecosystem of providers for advice, and expect companies such as
T-Systems to proactively identify opportunities to increase standardization and
introduce new technologies that will better support our requirements. In the way
that the internal IT team must focus on innovation and become a trusted advisor to
the business, outsourcing providers must be willing to support our entrepreneurial
projects and become trusted advisors to the IT team.
This is only possible if there is honest and open communication on both sides,
based on a deep understanding of each other’s businesses. That means discussing
not just the opportunities but also the difficulties. In an environment reliant on
penalties, this kind of communication can be suffocated by the fear that it would
call attention to weaknesses. In a long-term relationship, discussions like these can
only strengthen the partnership and the IT systems by providing a foundation for
robust long-term planning.
This kind of relationship requires a complete change in skill set. The internal IT
team needs to work with outsourcing providers as partners and colleagues, and not
as suppliers. This is much more challenging than just checking whether the IT is
working, and working out which penalties apply if not. The external team needs to
go beyond the technical skills required to manage today’s IT systems and become
more strategic, aligning with the customer’s long-term goals and proactively
helping to evolve the system towards them.
On both sides, there needs to be an unprecedented level of trust. For those who
have previously worked under a penalties-led framework, it will take considerable
effort to become less defensive and more open. Many roles will be transformed
from operational and responsive, to strategic and proactive. It is still rare to find
people who have the complete skill set required, so it is essential that customer and
provider businesses both help their staff to broaden their talents.
78 A. Teague
There might be resistance to this change internally from those who would rather
focus on IT plumbing than more strategic work. At Heineken and T-Systems, our
communications teams have joined forces to help explain to the Heineken operating
companies what the changes are and how they will be affected. Clear
communications within the companies can make a big difference in helping everybody
to see the opportunities that a closer partnership will bring.
7.9 The Processes
The customer and outsourced provider need to work together to plan which
processes should be implemented. As a first step, there needs to be a business-IT
alignment process to ensure that the technology is meeting the needs of the business
owners. This ensures that the outsourcing provider offers the right solutions, and
can also identify any gaps in requirements. T-Systems explains its roadmap to us,
and if there is something we need that they cannot offer, we are able to work
together to find other providers that can plug the gap.
It is important that the customer organization has a clear vision of the desired
architecture to ensure that any changes to the systems are consistent with what the
customer wants its IT to ultimately look like. Without a vision, the risk is that the
architecture could gradually evolve in a direction that the customer would not
ideally have chosen.
Service level agreements remain useful for managing expectations on both sides,
but it’s important to think of what you want the relationship to achieve, and find
effective ways to track progress towards that. In our relationship with T-Systems,
we measure the level of standardization and server consolidation and have an index
for cost reduction. These reflect the strategic imperatives in the relationship, and
show how quickly we are moving towards a platform that will better support agile
innovation.
We also aim for Zero Outage in our partnership with T-Systems, which is a
requirement to satisfy end users and ensure that our business can operate uninterrupted.
Heineken is increasingly dependent on automation supported by IT for our
production processes, so downtime can have a significant effect on our business –
and it’s impossible to recapture the time lost if a production line is stopped. If a
brewery can’t brew any beer for a day, it would be a disaster.
T-Systems has processes to achieve zero outage that span operations for day-today
availability, and projects, which is when the greatest risk of downtime occurs.
Major incidents are prevented using effective project planning, employee certification,
regular system monitoring and end-to-end business service monitoring. The
processes increase the availability of Heineken’s network and monitor any risks in
the operating environment. The effectiveness of these processes is measured using
the TRI*M index, which stands for the three Ms: measuring, monitoring and
managing. To track its progress, T-Systems commissions market research firm
TNS Infratest to ask customers how T-Systems scores in these areas. Over the last
7 No Innovation Without Quality 79
three years, T-Systems has been able to raise Heineken’s rating from 40 to 110 as a
result of focusing on high-quality platforms, processes and, especially, people.
It is also important to introduce processes that enable partners in the outsourced
ecosystem to speak to each other. Instead of being the middleman in the process, the
customer organization should empower its partners to cooperate with each other in
the best interests of the customer and the outsourced providers.
In our case, T-Systems works closely with other ecosystem partners, speaking
weekly and meeting monthly, to discuss how they can jointly prepare to meet
Heineken’s requirements. Top of the agenda are innovation and rationalizing the
app landscape. If there are operational problems, these companies can work
together to resolve them without necessarily needing to involve Heineken in that
process. While our IT team will sometimes need to contribute our company
perspective, if they can be excluded from more routine inquiries that further
liberates them to work on digital innovation with end users. High-quality processes
should, as far as possible, enable the IT systems to be managed independently of the
in-house IT team.
This is only possible when everyone enters into the relationship in the spirit of
partnership, and when the processes help to reinforce that. The customer needs to
trust that its providers will work in its best interests. The ecosystem partners will
sometimes be in competition with each other and need to communicate openly
about that and turn to the customer for a judgement on how best to handle that.
Everybody needs to be confident that they will be supported by their colleagues in
other organizations, and that if something does go wrong, they will work together to
resolve it.
To ensure the organizations remain aligned, there is also a continuous dialogue
between the top managers at Heineken and T-Systems. A strong relationship can
only be built on trust, with both parties sharing their goals, upcoming innovations,
and aspirations for the partnership.
7.10 Conclusion
New technologies, including big data and the Internet of Things, bring huge
opportunities to companies that want to better understand their customers and
find new ways to delight them. In order to take advantage of these opportunities,
there needs to be a high-quality IT system that offers not only reliability, but also
agility, scalability and flexibility. The right platform is the basis for a high-quality
IT system, but it must be supported by the right people and the right processes. In
particular, the IT teams need to develop a more strategic outlook that enables them
to support the business requirements for innovation, and there needs to be a trusting
relationship between companies and their outsourced partners. This provides a
stable basis for day-to-day and strategic management of the IT systems, and a
springboard for agile innovation. There can be no digital innovation without a highquality
IT system to enable it.

The Counterculture of Silicon Valley 8
Steffan Heuer
It only takes a few weeks in Silicon Valley to gather ideas and establish long-lasting
relationships – with some well-calculated culture shock included. But what exactly
do German executives take home with them after visiting this epicenter of global
innovation?
Thomas Neubert can open the doors to big companies or small startups in Silicon
Valley – but regardless of which it is, his visitors from Germany usually have three
goals: to get inspiration, sound out partnerships and maybe even lay the groundwork
for investments. Neubert has been head of the Business Development and
Partnering Group for Deutsche Telekom in Mountain View since 2012, and after
spending a total of 25 years in the region, he knows this high-tech stronghold better
than anyone. This benefits his guests, for whom Neubert regularly organizes what
are usually week-long “innovation expeditions” in the Valley.
A week sounds like a short time, but these expeditions are preceded by months of
preparation which involve identifying “the most important key players, venture
capitalists and exciting startups in each technology or sector.” If nothing else, this
helps channel his visitors’ curiosity and interests so that Neubert’s European
colleagues and American partners get the maximum benefit from such short
trips – by jointly spotting upcoming trends early on, testing their potential market
rollout in Europe and entering into partnerships and investments that pay off for
both sides.
Take Deutsche Telekom, for example: By the summer of 2015, around
80 visitors had experienced this intensive exposure to California’s high-tech
center – everyone from board of management members to the marketing heads of
all of Deutsche Telekom’s European affiliates. “We’ve established a credible
presence in the Valley which makes it possible for us to spot trends and ideas
over here and, conversely, to share our own ideas,” Neubert says. “This exchange

Professionals, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-31824-0_8
83
regularly gives rise to partnerships for the European market which are very valuable
to any startup from the Valley wanting to grow quickly.”
8.1 Endless Tech Boom
Deutsche Telekom is not alone in its desire for fast, dynamic access to the epicenter
of the networked world. European entrepreneurs and managers have long been
drawn to the West Coast. Spurred on by the relentless tech boom, more and more
German companies are dispatching employees to the region between San Jose and
San Francisco.
They often spend just a few weeks or months in northern California, but there is
a definite trend towards staying longer – sometimes for several years – so they can
scout for trends permanently instead of just intermittently, get closer to the deal
flow of local venture capitalists and generally be inspired by the faster, more open
culture of the whole Bay Area. In extreme cases, some German entrepreneurs are
spending more time in California than at their headquarters in Europe, because after
a few years of continual expedition trips they have realized that their international
customers and their Californian partners and investors want them to be more
present – and their expanded presence in Silicon Valley is a good selling point
back in the Old World.
Technical innovation happens outside of Silicon Valley too, of course, but
hardly any other region has produced as many success stories since the 1950s.
Semiconductor production was followed by the computer industry and then – since
the triumphal march of the web – by the Internet economy that has grown up around
applications for connected living and the Internet of Things. “The Valley” first gave
birth to Intel, Cisco and Apple, and later to the new generation of globally
successfully companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter.
8.2 Magnet for Capital and Creativity
The statistics paint a clear picture. The flood of innovations shows no sign of letting
up because local startups are continually the source of important (and sometimes
controversial) sparks for the digital transformation of every sector of industry. In
2014 alone, 25.3 billion dollars of venture capital flowed into the region, which now
has a good three million inhabitants. “In Silicon Valley, the idea gets financed, not
the success,” wrote Ulrich Grillo, President of the Federation of German Industries
(BDI), in the Handelsblatt newspaper, pointing out what is perhaps one of the most
important cultural differences. In terms of economic power, American startups pull
in seven times as much risk capital as their German counterparts. The German
startup world is lagging behind especially as regards financing opportunities, says
Grillo. The large number of startups contributed significantly to the fact that, in the
past year, nearly one out of every ten companies that went public in the USA was
from Silicon Valley.
84 S. Heuer
It is no wonder that German companies want to keep a closer eye on this creative
activity which is attracting smart people from all over the world. Neubert’s team at
Deutsche Telekom therefore evaluates dozens of startups working in areas such as
big data, the Internet of Things, the connected home, wearables and consumer
services. The “expeditions” then pack in four or more meetings every day, where
large companies such as Cisco or Apple outline their vision for the networked
future and startups present solutions which are sometimes only half-formed. “These
visits always have a clearly defined agenda,” Neubert says, “if for no other reason
than to avoid ‘scattergun’ innovation tourism.” Above all, many of these meetings
offer an opportunity to discuss new ideas or potentially profitable areas of business
much more openly than is usually the case in meetings or sales pitches for the
purposes of customer relationship management.
8.3 Two-Pagers Instead of Hundred-Page Contracts
Other German companies are taking an equally targeted approach. Stefanie Kemp,
head of IT Governance at RWE and a member of the RWE Innovation Hub
leadership team, has been traveling back and forth to Silicon Valley for a decade
“to see where we can reasonably introduce innovations into our business segments
which are stable and have growth potential.” Major trends such as digital transformation,
Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things play an especially important role for
Kemp. For a company like RWE, these trends are reflected in activities such as
decentralized energy management and solutions for smart and connected living.
Kemp mentions Enlighted as an example of a startup whose ideas have effectively
“electrified” her company. This spinoff from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) specializes in sensor-controlled room lighting which responds
to human movements. C3 Energy, another example, develops smart grid applications
and views energy supply as an aspect of the sharing economy. Among other
things, this entails flexible and intelligent billing and management platforms which
could make it possible for potentially millions of households with solar collectors to
share charging stations for powering electric cars, for instance. “Every day the
Valley produces new solutions, products and innovations, and contracts are signed
for them immediately. It all happens not with patent applications or hundred-page
agreements, but on the basis of two-pagers, here and now – it definitely has its
own culture,” Kemp says.
8.4 Less Complexity – More Risk
It is in this sense, above all, that RWE managers take away a better understanding of
innovation culture from their visits. Kemp is always asking the same question:
“How does Silicon Valley, as its own community, manage to keep the innovation
cycle going?” Sometimes it has been “simple realizations that we’ve taken home
with us: We’re also working to change our corporate culture. It comes down to
8 The Counterculture of Silicon Valley 85
reducing complexity and establishing a new culture of error and risk. We want to
embrace the idea that failure can also be a success as long as you learn from it.”
In order to become part of the ecosystem in California and connect with potential
partners more quickly, RWE has had a five-member team on the ground since
March 2015.
The energy company E.ON has similar plans for Silicon Valley. “Nowhere else
in the world has the same confluence of creativity, capital and entrepreneurship. It’s
is a unique breeding ground for innovation and speed, and it’s what makes the place
such an effective incubator for ideas,” says E.ON CIO Edgar Aschenbrenner. The
E.ON group is pursuing three specific overriding goals in Silicon Valley: “First, we
visit companies that we believe can contribute to the further development and
implementation of our digitalization strategy. Second, we gather cultural food for
thought, such as how to use social media to make the hierarchies and structures in
the company more permeable to ideas.” For example, E.ON now has an “Executive
Hub,” which is like an internal Facebook for the board of management and top-level
managers. And third, E.ON picks up ideas in California for how it can offer new,
web-based services to customers. “We look to see how you build something like
that architecturally, keep it simple to use and underpin it with a robust IT security
and data protection concept. Then we implement it at home with our own IT
partners,” Aschenbrenner says. One concrete result of this was the creation of a
Big Data Lab by the Technology & Innovation unit at E.ON which can predict the
failure of assets in order to initiate proactive maintenance, for example, or can
analyze consumption figures for business customers in order to develop savings
ideas and efficiency measures. “The lab employees have gone off the beaten path
and can now deliver results within just a few days, or even hours,” says Susana
Quintana-Plaza, Senior Vice President Technology & Innovation at E.ON.
In the summer of 2014, E.ON Technology & Innovation also set up a
branch office in San Francisco which acts as a “permanent bridgehead” to new
technologies, processes, issues and companies. The office is run by Konrad Augustin,
who is responsible for strategic co-investments. Prior to this, the company spent
two years sending employees from its Venture Team to Silicon Valley every
six months and putting them up in the office of a local venture capital partner.
8.5 Tangible Results and a Dose of Euphoria
“How long you stay depends on what you’re trying to do,” Augustin says regarding
the optimal timing. “If it’s more about business, then its good to spend a few days or
weeks gathering impressions and experiencing the different way of thinking and the
willingness to take risks. But if it’s about investment, you need more time to form
networks and cultivate dialogue.” Augustin describes his job as “market development,”
which involves contacting young companies who have moved beyond the
concept-testing phase as well as venture capitalists. “Scouting is important, but it’s
always just the first step.” By mid-2015, E.ON had invested in seven startups from
86 S. Heuer
Silicon Valley (out of a total of 12 in the USA and Europe) whose solutions take
account of the coming changes in the energy market.
But in Edgar Aschenbrenner’s experience, it’s important to not “just look at
startups. We naturally go to Cisco and Intel, too, to find out what the nextgeneration
chip will look like and where computers are headed. When you see
how much money and manpower these companies are investing in research and
development, you realize immediately that they’re the powerhouses.”
It is no accident that Silicon Valley offers such an unbelievably dynamic – and,
in the eyes of foreign visitors and businesspeople – very attractive mixture of large
companies with a global presence and a vast ecosystem of small startups working in
nearly every imaginable niche. In fact, it is the product of a historical development
that can be traced back to before the birth of Moore’s Law. Just as a reminder: In a
short essay written for Electronics Magazine in 1965, Intel co-founder Gordon
Moore said that the complexity (and thus the power) of computer chips doubled
every 12 months. Ten years later he revised his prediction of exponential growth to
24 months, and this cycle remains the driving force behind innovation in the Valley
to this day. Technology consultant Rob Enderle calls Moore’s Law the “heartbeat”
of the region. “It has driven the Valley forward at an unprecedented pace and
secured its leading global position,” Enderle says.
Historian Leslie Berlin, who maintains the Silicon Valley Archives at Stanford
University, thinks a total of three forces have turned the region into a Mecca for
foreign businesspeople, engineers and programmers: technology, culture and capital.
She says transistors were the grain of sand around which the pearl of Silicon
Valley formed and continues to grow – from the first semiconductors, to the cloud
and mobile apps.
Equally important is the unique culture of the Valley, which has been transformed
from an agricultural region with fruit orchards into a community of inquisitive
minds and inventors. The ongoing population boom has also ensured a regular
inflow of fresh blood and fresh ideas which the long-term visitors from Germany
can discuss and vie for with US citizens, other Europeans, Chinese or Indians. The
population of the Valley tripled to one million between 1950 and 1970. In purely
mathematical terms, according to Berlin, this equates to one new resident every
15 minutes over the course of 20 years. Today, one out of every three inhabitants of
the region comes from outside the USA, and among college graduates the number
of foreigners rises to more than 60 percent.
One thing is certain: Anyone who comes here and stays must be open to the
Valley’s unfamiliar structures and its (often equally unfamiliar) straightforward
conversational style, which differs from traditional European norms and even from
the standards of the East Coast of America. Ultimately, this nearly institutionalized
love of experimentation attracts a particular class of managers and makers who are
willing to accept that the Valley is different. And this difference is based, to a
certain extent, on the “counterculture” of San Francisco, which has – at least in
part – influenced the thinking of the local technological elite.
8 The Counterculture of Silicon Valley 87
The third important element that makes the Valley such a huge magnet for
European businesspeople and inventors is its network of large, institutional and
small investors who are willing to bank on “the next big thing” even if it falls
outside of the Valley’s traditional core competencies of pure hardware and software.
The best example of this is the rise of highly disruptive startups such as Uber
or Airbnb, each of which, in its own way, has rocked or even permanently taken
down an established industry, such as transportation or accommodation. Incidentally,
another of the Valley’s draws is its average annual income of 116,000 US
dollars which is nearly twice the national average.
As many members of the “innovation expeditions” find out first hand, such
“disruptions” usually only come about because established entrepreneurs or venture
capitalists have created and continuously nurtured close-knit networks of young
founders so that they can identify trends early on and invest in them. California
labor law – which makes it possible to switch from one company to another without
penalty, sometimes in the space of a day – also encourages this continual process of
renewal, through which ideas and/or their originators are chosen on the basis of
their utility and feasibility, round after round.
Berlin, the historian, quotes the semiconductor veteran Robert Noyce, who
compared the Valley’s generational changes to “re-stocking the stream I fished
from.” In other words, as soon as founders achieve success, they give back to the
community that made their ascent possible, either through venture capital or
through advice and support. Here, too, foreigners play a key role. More than half
of all companies that were created in the Valley between 1995 and 2005 have at
least one foreigner as a founder. “Silicon Valley,” Berlin says, “is built and
sustained by immigrants. No place else – including Silicon Valley itself in its
2015 incarnation – could ever reproduce the unique concoction of academic
research, technology, countercultural ideals and a California-specific type of Gold
Rush reputation that attracts people with a high tolerance for risk and very little to
lose.”
So, what exactly do short- and long-term visitors from Germany take back home
with them, aside from impressions and anecdotes?
For Telekom manager Neubert, besides the prospect of future partnerships there
is “always a hefty dose of euphoria.” Anyone who spends a fast-paced week visiting
technology giants like Apple, Cisco or Google – while meeting with a select group
of exciting startups to boot – can easily feel dizzied by so much self-confident
innovative power. The new ideas have to be digested and, above all, reconciled with
the business operations that the visitors are accustomed to back home. Neubert’s
visitors therefore generally need “one to two weeks before they settle back into their
daily routine and see what they can do in their own company.”
During their visits, German companies also learn that everyday life in California
casts a very different light on German corporate culture, in which everything
follows orderly lines. “You realize that you have to be willing to test more new
ideas and think in a more application-oriented way. And this,” Augustin says, “is a
very different way of thinking for a large company which has always defined
88 S. Heuer
centralized solutions down to the smallest detail. If you have your eye on
decentralized solutions for end customers, you won’t and can’t always have an
answer to every single question. If you always hesitate to practically implement and
integrate changes, a lot of good ideas will pass you by.”
The networking and learning opportunities in the Valley range from large
symposia and conferences held by big companies and ambitious startups, to
top-class discussions at the more than 30 universities and colleges in the unparalleled
higher-education landscape led by Stanford and Berkeley. But co-working
spaces and smaller, more casual, sometimes even spontaneously organized
meetings are also an ideal arena for presenting new concepts and floating ideas to
a knowledgeable audience – always in the hopes of receiving honest feedback and
forging new bonds with like-minded technology and business experts. Visitors are
quickly tempted to attend a lot of events where they can meet founders, established
players and investors – and half a dozen such events are held every single day.
For all of the excitement, a healthy dose of skepticism is called for as well, as Sven
Paukstadt notes. Paukstadt, the Senior Manager Partnering at Deutsche Telekom’s
headquarters in Bonn, visited Neubert’s office in Silicon Valley from February to
April 2013. He was immediately struck by the pronounced self-confidence of the tech
scene there. “Everyone looks to the Valley, everyone thinks it’s cool, and the locals
have internalized that,” Paukstadt recalls. “The people there are totally sure of
themselves and act as though nothing that anyone else is doing matters.”
After three months full of networking events and talks with potential partners,
however, Paukstadt realized that German companies had no reason to hide from
California’s technology stronghold. “European enterprises are nowhere near as
slow and sedate as they’re often made out to be. And despite all the hype, a lot of
startups aren’t doing anything special,” the Telekom manager says in retrospect. “If
you’ve structured your processes well, you can work just as quickly and usually
even more thoroughly than a startup from the Valley, especially in terms of
contracts and implementation.” This unexpected insight into the qualities of
our homegrown ecosystem is another valuable takeaway from these innovation
expeditions to the other side of the world.

China as the Frontrunner in Digitalization 9
Clas Neumann
9.1 Introduction
If we take a moment to consider how digitalization is affecting industry or our own
personal lives, the vast majority of us would probably think of the self-driving car,
smart homes, the factory of the future or – more generally – the Internet of Things
and its parallels in Industry 4.0.
If prompted to clarify the source or key driver for such trends, all experts then
immediately point to the West Coast of the USA. Most would include the East
Coast, with many also citing Germany and Japan, and a few suggesting Israel or
South Korea. The world’s most populous and economically dynamic countries –
China and India – do not usually feature in these kinds of global rankings.
While China’s economic clout has earned it the accolade of being a key market
and dominant producer of any digital product one cares to mention, China’s
prevailing image in the mind of the typical Western corporate executive is still
that of a contract manufacturer. Terms such as innovation, leadership or creativity
are less typically used to describe China than qualities such as scalability, efficiency,
replication and simplification.
Yet it’s easy to overlook the fact that China is already a leader in many industrial
manufacturing sectors and not merely as regards production capacity or market size
but in terms of China’s ability to develop innovative products in these areas. One
example worth mentioning here is telecommunications equipment, where Huawei
and ZTE have not only become global market leaders but continue to surprise their
customers with novel and innovative ideas – such as Huawei’s VTA (Virtual Teller
Agent) and VTC (Virtual Teller Center). For mobile devices, too, many new
players such as Lenovo, Huawei and Xiaomi have appeared, who have made it

their business to market devices that are able to satisfy the tastes (and price points)
of customers worldwide. This has not been achieved by the mindless copying of
existing devices that can be made more cheaply due to very high volume production,
but by the canny optimization of conceptual ideas and a deliberate avoidance
of unnecessary features (a topic we will return to later).
For now, however, we need to clarify what a ‘digital frontrunner’ means when
applied to an entire country.
While identifying the leading ‘digital’ companies remains a very simple task,
applying the same criteria from a regional perspective is a more difficult matter.
Simplifying the problem slightly, a country (or a region) is considered to be a digital
frontrunner if the geographic area in question produces an above-average number
of innovations or innovative companies that are making significant progress in the
field of digitalization. At the same time, however, the country in question must have
a large number of users and the infrastructure in place to permit a high degree of
market penetration for new products and services.
On this view, Silicon Valley is unquestionably one of the world’s digital
frontrunners, but Bangalore in South India doesn’t really make the grade – since
both the capital city and state have substandard infrastructure, despite fielding an
above-average number of IT companies and software developers.
Other criteria that work to define a ‘digital frontrunner’ are:
– Startups that benefit from a positive ecosystem (i.e. the optimum interplay of
available talent and capital) to engage in continuous research on new and
pioneering ideas;
– Major corporations, state-run research institutions or universities that are wellintegrated
into the ecosystem;
– The user base and its willingness and ability to try something new;
– Opportunities for the R&D community to engage in the open exchange of ideas,
i.e. the use of ‘clusters’ to encourage and promote mutual inspiration;
– Last but not least, the role of government programs in promoting and protecting
innovation and intellectual property must also be mentioned.
This chapterwill aim to shedmore light on China’s potential as a digital frontrunner –
especially in terms of the global role that China is capable of playing in this area.
9.2 Market Size and Consumer Usage Potential
That China is a global leader in consumer mobile usage has been common knowledge
for a while now: Not only are the cell phones in active use (1.2 billion) almost
as numerous as the population (1.3 billion), but China was also the first country in
92 C. Neumann
the world to announce (in 2012) that more people use their cell phone than their PC
for Internet access (cf. ◉ Fig. 9.1). In 2014, over 400 million cell phones were sold
in China – a figure that also demonstrates the willingness of end users to purchase
state-of-the-art technology and a personal stake in the very latest developments.
That this has more to do with acquiring status symbols than an infatuation with
technology is of secondary importance. The end result is that over a third of cellular
telephony users bought a new mobile device in 2014.
Thanks to China’s protectionist strategy, its market for the mobile Internet is also
well-defended: In both the network provider segment and the cloud services sector,
foreign companies are forbidden from positioning themselves in the market as
independent providers. Only a handful of local providers are used for chat, blog
and social media services, with US corporations such as Google and Facebook being
effectively excluded from the market by the “Great Firewall of China.” This state of
affairs has not only promoted large Chinese companies such as Sina-Weibo, Alibaba
and Tencent to market leadership but has allowed them to offer consumers a new and
more diverse range of services, rather than simply copying Facebook, Twitter & Co.
The huge growth rates enjoyed by Internet companies speak for themselves, and
since 2014, when Alibaba successfully completed what was to become the largest
IPO in history, an awareness of this status quo has also been growing in the Western
world. Both Alibaba and Tencent have seen revenues surge in the past, and their
growth continues unabated to this day. China has been the world’s largest
e-commerce market for some time now.
The primary beneficiaries of the de facto walling-off of the Chinese market for
Internet and cloud services have been the Chinese companies in these sectors.
Insulated from foreign competition, solutions and innovations have developed
that are unquestionably global leaders in their fields.
Fig. 9.1 China – Mobile Internet access vs. PC Internet access
9 China as the Frontrunner in Digitalization 93
9.3 B2B
In 2015, the B2B market in China grew to encompass the almost unimaginable size of
1.3 billion US dollars with three quarters of total e-commerce revenue (i.e. goods that
are either sold or distributed via e-commerce) being earned in this sector (cf. ◉ Fig. 9.2).
Unlike Europe, therefore, China has managed to establish its own search engines,
social media services and leading e-commerce providers – with more than a little help
from state protectionism. The sustainability of this success will be decided not only
in terms of global competition (e.g. WeChat vs. Facebook and Instagram) but also in
the continuous enhancement of these products, including improved access for the
global developer community. Ideally, a frontrunner is both a market and a technology
leader – and this is something China still needs to demonstrate in a global context.
9.4 Industrial Trends in Digitalization
9.4.1 Industrial Use of Information Technology: A Baseline
In terms of the industrial use of information technology, China has yet to take the
lead. Although many companies deploy ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
systems and a high degree of automation, a look at the annual reports of the
major multinational software and hardware system suppliers tells us that the
markets in Europe and the USA are still dominant for this sector. And yet: China
Fig. 9.2 E-Commerce Transaction US and China
94 C. Neumann
has already muscled its way into the Top Five at almost every global IT corporation
and it is surely only a question of time before China also becomes the largest buyer
for this sector.
As noted in the introduction, however, while consumption and size may bring
substantial benefits of scale they do not necessarily position China well for the role
of trendsetter. Deloitte’s 2013 Global Manufacturing Competitiveness Index
Report awards indexes of 9.47, 8.94 and 8.14 to Germany, the USA and Japan,
respectively, while China trails behind with an index of 5.89. For too long, “cheap
China” has been content to leverage production scale and labor cost advantages,
and rely on technology transfer. This has not only resulted in the gradual erosion of
competitiveness but has meant insufficient attention has been given to the necessity
for continuous, broad-spectrum innovation within production.
A currency that has steadily strengthened from year to year combined with
significant increases in wages is now working to place China at a disadvantage
vis-a`-vis many other Asian countries in terms of unit labor costs. The (to an extent
politically motivated) trend in the USA for bringing production “back home” has
also served to strongly focus the minds of corporate decision-makers on China’s
shortcomings here. Apple’s 2012 decision to relocate production of its Mac series
computers back to the US from China made headlines the world over.
This was naturally recognized by China, which used politics and PR in an
attempt to play down the incident.
9.4.2 Chinese Government Programs for Achieving Digital Market
Dominance
China has recognized the importance of digitalization both for its industry and its
people, and has adopted various strategies aimed at achieving both domestic and
international predominance.
China’s non-stop focus on driving mobile network expansion over the last few
years means that it now not only has the most cellular network users in the world –
and that by a wide margin – but is also the first country in which cell phone-based
Internet access now exceeds PC Internet usage. In addition, the Chinese government
has actively encouraged its citizens to make greater use of the Internet and
offers many state services via apps.
This has led to fundamental changes affecting social life: In some cities,
providers and consumers have become so used to phone-based services that it has
now become very difficult to hail a cab without the right taxi app. And there are
probably very few Chinese of the younger generation who haven’t yet shopped
online on Taobao or T-Mall – the world’s biggest marketplace for almost anything
produced worldwide. According to figures from A.T. Kearney, online shopping
(B2C) volume totaled about 400 billion US dollars in 2014 and is forecast to rise by
25 percent annually until 2017. Most customers in the B2C segment are aged
between 18 and 35: Overall, some 300 million Chinese make online purchases on
a regular basis. This makes China the world leader in online retail, with a volume
already twice the size of the US market.
9 China as the Frontrunner in Digitalization 95
Strong support is provided by the government in the form of the MIIT (Ministry
for Industry and Information Technology), while the Ministry for Cybersecurity
simultaneously keeps a watchful eye on anything (and everything) else in the online
world.
Nonetheless, not only were many Chinese companies early pioneers in the field
of mobile payments (WeChat Payment Wallet, Alipay), but many business processes
were in fact digitalized for the end customer earlier in China than in the USA
or Germany. The government in Beijing is therefore attempting to balance massively
increased use of the Internet – and social networks and e-commerce in
particular – with equally pervasive control of its content.
While social media is used by government agencies and party officials as an
effective means of communicating with the population, it is also a useful tool for
learning about trending topics (e.g. dissatisfaction about local grievances) early
enough to be able to counter them appropriately.
At the same time, there is also an official Internet censor tasked with keeping the
network free of “harmful influences” – which is naturally a very broad-based job.
Everything posted online as “content” in China must either be officially approved or
at least comply with a set of clearly-defined parameters. These rules, which are
published openly and therefore common knowledge, can work to delay content
processes – especially as regards the exchange of information or the dissemination
of knowledge.
In terms of industrial digitalization, the key focus since 2014 has been on the two
major government programs of Made in China 2025 and Internet+.
Internet+ is expressly dedicated to the principle that the Internet (and IT as a
whole) must develop beyond the conventional idea of hardware and software towards
a triple concord of hardware, software and data. This involves the systematic
integration of cloud computing, big data, the Internet of Things and mobile Internet.
This might sound run-of-the-mill at first – as “mobile,” “big data” and “cloud” can
now be found (in various constellations) in almost any company presentation.
However, China’s integrated approach of attempting to harvest the various
trends or counter-trends and simultaneously harness their utility for business (the
finance sector is a key target here) is unquestionably superior to that found in many
other countries. This is then implemented in a series of practical programs – such as
the financing of 100 pilot projects. Or the new free trade zone in Shanghai, which is
intended to exploit new opportunities for cloud computing without the restrictions
that apply in the rest of China.
The declared objective is to achieve the position of a global leader in the use of
IT and in digitalization – in both industry and day-to-day life – within the next
five years. This also chimes well with Gartner’s forecast, which expects the size of
the total public cloud market to reach 20.7 billion US dollars by 2018, assuming an
initial size of 5.3 billion US dollars in 2013 and a compound annual growth rate
(CAGR) of 31.5 percent (cf. Gartner 2014).
Planned and published outside the typical five year period, Made in China 2025
makes a highly unexpected break with tradition, a fact that highlights the importance
of this initiative for the government. Essentially, the program involves
“upgrading” Chinese industry to handle the new era. The initial scope of the
96 C. Neumann
program is fairly broad, adopting a general approach to improving the quality of
Chinese products and increasing the efficiency of production processes. Since many
companies (due to the long period of very low labor costs) are only beginning to
consider automation (and therefore the transition from Industry 2.0 to Industry 3.0),
digitalization has a significant but not all-encompassing role to play in many
scenarios (cf. ◉ Fig. 9.3). The program’s core principles are “quality, not quantity,”
ecologically-viable improvements in manufacturing, the optimization of
manufacturing structures and talent development.
Attention is not focused solely on efficient production control or the introduction
of “cyber physical systems,” as they are referred to in the Industry 4.0 whitepaper
from Acatech. Another key goal is to improve the integration of Chinese production
in global value chains and thus, naturally, to increase the proportion of the value
thereby created. In many factories operated by FoxConn, the Chinese iPhone manufacturer,
this proportion is 1.9 percent: The lion’s share of value creation (and also the
profit) thus remains in the hands of other companies – and first and foremost Apple.
Rich rewards lie in store for those Chinese producers who manage to improve
the integration of domestic production with their buyers (and end customers, as
appropriate).
Here, the holistic approach taken by Made in China 2025 will certainly help to
lay the foundations for a reform of the Chinese manufacturing industry.
In summary, although China’s shortcomings in terms of competitiveness across
global markets are clear to see, the government in Beijing is nonetheless making
huge efforts to modernize Chinese manufacturing. This has already resulted in clear
improvements to productivity and should help ensure the same for quality in the
next phase. The degree to which funds are in fact allocated and whether
manufacturing successfully weathers the reforms are aspects that require careful
Fig. 9.3 Ten Key Sectors “Made in China 2025”
9 China as the Frontrunner in Digitalization 97
monitoring. Despite a few model factories run by foreign producers – Bosch in
Suzhou, Siemens in Chengdu – this transformation has yet to be applied across the
board in China. Ultimately, however, it is economic pressure, combined with the
government’s firm convictions and earmarked funding, that offers China the best
chance to leverage its economies of scale and make Industry 4.0 a reality.
9.5 Innovation
In the topics discussed above, we have discovered that in the usage of digital products
and the networking of its professional and consumer users China is a clear leader in
terms of sheer size. And it won’t be long before China is the largest market and the
largest producer for virtually any product or service of relevance in the digital world.
At the same time, however, stories continue to surface about stolen ideas, patent
infringements and copies accurate in every detail – which has helped create the
impression that China is simply unable to innovate.
Yet China certainly has an excellent chance of taking the lead with innovative
products, and especially in the process of digitalizing its economy, for the following
reasons:
1. Market dominance will force increasing numbers of companies to disclose
knowledge (technology transfer) and Chinese companies will catch up rapidly. It’s
no secret: Anyone wanting to enjoy long-term success in China must be open to
technology transfer. The Chinese government makes no bones about its declared
intention of allowing market entry to strategic industries (such as aircraft construction,
rail, IT) only on the condition that the corresponding products are also
manufactured in China or that at least part of the value chain is located in China.
In the end, most companies agree to these terms since China is a market that is
simply too important to be ignored. Things won’t be any different for digitalization:
In this context, source code may need to be disclosed (due to security
concerns, for example) or certain services (especially within networking and
cloud computing) will be marketable only in tandem with a Chinese JV partner.
Ultimately, a lot of knowledge will change hands. And even if companies
manage to design new products in ever shorter cycles, the Chinese partner will of
course be trained as well, Chinese employees will gain new knowledge and
colleges, too, will include the content in their programs. In this way, the
foundations for local technology development can be laid (cf. railway construction
or solar technology).
2. The protection of patents and intellectual property rights is taken far more
seriously today in China than in the last decade. The Chinese government has
long since realized that the defense of intellectual property is in its own interest.
For many years after the opening up of the PRC, protecting intellectual property
was a low-priority goal. After all, it contradicted the core principle of socialism,
namely that “property” only exists in a very restricted sense. Why then, should
the ownership of abstract ideas be protected?
98 C. Neumann
Ultimately, however, repeated pressure from overseas partners and then
Chinese companies themselves eventually led to a rethinking of policy here.
China realized that patents are outstandingly amenable to commercialization,
and that a lack of effective protection for its own products in global markets and
within its own borders stood in the way of its globalization goals. Intellectual
property consultants Wurzer & Kollegen provide a neat summary of the situation
and managing director Alexander Wurzer himself sees the developments as
clearly heralding China’s entry into an entirely new phase in terms of handling
intellectual property: “China’s relationship to intellectual property in phase
1 was initially characterized by extensive counterfeiting and copying on the
part of Chinese companies. In phase 2, this transitioned into the steady buying-in
of foreign technologies and licenses, which increasingly enabled the former
counterfeiters and imitators to position themselves as legal and innovative
competitors. The report documents China’s entry into a new, third phase: the
systematic establishment of an international patent portfolio based on domestic
innovations that is suitable for targeted deployment against competitors by
exercising rights of prohibition, actions for injunctions, or by demanding the
payment of compensation or license fees.”
Chinese companies (and in the field of information technology, these
companies are legion) are highly competent at protecting themselves and successfully
deploying their own patents. As a result, both domestic R&D and
domestic innovation have now been accorded an entirely different status. This
is also highlighted by the rising number of patent applications (patent
registrations are now significantly higher in China than in the US; cf. ◉
Fig. 9.4). In July 2015, Wirtschaftswoche magazine reported that the 2500
patents registered since 2013 by China related to enabling technologies for the
Internet of Things (IoT) amounted to double the US patent volume and six times
that of Germany. One should note that the level of innovation represented by
such patents is not always comparable, however. One final word on patent
protection in China: Recent instances of patent litigation, such as the cases
brought by German SME Herting in January 2015 (alleging infringement of
patents for specialized electrical connectors) and Apple in 2014 (related to ‘Siri’
voice recognition) have been decided in favor of the overseas plaintiff. This, too,
signals the general change in attitude and further strengthens the trend towards
greater innovation and legal protection.
3. Increased spending on research and development. After the USA, China is
already the country with the second-highest level of spending on R&D. Should
China achieve its goal of ploughing at least three percent of GNP back into
research by 2020, then, according to figures from the OECD, it will be the
country with the highest level of R&D spending (cf. see ◉ Fig. 9.5).
For many years, Beijing’s focus was on the creation of infrastructure and
production capacity. Yet this strategy is now no longer an adequate guarantor
of healthy economic growth into the future. Accordingly, a rethink has
been taking place at all levels of government, and funding in R&D has recently
been significantly increased (approx. 300 billion US dollars in 2014 alone).
9 China as the Frontrunner in Digitalization 99
Since 2014, there has also been a particular focus on the digitalization of
manufacturing. One should expect that China will make every effort possible
to equip its higher education and research institutions with a level of funding that
is appropriate for attracting international experts and upgrading technical
facilities to the technological state of the art.
Fig. 9.5 China vs. USA: Outlook on Research & Development Spending
Fig. 9.4 China’s Innovative Capacity
100 C. Neumann
4. Systematic improvements to durability, simplification and processes. Why
has China never created an iPhone? Why was the PC developed in the USA?
Why was the MP3 format invented in Germany? While often asked, these
questions all suffer from an over-simplification of the larger picture: Only a
handful of innovations are actually cited (and in particular those that have been
successful on the consumer market) and the timespan considered is very short
(the last 20 years). If we were to expand the time frame to, say, 3,000 years, then
China instead becomes the land of continuous, game-changing innovation. Even
if we restrict our view to the last few decades, however, while we might not be
able to identify a product that everyone in the world now uses, it still remains a
fact that the phones or tablets we enjoy (and buy for no more than a couple of
hundred euros) are the result of Chinese factories using highly innovative
manufacturing processes. And these processes, tools and quality assurance
systems are protected by a broad portfolio of patents. In many cases, products
are also developed further to meet the needs of the Chinese market – the aim
often being to achieve a less complex and/or more rugged product design while
not compromising on performance. Chinese high-speed trains are an excellent
example in this context. While a good deal of German technology comes along
for the ride (e.g. from Siemens or brake manufacturer Duerr), a considerable
amount of money (and R&D effort) has been spent on making locomotives more
reliable and reducing their maintenance needs, etc. “Good enough, but at a much
lower price point” is the maxim, and this has been China’s secret weapon in
global markets stretching from Turkey to Brazil and across the African continent.
In May 2015, the Handelsblatt business newspaper reported that Deutsche
Bahn was also considering China as a supplier of trains and spare parts. If we
consider the digital factory of the future, China stands to benefit hugely from this
strategy. After all, future technology must also be manageable by human users:
If it can avoid the pitfall of hopelessly overburdening its operators, then it will
also be less error-prone. The digital factory of the future will not necessarily
need the most expensive plant networked with a full array of cutting-edge
technologies, but will deploy an intelligent system of proven components
while still approaching the limits of what is technically possible.
5. Beijing’s clear focus and market player bundling. The highly relevant government
programs Internet+ and Made in China 2025 have been discussed
above. Complementing these, China has also established a series of highlyfocused
programs aimed at driving the digitalization of the economy. While
the effectiveness of such programs can be debated and – as with any government
program – misallocation of resources will no doubt be rife, these programs work
to create one thing above all else: focus. This gives all of China’s political and
economic stakeholders the shared objectives of making better commercial use of
the Internet while simultaneously modernizing industrial manufacturing. These
are, after all, two complementary goals that offer many opportunities for working
together. Chinese companies will (with gentle encouragement from “above”)
utilize these opportunities and – especially when backed by the government –
attempt to bring a large number of international partners on board. This can be
9 China as the Frontrunner in Digitalization 101
arranged in the form of collaboration agreements with a few partners. Then
again, some Chinese IT companies have also joined the major global industrial
associations, as is the case with Huawei, which is now a member of the Industrial
Internet Alliance founded by US companies. This will lead to further knowledge
transfer – whether involving standards, security models or many other fundamental
topics. From this starting-point, China will develop its own version of the
networked Industry 4.0 (as it has of course already done very successfully in
B2C) and, thanks to the great agility of its companies, will aim to “upgrade”
these new technologies into global standards by means of exports. This future
can already be seen in current developments. Customers can use the Chinese
“Unionpay” card in any shop in D€usseldorf or Frankfurt. Many German online
shops also accept “Alipay” payments. We can therefore assume that the same
will happen in the field of networked robots, plant systems and customers.
Perhaps not as a unified standard (as the US would certainly move to block
such an outcome) but as an alternative standard.
6. Talent (local and international). Sustainable progress depends on having the
right subject specialists, experts and visionaries (in moderation). Silicon Valley
is the textbook example of how a mixture of first-class universities, capital, and
domestic and international migration has created a one-of-a-kind high-tech
ecosystem. While China is investing heavily in higher education, it is struggling
to cover its needs for subject specialists. Outside the Top 20 universities,
education is also significantly less comprehensive and state-of-the-art. A further
problem is that too much knowledge is simply crammed and learned by rote and
too little emphasis is placed on creative thinking. Then again, China is benefiting
from the increasing appeal of its labor market – especially in its high-tech
clusters. This is bringing a lot of Chinese top talent back to China. With
considerable improvements being made to living conditions, foreign experts
are now also flocking to China’s larger cities. And local salaries for top
executives are now significantly higher than those paid in Germany.
Yet for a radical process of digitalization it is not so much software developers
and IT experts that are lacking but, ultimately, the skilled workers who can bring
all these plans to fruition. A prodigious gap is opening up here, and it probably
cannot be closed quickly enough to keep pace with rising demand.
Compounding this problem, we can also see how shortcomings in the exchange
of ideas, concepts and new solutions on international platforms or blogs are
working to isolate users and software developers in China from important
sources of knowledge. This will work to disadvantage China in the long term,
since its “Great Firewall” (like the erstwhile Great Wall of China) will act as a
barrier to the rest of the world, and neither students nor experts will be fully
aware of events beyond its borders. This is perhaps one of the greatest obstacles
to China’s plans to become a leader in the digitalization of manufacturing and
business in general: Openness and the unimpeded exchange of new ideas about
interesting technologies, shared, cross-border development on common software
projects – all of this will be needed if China wants to prove its mettle as a
global digital frontrunner and not as a clever “nerd” stuck behind a wall.
102 C. Neumann
9.6 Conclusion
Is China really a digital frontrunner? Applying the criteria listed in the introduction,
we can draw the following conclusions.
There can be few doubts about the tech-savviness of Chinese customers – nor of
their numbers: In key Internet-related sectors (B2B, e-commerce, etc.), China is
currently the world’s largest market. We can also assume that the same will very
soon be true for the entire spectrum of products for the ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT).
Starting from this strong position, there will be a considerable need for technology
and know-how, some of which will be satisfied by transfer from foreign technology
leaders and some (increasingly) by development within China itself. More and
more Chinese customers will also be expecting – and making use of – innovative
enhancements.
China is also rapidly upgrading its ecosystem: Universities, companies and staterun
R&D institutions are increasingly pooling their resources and benefiting from
such cooperation. Startups are also becoming much more numerous – some with
international co-founders who act as stimulators in their sectors. The ecosystem
now has everything it needs.
There has also been a real paradigm shift in government programs and the
funding of innovation. If resources are properly deployed and intellectual property
rights are concurrently strengthened, this is an area with a lot of potential. Initial
efforts here are on the right track.
The innovative strength of the economy at large is a more problematic issue,
however. While China does have its innovative hot spots, such as Beijing, Shanghai/
Nanjing, Xi’an or Guangzhou/Shenzhen, true clusters cannot really be identified –
especially considering the size of these economic areas. While the sheer volume of
patents and businesses is impressive, calculation of the figures per student, facility or
company shows that a comparatively small country such as Israel is far more
innovative. In the wider economy, SMEs in particular are still lagging very far behind.
Turning finally to consider community, talent and the sharing of ideas, this is
where the key challenges for digitalization are to be found. China is unlikely to be
able to master the enormous challenges involved in educating and training the
skilled professionals and workers required for a comprehensive reform of the
manufacturing sector. Equally, the firewalling of the entire Internet in today’s day
and age (in which students source a large part of their current knowledge from the
web) is very counter-productive. Not least because the filters that “protect” the
Chinese Web are fairly heavy-handed and block a lot of useful content. Speed
losses are also enormous, making it virtually impossible to engage in rapid data
exchange with the global business community.
This is where China really has its work cut out, and it will be interesting to see
the home-grown solutions developed here.
Industry 4.0 is the great opportunity for Chinese manufacturing to make a
quantum leap in terms of its modernization and leapfrog over an entire industrial
era. If this proves successful (bolstered by government programs, massive spending,
improved education and the migration of highly skilled experts), then China
will mature into the global market and innovation leader in digitalization.
9 China as the Frontrunner in Digitalization 103
As for foreign companies, these should lose no time in getting involved and
participating in the trends that are already being set within China today. Only those
who engage (and partner) with the Chinese competition on its home turf today will
know their competitors in the global markets of the future.

IT islands – they rise up from the flood of data in every corporation and every
medium-sized company. As sunny as they may sound, they cast a long shadow over
a company’s flexibility. In this dynamic age of digital transformation, effective
administration is wrecked on the shores of these islands. In reality there are often
local databases, each of which has grown independently for years and now holds
layer upon layer of a quarter century of IT history. These IT landscapes are almost
impossible to manage efficiently, and their complexity leads to inefficient and
opaque processes which waste the valuable energy of IT employees and CEOs
alike. It starts in day-to-day business: Existing data is needlessly recorded multiple
times, and relevant information is not taken into account in new developments
because no one knows it exists – or where it can be found. Ergo, even as companies
merge and become one, their IT remains fragmented across different sites. This was
the case at thyssenkrupp – and we wanted to change it. International companies in
particular require agility, flexibility, global communication and cooperation in
order to gain a competitive advantage. One of thyssenkrupp’s goals, therefore, is
to consolidate and harmonize its existing IT landscape worldwide.
10.1 Flexible IT with the Cloud
To break open rigid structures, you need a consolidated enterprise resource
planning (ERP) backbone as well as a comprehensive solution: the cloud. The
cloud creates a shared platform and offers an opportunity to ease the strain on your
in-house IT. Furthermore, the right IT partner can ensure global availability and
increased flexibility. This allows the company to focus on its core areas of business:
engineering, production and logistics. In global corporations such as thyssenkrupp,

this business is handled by different and sometimes alternating sites – wherever
there is available capacity, resources and customers. But the data always has to be
right where it’s needed, and it has to be available in formats that can be further
processed. Resource planning and customer management cannot be limited to
specific sites or departments because this impedes business. Agility and flexibility,
by contrast, can be achieved through standard applications which can be used in the
cloud in the form of software-as-a-service (SaaS) and can directly access the
available data, as well as through workplaces that are no longer tied to local servers
and user accounts. With centralized administration, it takes no extra effort to ensure
that all employees are working with the same version of applications, all necessary
updates are installed regularly, the data remains compatible and no security gaps are
ignored or go undetected locally.
The fourth industrial revolution, which follows three previous revolutions –
mechanization, mass production and digitalization – relies on the factors of information
and communication. Whether the “Internet of Things” means that things are
connected to each other or humans are included in this exchange, the smooth flow
of data is what will guarantee business success in the future. This is both a challenge
and an opportunity for the economy. And it is such important terrain that competent,
integrative partners are called for. This is why thyssenkrupp opted for
T-Systems. The planned global harmonization of thyssenkrupp’s data and processes
and the standardization of its workplaces required the kind of high availability that
T-Systems can offer with its twin-core data centers. It was necessary to find a
stable solution which guaranteed the reliable use of standard components and the
migration of existing company solutions to the cloud, thus doing justice to the
diversity of the company and its multinational business areas.
10.2 The Starting Point
thyssenkrupp is no longer associated solely with steel and iron. Steel Europe and
Steel Americas are just two of the group’s six business areas. The rest is handled by
the other business areas: Components Technology, Elevator Technology, Industrial
Solutions and Materials Services. The group consists of around 500 companies with
sales of about 41 billion euros, which means that it’s a heavyweight in the industry.
And so is the project that thyssenkrupp launched at the start of 2015 with
T-Systems: A good 80,000 computer workplaces and around 700 data centers and
server rooms will be moving to the cloud in the space of 36 months. The project to
turn thyssenkrupp into an integrated corporation involves more than 155,000
employees at about 1,700 sites in roughly 80 countries.
10.3 From the Public Cloud to the Private Cloud
thyssenkrupp aims to establish a group-wide integrated IT landscape which makes
global communication and cooperation easier and more efficient while also meeting
the different IT requirements of each business area. The cloud is the ideal vehicle
106 K.H. M€uhleck
for this. The easiest way to get started is by using the public cloud, which offers the
chance to launch and test applications. The public cloud provides access to webmail
and virtual drives as well as applications, collaboration services, platforms and
infrastructure services. In Asia, for example, thyssenkrupp uses Microsoft Office
365 to keep more than 10,000 mailboxes in the public cloud. But the cloud can do
much more: In an IoT lighthouse project, started in the USA, Germany and Spain as
pilot countries, thyssenkrupp Elevator has been using a cloud for the Industry 4.0-
connectivity of its elevators. By means of predictive analytics, the data collected
from the elevators is analyzed so that flexible maintenance intervals can be planned
in advance, which massively reduces downtimes and transportation standstills.
The public version of the cloud is just the first step into the cloud for
thyssenkrupp, however. The overarching strategy behind the group’s “unite” IT
consolidation program is to migrate more than 500 domains and active directories,
around 700 data centers and server rooms and over 10,000 applications from the
decentralized IT landscape to the private cloud of T-Systems in order to ensure
highly secure, standardized, global IT availability. The private cloud offers two key
advantages over the public cloud here: solutions tailored to thyssenkrupp for
protecting the group’s intellectual property and personal data (keywords: data
protection and information security), and dedicated access rights which mean that
only company employees or authenticated users can access and use the IT infrastructure
and its applications. These include services which are already in the public
cloud, such as the maintenance service of thyssenkrupp Elevator, an important
division with over 50,000 employees.
10.4 Greater Efficiency through New Architectures
The cloud is therefore expected to deliver a lot in terms of performance. But what
do you do if the cloud cannot manage this? An elevator is a good example of the
potential offered by the cloud: An elevator not only connects floors, it connects
people. And, just like an elevator, data and applications have to be where they are
needed – the faster, more directly and more securely, the better. If you are prepared
to rethink architectures and standardize (data) structures, you can give a boost to
efficiency and workflows. This kind of flexible construction doesn’t only exist
figuratively, however – in the case of the elevator, we can see it in the “Multi”
concept. Multi is a brand-new elevator technology developed by thyssenkrupp
which will bring greater flexibility to the construction of high-rises in the future.
Skyscrapers have always been constrained by elevators being pulled vertically
through their cores, but the new Multi elevator concept fundamentally changes
this. With Multi, the elevator comes to the passengers and picks them up where they
are. It is based on a technology that does away with the familiar rope and instead
uses magnetic levitation to send cabins through a building. This makes it possible
for elevators to move horizontally as well. Not only can the elevator navigate
flexibly, it can also act as part of a group along with other elevators, which can
dodge one another and be requested at specific times – peak times, for example,
10 The Cloud Drives Harmonization and Standardization 107
such as the start of the working day or the arrival of a bus for an event. This is
Industry 4.0 par excellence: The application eliminates crowds in front of elevator
doors by evaluating traffic flow data, while preventive maintenance reduces
downtimes. And all of this is made possible by the cloud.
Above all, Multi illustrates a key point: Technologies are entering our everyday
lives in a variety of ways. But they will only add value if they are available and
functional. The cloud lays the foundation for this. It also lays the foundation for
more flexibility: Just as Multi allows for new architectures that have never existed
before, the cloud allows for network architectures that were previously unthinkable.
And – just like the elevator – it ensures more flexibility, availability, speed and
safety.
10.5 Dynamic Workplaces from the Cloud
Flexibility is a decisive advantage of a company-wide cloud solution: Data is
accessible, applications can be used, and documents and information are available
whenever an employee needs them. This is what thyssenkrupp has achieved using
the Dynamic Workplace from T-Systems. This solution gives employees permanent,
secure access to their personal workplace in the T-Systems cloud. Workplace
operating systems and desktop applications are virtualized, so the user is completely
independent of a specific end device or mobile operating system. In order to
access the system, users must authenticate themselves, which they can easily do in a
browser or an app. Users operate their workstations in much the same way as
before – something that was important to thyssenkrupp. This means employees do
not need to familiarize themselves with an entirely new digital working world, new
workplace environments or programs. Instead, they can use familiar applications
that have simply migrated to the cloud while at the same time enjoying the benefits
of a new infrastructure that offers permanent access to their stored data. On top of
this, there is more security – regardless of the end device.
The variability of the end devices leads to increased mobility for users as well as
simple administration, because new workplaces can be created easily. All
workplaces are virtualized centrally in T-Systems data centers, where all of the
applications run and all of the data is stored. This significantly reduces the cost of
hardware for thyssenkrupp, particularly for maintenance, system set-up, software
installation and updates. Because the processing takes place in the cloud, no
additional demands are placed on the hardware.
An approach like this paves the way for cost-efficient end devices, but it also
offers the option of continuing to use existing PCs. This is a particularly important
factor in the transition phase, which can last for years in a big project like this. It
means that employees can keep using the old, decentralized system environment
while the new infrastructure is being established and the applications are gradually
added. As a result, the IT infrastructure can be harmonized and standardized
without interrupting functioning business processes.
108 K.H. M€uhleck
10.6 The Location Question
It was clear relatively early on that thyssenkrupp did not want to run its own data
centers in the long term. The complexity of this – which would continue to grow
over the years – would simply tie up too much capacity and money. This is where
the company’s IT partner comes in – a partner who not only has the necessary
expertise but also has the latest technologies and enough data center capacity. This
spares valuable capacity and financial resources which can be applied to the group’s
core business instead.
As an international company, it was essential to thyssenkrupp that its IT partner
have data centers not only in Germany but also internationally.
For its unite consolidation program, thyssenkrupp has access to five twin-core
data centers run by T-Systems. The data centers for Europe are in Frankfurt, the
ones for the USA are in Houston, the ones for China are in Shanghai, and there are
also data centers in Singapore and S~ao Paulo. This is another point in favor of the
private cloud: You can specify where certain data will be stored and where special
applications will run. This kind of controlled local data storage makes it possible for
a global company to comply with the laws and official requirements of each
country. For companies operating worldwide, this issue relates to the protection
and security not only of the company’s own sensitive data, but also of the data
associated with local partner companies or individuals – employees and customers
alike. Data protection needs to be guaranteed in accordance with national laws and
guidelines.
Since it may be mandatory to disclose stored information depending on the
location, it is critical to meticulously plan who may access which data from where
and in what way. The question of where this data is physically stored or – even more
importantly – where it absolutely must not be stored determines whether company
secrets remain secret or not. This also applies to cases such as China, where official
authorization is required before an approved encryption technology can be used.
With T-Systems data centers in both the USA and China, thyssenkrupp is able to
separate its data in order to ensure that it is protected in accordance with the
requirements of each country. This “grounded” data cloud makes it clear that the
term “cloud” is sometimes too imprecise. Information is not actually processed and
stored in a cloud in some indeterminate location. Instead, a company must be able
to precisely pinpoint the location of its entire inventory of data and the applications
that access it. Thanks to the T-Systems data centers – which take account of local
requirements and specifics – data can be processed collaboratively in many different
countries, from the USA to Europe and Asia.
10.7 Top of the Agenda: Data Security
thyssenkrupp benefits from the ability to trace and control the international flow of
data, from the strict data protection legislation and EU regulations that govern
German data centers and from the stability and high availability of the twin-core
10 The Cloud Drives Harmonization and Standardization 109
data centers. The modern technology behind these fully redundant twin data centers
guarantees the greatest possible availability and security. If a disruption unexpectedly
occurs in one of the data centers, its twin core immediately takes over
operations. This should be a top priority for a global corporation, because a
company-wide workplace solution such as the Dynamic Workplace is only reasonable
and economical if the availability of the applications and data in the data center
is assured.
The security aspect also relates to protection against external attacks. After all,
the German domestic intelligence service estimates that the annual damages from
electronic espionage in Germany amount to around 50 billion euros. To protect its
network as much as possible, thyssenkrupp recently adjusted its infrastructure,
defined a four-level security model and invested in protecting its clients and
zones. This security management program is being further refined as “Secure Cell
Management 2.0” together with T-Systems in accordance with German law in order
to safeguard the company’s data. The administration of users and profiles remains
in the hands of thyssenkrupp, while tool management and the interplay of the data
centers and network components are being handled together with T-Systems. This
involves next-gen firewalls as well as state-of-the-art security appliances, semantically
linked CM systems and surveillance systems which monitor traffic.
The virtual concept behind the Dynamic Workplace offers increased security as
well, since there are practically no local weak points anymore. Thanks to
virtualization, which starts on the network level, users are strictly separated and
better protected from one another and from the server. This makes it possible to
centrally manage user access regardless of the device. It also improves the
exchange of data between Dynamic Workplace users, which takes place in the
protected space of the data centers.
10.8 Challenges as a Group
Right from the start, complexity is the biggest challenge when it comes to planning
and thinking about every aspect of a project like this. Even though the cloud will
eventually simplify the IT landscape at thyssenkrupp, the first task is to successfully
transform the existing IT islands. In this case, the entire working environment was
still distributed among various providers or at thyssenkrupp itself, in around
700 data centers and small server rooms. The Dynamic Workplace gives all
employees standardized access to this environment. The obstacles lie in the transformation
itself: Thousands of applications distributed in the field have to be
consolidated and standardized. To do this as efficiently and stringently as possible
in each country, thyssenkrupp initiated its own program (Data and Process
Harmonization, or “daproh”) which is running parallel to unite and is mandatory
for all business areas. The aim is to harmonize processes and applications on the
local level alongside the group-wide IT infrastructure consolidation. The only way
to ultimately achieve a positive result is to harmonize all data and IT processes,
110 K.H. M€uhleck
without exception – from simple communication tools to the business data for ERP
analyses.
thyssenkrupp consists of around 500 companies. As different as these
companies’ products and production chains are, they are all a part of thyssenkrupp.
The task here is to bring together all sub-sections of the group, break down barriers
using data technology and generate the greatest user value. Connections within the
company’s own value chains are urgently needed in order to do business more
effectively, quickly and profitably as a group. Take transportation as an example:
Some parts of the group handle transportation independently, while others use an
overarching transportation management system. The question to be answered by the
management and solved by IT is this: In the future, will each company handle its
own logistics, or will there be worldwide synergies which take transportation
management into an entirely new dimension? The harmonization and
standardization of the processes and data in each company can be achieved most
easily as a group when IT and its infrastructures are moved to the cloud.
International expertise is called for here, too: Anything associated with American
or Chinese legislation, for example, will quickly bump up against countryspecific
obstacles, such as export control regulations. This is why it’s good to have a
global partner who has both a presence and experience in the respective target
markets on the one hand and a feeling for the national details on the other. This
opens up the opportunity for new collaborative models which the partners would
not have been able to initiate as successfully on their own.
10.9 Migration in Two Steps
Even when the goal is a shared cloud, it is necessary to first take a more
differentiated view of the international consolidation of group data. You cannot
simply stuff everything into a cloud. This would overload the cloud and raise false
expectations. Cloud computing essentially means moving data center services –
i.e., server activity – to a network and providing software services in this network.
Cloud computing is not a miracle, it’s an organizational criterion. Cloud computing
enables companies to bring software such as SAP, Oracle or homespun Unix
applications into a large network instead of running them independently in the
company’s local data center. At thyssenkrupp, this network is orchestrated by
T-Systems.
On account of the IT history of the business areas, there were many applications
that were not yet ready for the cloud but needed to be. It is relatively easy to migrate
from the public cloud to the private cloud with applications such as Microsoft
Azure, Dynamics and Office 365, SAP HANA, SuccessFactors, Ariba and IBM
WebSphere. The hard part is porting the thousands of applications across the board
which are not yet in the cloud. This cannot happen overnight. The migration is
therefore taking place gradually at thyssenkrupp. Gradual migration ensures that
the initial plans remain realistic to the end and can be successfully realized –
10 The Cloud Drives Harmonization and Standardization 111
because nothing is left out of the equation, all of the applications are carefully made
ready for the cloud and changes can be addressed as needed.
10.10 Can It Be Done without the Cloud?
Considering this tremendous effort, you might wonder whether it wouldn’t be
easier to leave everything as it is and try to tackle the problems using our own
networked data centers. In brief, the answer is no. This solution would have an
extremely short life span and offer no future prospects for thyssenkrupp. From
corporations to medium-sized companies, data only creates value when it is combined
and exchanged. The better this works and the deeper the analysis, the greater
the value. Industry 4.0 is more important to the economy than pithy reports would
lead us to believe. It is not just about using a scancode to fill a bag of muesli
according to a consumer’s taste preferences, or about manufacturing a clutch on
demand when a special car is ordered. It is about the ability to analyze and visualize
a company’s data at any time and use the results to initiate actions for optimizing
business processes and customer value. All of the data that provides an insight into
a company’s current situation and offers a glimpse of the future through predictive
analytics must be synchronized and linked. This requires a secure global infrastructure,
which is the backbone of our economy. The backbones of our companies need
to meet the same high standards as the goods we produce. These are very different
business areas of a shared economy. It is also critical to know what you do best and
where you should invest. Industrial companies such as thyssenkrupp can simply no
longer afford to run a large number of their own data centers. It takes up too much
capacity and costs too much money, and the market is too dynamic for an in-house
IT department to fully keep up with it. Corporations and medium-sized companies
alike need partners such as T-Systems for this. And these partners, in turn, are
partners to Microsoft, SAP, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce and others – namely, the
providers with whom industrial IT departments have always cooperated directly.
This triad – industrial companies, infrastructure providers and software firms – has
the potential to become a harmonious model for success.
When it comes to the cloud, thyssenkrupp has limited itself to eight to ten
partners who are being orchestrated by T-Systems. It would be unrealistic to
think you could manage everything with a single partner; on the other hand, it is
important to ensure that individual specialized solutions and diversity do not lead to
unmanageable chaos. A cloud arrangement does not require hundreds of partners. If
you have eight to ten cloud platforms which cover your architecture and
applications, everything can be orchestrated harmoniously.
Then you still have choices, you can coordinate processes and not be tied to a
single solution. This is important because it gives you the necessary bandwidth to
go down a new route. A company’s IT department needs this flexibility because,
ideally, it will be the technological partner to the specialist departments which will
realize the necessary solutions. IT is an enabler which works best when it can
almost disappear behind the solution that has been realized. The cloud comes from
112 K.H. M€uhleck
a provider, and the solutions are set up by the respective partners – guided by the IT
department. For example, if a social business network is implemented, the head of
communications and the entire community works on the issue together with the IT
department and the provider. Using this approach, thyssenkrupp’s IT department
managed to develop a prototype of the new Enterprise Portal in just four months.
The IT department was able to do the groundwork quickly and dynamically instead
of trying to handle everything itself and then taking eight years to implement it. In
this context, the IT department views itself as a technology partner who navigates
through the architecture – just like the Multi elevator which takes flexible new
routes. The role of IT is to boot up the backbone and then supply the necessary
dynamics on the frontend to the partners.
10.11 Conclusion
The goal is clear: move away from traditional IT and a decentralized IT environment
toward an integrated, standardized and consolidated data center solution. And
do it gradually so that the new IT department, the effects of the digital revolution,
the Internet of Things and the connections between people, machines and the
Internet move in the direction of Industry 4.0 and generate added value for the
company. I will not be satisfied until the end users say: “The result is convincing,
the transition was well-supported and all of this will create added value for us and
our company in the future.” And I am convinced that the cloud is the right platform
for us here.

100-Percent Security – A Desirable Goal? 11
Michael Weppler
In the summer of 2015, we learned that German Chancellor Merkel’s PC had
been infected by a virus. At the same time, the entire network of the German
parliament – including the computers belonging to all the members of parliament,
was infected by a trojan. The initial assessment by experts was that it would take
18 months to completely remove the malware from the IT infrastructure. What can
be done to prevent attacks like these? Can we not expect the highly sensitive
networks operating at the heart of our democratic process to be 100 percent secure?
In an era of smartphones, social media, big data and the cloud, security and
confidence are issues of increasing concern to IT managers. There are many
technical answers to these questions, but there are other issues of a more philosophical
nature about the digital world 2.0 that cannot be solved simply by bringing
in more IT, more control or more laws.
11.1 The Risk in Figures
The TU¨ V Rheinland technical inspection agency receives about 800,000 emails
every day, but only 150,000 actually get through to the employees’ mailboxes. In
other words: 80 percent of all the emails received are spam, and of those that do get
through, many can be deleted without a second thought. 20,000 people worldwide
work for this organization on 20,000 PCs, tablets and laptops – not including
smartphones. Each of these devices is therefore spammed an average of 30 times
a day – although of course not every email poses a threat to the entire system.
The numbers are as impressive as they are frightening because TU¨ V Rheinland
is a technical service provider without any large R&D departments. The company
does not own thousands of patents and its assets are not in the form of blueprints for

tomorrow’s high tech products: its assets are the minds of its employees, and
Trojans have so far been unable to penetrate that far. Companies whose business
model and competitive edge is computer-based report much higher figures.
This is why we should be more critical about, for example, the risk of interruptions
to Industry 4.0 data streams. Because any interruption of the data
streams to driverless cars, smart homes or smart factories in which the
components control their own manufacturing process could easily result in harm
or physical injury to people. These challenges have only come to light since
we entered the era of exabyte (approximately one million terabytes) data
storage and transmission. The cloud plays an important role here, and the
question has to be asked: Can we really rely on data being available at any time,
whenever it is needed?
11.2 The Inexorable Demand for Storage Capacity
Ten years ago, the cloud was something of a niche subject discussed mainly by
information technology specialists. Today, very little can happen without the cloud.
No matter how fast the price of terabyte memory cards falls, the demand for storage
capacity grows even faster. Importantly, demand is not continuous but – like power
consumption – it ebbs and flows. Power consumption is particularly high in the
morning, at noon, and in the half-time break in international soccer games.
A medium-sized company operating in the automotive component supplier industry
may need a huge amount of memory twice a year when, for example, it is completing
the development of a new component on which a global team, including the
customer, is working simultaneously in realtime and in 3D. Once the component is
ready, the memory is no longer needed. During this development phase, the
company therefore makes use of a cloud provider and very sensibly avoids having
to invest in its own data center.
The demand from the general public for storage capacity continues to rise to
exceptionally high levels. For example, more minutes of film are uploaded to
Youtube in two weeks than German television, including all commercial
broadcasters, have produced in total since they first began. A five minute loss of
service by Google would reduce the world’s Internet traffic by 40 percent.
Google Maps was used by one billion users every day in September 2014.
That makes the data-intensive map service the most successful product in
human history.
The current contents of YouTube would probably have filled the world’s entire
available disk storage space 15 years ago. And there is no reason why this trend
should not continue to gather pace.

11.3 Reliability Is Vital
When I bought a 386 computer in the early 1990s, my local PC dealer told me I was
making a purchase for life. Five years later, the only use I could find for the 386 was
as a glorified typewriter; the one MB hard drive seems almost prehistoric from
today’s perspective.
The positive side of the fall in prices is that space is no longer a limiting factor.
Just 5 years ago, hardware was so expensive that cloud providers wishing to offer
99.99 percent availability – which was considered theoretically possible – could not
have survived in business because customers were not willing to pay the price. Just
to clarify: 99.99 percent is the equivalent of a maximum of 52 minutes downtime
per year. In its “Zero Outage” quality assurance program, T-Systems now offers
99.999 percent cloud availability – the equivalent of a maximum downtime of about
five minutes a year. TU¨ V Rheinland has tested, audited and certified the process
that lies behind this initiative. The certification of a process is based on the
assumption that a well-organized process that is understood, supported and put
into practice by everyone concerned will always produce the same result. This aim
of the Zero Outage program is to limit cloud downtime for large T-Systems
customers to 0.001 percent, or preferably, zero percent.
Just ten years ago, the most common cause of system failure was loss of
electrical power. In Germany, power outages on the medium-voltage grid amount
to around ten hours per year, the best value in Europe. Blackouts covering entire
regions, such as those experienced in California, Virginia and other states in the US
every year as a result of natural disasters, are unknown. However, due to globalization,
they now affect us indirectly.
Just imagine a situation in which a major European telecoms company bills
customers for calls to the exact second and uses the data center in Ashburn,
Virginia, run by Amazon (the same data center that was crippled by a huge storm
in 2012). If the telecoms company is unable to calculate the duration of customer
calls, the drop in revenues could easily reach seven figures in just an hour, since
only its billing capability is affected and not the telephone service itself.
During the past 20 years, there has been no slowdown in the speed of technological
development or in the demand for storage. So why should the next 20 years
be any different? In the final analysis, the customer does not care whether the loss of
service was caused by a virus, a cyber attack, a staff member working on the inside,
or a power outage.
11.4 The Role of the IT Provider
What does this trend mean for companies using cloud services and for those who
offer these services? Does more effort have to be made to double and redouble data
security in complex systems? Or should we return to embedded systems that act
autonomously without any reference to the “outside world”? Or is there a third
way – and if so, what does it look like?
11 100-Percent Security – A Desirable Goal? 117
The following observation is very interesting from a psychological point of
view: If a company stores all of its data on its own computers in its own data center
with its own IT staff, it will tolerate some downtime. There are hardly any
companies able to guarantee 99.999 percent availability of their own IT systems
for their employees. 99 or even 99.9 percent would be considered a success. Yet if
the same company decides to outsource some of its data to cloud service providers,
they often expect 100 percent availability. The reasoning is: “Why would I outsource
my data if it wasn’t cheaper, better and more reliable?”
There is another side to this. People have a tendency to be trusting, and when
things are complex and difficult for the individual to understand, to have “blind”
faith in others. This applies whether you are spending money on food, car
accessories, textiles, the safety of a power plant or the confidentiality of a banking
advisor. We want to trust, and that is a good thing. This can lead to great disappointment
if it ultimately transpires that your trust was misplaced.
No one can deny today that the cloud is a growth driver. The fact that we need
more rather than less cloud is a consequence of this. But Wikileaks, Edward
Snowden and the NSA scandal have shaken our confidence in the security of data.
11.5 More Data, More Cloud Means Greater Demands
on Security
This is the trade-off we have to deal with. At the same time – at least in the view of
those in charge of Google – B2B and B2C models have now merged into a
homogeneous B2P (business-to-people) model. The divisions between private and
public, business and personal are being broken down.
In the era of the smartphone, the customer is king and the device is the scepter
with which he can directly and often quite emotionally inform the entire world of
his frustration with the “failure” of a manufacturer or service provider. And the tone
in the business community appears to be harsher and, above all, more personal.
You don’t have to think too hard, however, to realize that you cannot delegate
responsibility for data – especially if it is an integral part of your business – to third
parties entirely without risk. After all, there is no such thing as 100 percent security,
and the costs of providing security rise steeply the closer you get to 100 percent.
For example, are the apples we buy in the supermarket safe? How can we be sure
that nobody has injected them with something harmful or sprayed them with
poison? To guarantee 100 percent safety, we would have to cut each apple open
before selling it, examine it, and then unfortunately dispose of it because it would
no longer be fit for sale. So we have to balance our confidence in the supermarket
with the possible risks of buying poisoned food.
When the unexpected happens, there is an unfortunate tendency in our culture to
immediately look for someone to blame. We are often more interested in assigning
guilt than trying to learn how to prevent such things from happening again in the
future.
118 M. Weppler
So, we should not be concerned if the growth in the size of IT infrastructures is
making businesses more vulnerable, because the risks can be minimized through
the use of the appropriate security technology. We need to be aware of one thing,
however: tomorrow’s successful business models could not have happened without
the cloud, as the next four examples show.
– Uber is the world’s most successful taxi company. It doesn’t own a single taxi,
but it does have a lot of IT infrastructure.
– Facebook is the world’s largest media company. It has no content of its own, but
hosts content provided by its users.
– The Chinese company Alibaba is the world’s largest trading company, although
it does not manufacture any products or have any warehouse space.
– The world’s largest accommodation company is Airbnb, which does not own
any property.
What all of these four companies have in common is that they rely on your
confidence in their brand and your confidence that your data is safe with them.
And that is not always easy to achieve. After all, the countries in which these
companies base their data centers all have completely different legal standards
for the protection of data. Despite this, the companies have to guarantee 24/7
availability on all types of devices and applications anywhere in the world.
That is what you call B2P! Here, the expectations of the users of the service
align with the expectations of the companies in terms of IT system stability,
or “Zero Outage,” and cloud security.
What cannot be delegated to the cloud, or to providers such as T-Systems,
is the responsibility for one’s own commercial success. B2P users of the future
will be as powerless to delegate responsibility for supplying their own data as
Alibaba or Facebook. As long as we are clear about that, we will also accept
99.999 percent uptime and realize that 0.001 percent downtime is perfectly
reasonable.
11.6 Conclusion
The cloud is like the invention of printing. All of a sudden, people have access to
knowledge about the world, but to make use of it, they have to be able to read (and
understand). Programs like “Zero Outage” from T-Systems do not – to continue
with this simile – teach you how to read, but rather give you confidence in the
reading matter. Then it is up to you (or your company) to decide what to do with the
information. Being human means making mistakes – but learning from them in
order to improve.

Conclusion and Outlook 12
Ferri Abolhassan
What is driving digitalization today and why is the cloud such an integral part of it?
The analyses in this book by respected and experienced experts from industry,
business and the media show that the disruptive force of digitalization is radically
changing the way in which business works. Many analog business models and
processes are being replaced by digital concepts. The transformation has been
affecting all business sectors for some time – from publishing and the music
industry, to commerce, manufacturing and logistics (cf. Kempf 2014).
Thanks to streaming, the music industry now operates under a completely new
set of rules. The success of Uber is a good example of how an entire industry – in
this case, the taxi industry – is currently experiencing its own digital tsunami. Taxi
companies are trying to defend their traditional turf by formal, legal means. But
anyone who wants to play the digitalization game today needs a forward-looking
strategy.
Regardless of whether we are talking about apps used simultaneously by
millions of people, or improving medical care with intelligent pills, or mobile
applications that deliver safety-critical realtime information, or breaking down
local IT barriers so that staff can work together efficiently across national borders:
All of this relies on the cloud to function. Only the cloud can collect and centrally
store the infinite amounts of data being generated by the Internet of Things, and
then make use of that data with the aid of big data technologies. The cloud’s
capabilities are making it a key factor in tomorrow’s digitalized businesses, processes
and products. It has the requisite speed, intelligence and flexibility, and it has
the capacity and scalability. Managing such growing complexity and radical change
requires people with many years of highly advanced technological and consulting
expertise. Specialists with these skills are therefore in demand. After all, it takes a
great deal of experience to take an entire legacy infrastructure to the cloud. As tasks

go, this one has more in common with open heart surgery than taking a walk in
the park.
This book deals with this specific challenge and also explores the opportunities
of digital transformation. It provides an exhaustive 360-degree view of the entire
topic – from the organizational and technological fundamentals, to requirements in
areas such as security, quality and standardization, through to real-life practical
examples. It provides practical guidance for CIOs and IT managers, as well as for
CEOs, on how to optimize their digital business models and carry out the transformation
their businesses urgently need.
This book charts a path and provides clear directions. There are three central
propositions that point to the direction that future trends are likely to take:
12.1 The Cloud Is Normality and the Market Is Growing
The examples provided in the various chapters show that the cloud has become an
integral part of normality for consumers and businesses alike. It is impossible to
imagine many business or consumer applications – not to mention business processes
– functioning without the cloud. All business sectors can benefit from the
power of the cloud and the flexibility and scalability it offers. The examples given
in this book demonstrate this unequivocally. This trend will continue. The cloud
will grow in importance for both businesses and consumers in the future.
While today’s technologies and applications may have been inconceivable
ten years ago, the innovative power of the cloud has now changed whole industries
and created new ones. We can only speculate about where this trend is heading, how
fast it will develop, and which innovations will shape society in the future. What we
do know for certain is that the importance of the cloud and digitalization continues
to increase across all industries. In the ICT industry alone, it has made tremendous
strides. Seven out of ten (71 percent) ICT companies currently (as at 2015) use
cloud solutions (cf. Bitkom 2015). This is a seven percent increase over the
previous year. The more traditional sectors such as the auto industry, banks,
insurance companies or chemicals and pharmaceuticals are also expanding their
use of cloud solutions. This trend will carry on over the next few years and
contribute to growth in the size of the market and in the number of potential uses
for cloud solutions.
12.2 The Cloud Is and Will Remain a Collaborative World
The developments over recent years have revealed a fundamental truth: Nothing
happens without partnerships. The market is not only experiencing a steady upward
trend, it is also extremely dynamic. But enterprises need the relevant expertise and
the right partner if they want their customers to benefit from improved quality,
flexibility and efficiency in their fast-moving daily business and if they want to
successfully tackle the challenges they will face tomorrow. Digitalization and the
transformation to the cloud require technology and expertise together with the
122 F. Abolhassan
manpower capable of delivering highly complex solutions and services. It is not a
simple matter to transfer, for example, tens of thousands of employees or thousands
of applications to the cloud. It requires specialist support. It needs experts with
years of experience in the digitalization and optimization of business processes –
experts who are also familiar with the technical requirements and implementation
options. These partners rely in turn on an entire partner ecosystem that includes
hardware and software suppliers. Technologies are changing so rapidly today that it
takes a value-creating collaborative network to transform businesses safely and
reliably.
12.3 The Cloud Must Be Simple, Reliable and Affordable
Regardless of where companies are on their own road to digital transformation,
there are some key questions that they should always ask. What requirements does
the cloud have to meet within the company? Where will it create business value,
competitive advantage or improved customer loyalty? How can cloud technology
improve efficiency and reduce costs? Then there is the question of finding the right
form of cloud. Do you need a public, private or a hybrid cloud? Here, CIOs are
increasingly differentiating between commodity and non-commodity IT. Other
questions to ask are: Which business processes contain data-sensitive workflows
or information and require special attention in terms of security and quality? Or,
how can we provide, for example, a stylish, lean app that delivers a straightforward
and positive user experience while at the same time ensuring the security of
customer data?
Whatever the conclusion each individual company reaches on these matters, it is
evident that, in addition to maximum scalability and performance, the cloud must
meet three criteria both now and in the future: It must be simple, it must be secure
and it must be affordable – for large enterprises as well as for small and mid-sized
companies and for end customers.
Equally important, the technology must evolve in line with user expectations.
Solutions taking the first step towards delivering integrated solutions to clients
include software-defined data centers, which offer users IT-as-a-service on
demand – along with, of course, high reliability, availability and data security.
And efficiency – which is why standardization and automation continue to increase.
A look at the current state of play and trends for the future make it clear that
cloud is a major issue that will ultimately impact businesses in all industries. In
spite of this, some 25 percent of German IT decision-makers still do not have the
cloud on their agenda (cf. B€ust and Crisp Research 2015). This book provides some
useful starting points and principles for getting to grips with the tasks that lie ahead
and moving successfully into the future. The first step has been taken. It is now up to
all those with the capacity to do so to accept the responsibility of taking the next
steps that will lead towards a profitable future.
