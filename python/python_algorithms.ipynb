Index notation is often the clearest way to express definitions, and is used as standard in the literature. The entry in row i, column j of matrix A is indicated by (A)ij, Aij or aij.

    "The travelling salesman problem (also called the travelling salesperson problem or TSP) asks the following question: \"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?\" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The travelling purchaser problem and the vehicle routing problem are both generalizations of TSP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the theory of computational complexity, the decision version of the TSP (where given a length L, the task is to decide whether the graph has a tour of at most L) belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. Thus, it is possible that the worst-case running time for any algorithm for the TSP increases superpolynomially (but no more than exponentially) with the number of cities.\n",

    "<strong>Heuristic and approximation algorithms</strong><br>\n",
    "Various heuristics and approximation algorithms, which quickly yield good solutions, have been devised. These include the Multi-fragment algorithm. Modern methods can find solutions for extremely large problems (millions of cities) within a reasonable time which are with a high probability just 2–3% away from the optimal solution."
